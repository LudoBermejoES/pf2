# Momentary Magic

This section contains magical items with the consumable trait, which might turn the tide of battle but are destroyed after activation.

---

## Ammunition

These magic items are ammunition for ranged weapons. Each item's stat block includes an Ammunition entry that lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as, or "any" if it's not limited to any particular type. All stat blocks for ammunition omit the Usage and Bulk entries; use the standard rules in Chapter 6 of Player Core for the type of ammunition to determine reloading times and Bulk.

When using magic ammunition, use your ranged weapon's fundamental runes to determine the attack modifier and damage dice. Don't add the effects of your weapon's property runes unless the ammunition states otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic ammunition deals damage on a hit normally in addition to any listed effects unless its description states otherwise.

Regardless of whether an attack with magic ammunition hits or misses, launching the ammunition consumes its magic. Magic ammunition is made of normal materials, not precious materials, unless stated otherwise.

### Antler Arrow · Item 2

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical

**Price** 7 gp

**Ammunition** arrow

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

The creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain an escaping foe. When an activated antler arrow hits a target, glowing antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow (Player Core 283). If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15.

---

### Corrosive Ammunition · Item 7

**Traits:** Acid, Consumable, Magical

**Price** 70 gp

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This peculiar ammunition is coated in yellow dust that leaves a stain on anything it touches. When activated corrosive ammunition hits a target, it dissolves across the target's armor. The armor takes 1d8 persistent acid damage that ignores the armor's Hardness; if the target isn't wearing armor, it takes the acid damage instead. This damage occurs at the end of the target's turns.

The creature can end this effect by spending an Interact action to wipe off the corrosive dust. Otherwise, the effect ends once the armor becomes broken.

---

### Disintegration Bolt · Item 15

**Traits:** Uncommon, Consumable, Magical

**Price** 1,300 gp

**Ammunition** bolt

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it's subject to a disintegrate spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target's saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of disintegrate.

---

### Freezing Ammunition · Item 5

**Traits:** Cold, Consumable, Magical

**Price** 25 gp

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This chilly ammunition is dark blue and cold to the touch. When activated freezing ammunition hits a target, the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for 1 round by the intense cold (slowed 1 for 1 minute on a critical failure).

---

### Slumber Arrow · Item 3

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Mental, Sleep

**Price** 10 gp

**Ammunition** arrow

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

Sleep arrows often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated sleep arrow deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it grows lethargic and must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. On a failure, it takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round, and is also slowed 1 for 1 round on a critical failure.

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of sleep.

---

### Storm Arrow · Item 9

**Traits:** Air, Consumable, Electricity, Magical

**Price** 130 gp

**Ammunition** arrow

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper. When an activated storm arrow hits a target, it's buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 3d12 electricity damage, and the target must attempt a DC 25 Reflex saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a shock property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn't benefit from the shock property rune itself.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and isn't affected by the wind.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for 1 round, taking a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.

---

### Terrifying Ammunition · Item 6

**Traits:** Consumable, Emotion, Fear, Magical, Mental

**Price** 50 gp

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated terrifying ammunition damages a creature, the creature's mind is filled with visions of its failures, its tragedies, and eventually, its own death. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is frightened 1.

**Failure** The creature is frightened 1 and can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which has the concentrate trait, to calm itself down.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is frightened 2.

---

### Viper Arrow · Item 4

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical

**Price** 17 gp

**Ammunition** arrow

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an activated viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into a viper (Monster Core 316). The target is affected by the viper's venom, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open space adjacent to the target.

The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of your turn, even though you didn't use the Sustain action. It's under the GM's control, but it generally attacks the creature the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain.

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of summon animal.

## Oils

Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that are typically applied to an object and are used up in the process. They have the oil trait. Applying an oil usually takes two hands: one to hold the jar containing the oil, and another to extract the oil and apply it. You can only apply an oil to an item or creature within your reach. Because the process is so thorough, it's usually impossible to apply an oil to an unwilling target or an item in the possession of an unwilling target unless that target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.

---

### Oil of Dynamism · Item 8+

**Traits:** Uncommon, Consumable, Magical, Oil

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆◆ (manipulate)

This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully spreading the oil over an object turns it into an animated object (Monster Core 18–19) of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an animated statue. If the animated object's level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails.

This animated object has the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.

| Type | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Oil of dynamism | 8 | 85 gp | Can animate objects of level 3 or lower |
| Greater oil of dynamism | 16 | 1,400 gp | Can animate objects of level 11 or lower |

---

### Oil of Revelation · Item 5

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Oil

**Price** 25 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This bright oil, first created by humans as a tool to help them fight in darkness, holds flecks of tiny gemstones in suspension and smells like a struck matchstick.

The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the creature is invisible, the light's position means it's merely hidden to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than undetected. The light also negates the concealed condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn't damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.

---

### Shielding Salve · Item 1

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Oil

**Price** 4 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This shimmering paste has many properties of a shield spell. When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. The first time a physical attack or a force barrage hits the target during that round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and then the oil's effect ends.

---

### Tricky Liniment · Item 5

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Oil

**Price** 25 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This greenish, persistent grease can be applied to armor to make it extremely slippery for 8 hours, granting the wearer a +2 item bonus to Acrobatics checks to Escape or to Squeeze.

---

## Potions

A potion is a magical liquid that's activated when you drink it, which uses it up. Potions have the potion trait. You can activate a potion with an Interact action as you drink it or feed it to another creature. You can feed a potion only to a creature that's within reach and willing or otherwise so helpless that it can't resist. You usually need only one hand to consume a potion or feed it to another creature.

---

### Potion of Disguise · Item 5+

**Traits:** Uncommon, Consumable, Magical, Polymorph, Potion

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

Upon imbibing this potion, you take on the appearance of a specific type of creature for 2d12 hours. The type of creature is determined when the potion is created. For example, you might have a potion of elf disguise or potion of frog disguise. Drinking the potion doesn't impart the knowledge of how long the effect lasts; the GM rolls the duration in secret.

The disguise doesn't change your traits or statistics, nor does it give you any of the special abilities of the creature you're imitating. It might affect what items you can hold or wear (for example, your new form might lack opposable thumbs). The potion shrinks you down to a minimum of size Small or maintains your size if the creature is your size or larger. For example, if you are Medium and drink a potion of fire giant disguise, you'll take on the appearance of a fire giant but remain Medium. The creature has to be of a specific kind, such as "leopard" or "lion" rather than just "cat," or "fire giant" or "ogre" rather than just "giant," but the potion can't cause you to mimic a specific individual creature.

The effects of this potion use the same rules as the Impersonate activity of Deception. Onlookers always assume you're the chosen type of creature unless they're actively Seeking. You gain a +4 status bonus to your Deception DC against such Perception checks and add your level even if untrained.

| Type | Level | Price | Craft Requirements |
|------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Lesser | 5 | 30 gp | Initial raw materials must include a bit of blood, hair, or flesh of the creature the potion will allow the drinker to imitate. |
| Moderate | 8 | 100 gp | As lesser, plus the potion can increase your size if the creature is larger than you, to a maximum of Large, and it can shrink you to a creature of size Tiny. This doesn't change any of your statistics, with the exception of reducing your reach to 0 feet as a Tiny creature. |
| Greater | 11 | 300 gp | While drinking the potion, if you picture the specific form you want to transform into, the potion will change you into that form. You can attempt to Impersonate a specific individual, though you still need to roll Deception. |

---

### Potion of Emergency Escape · Item 1

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Potion

**Price** 3 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

The stopper for a potion of emergency escape is crafted to easily snap open in dire circumstances. When you drink this potion, you become fleeing for 1 minute, and you gain a +40-foot status bonus to all your Speeds for the duration as long as you're fleeing. You immediately Stride.

---

### Potion of Retaliation · Item 1+

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Potion

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

A potion of retaliation is available in four varieties—acid, cold, electricity, and fire—each with a faint shimmer of the energy it contains. For 1 minute after drinking a potion of retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of that energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) takes damage of that type. The moderate, greater, and major versions also damage an adjacent creature that hits you with a melee weapon Strike.

| Type | Level | Price | Damage |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Minor | 1 | 4 gp | 1 damage |
| Lesser | 3 | 12 gp | 1d4 damage |
| Moderate | 6 | 50 gp | 2d4 damage |
| Greater | 12 | 400 gp | 3d6 damage |
| Major | 18 | 5,000 gp | 4d8 damage |

---

### Ration Tonic · Item 1+

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Potion

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This slender vial appears to hold clean, clear water with a faintly fruity scent. Drinking a ration tonic magically nourishes you with the equivalent of a day's worth of food and water. The tonic has a subtle, pleasant taste, its particulars chosen when the potion is crafted.

| Type | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Ration tonic | 1 | 3 gp | Nourishes for 1 day |
| Greater ration tonic | 7 | 55 gp | Nourishes for 1 week, distributing the nourishment in a constant and healthy flow across the week |

---

## Talismans

In addition to the talismans found on pages 263–267 of GM Core, you can purchase the following talismans.

---

### Balisse Feather · Item 12+

**Traits:** Consumable, Holy, Magical, Talisman

**Usage** affixed to a weapon; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◇ (concentrate) **Trigger** You deal damage using the affixed weapon to a creature that has the unholy trait or that you witnessed harm an ally, an innocent, or a noncombatant within the last minute.

This long, fire-red feather smolders from the weapon it adorns. When you activate the feather, the creature you damaged burns with sacred light. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a –2 status penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by 5. These effects last until the end of your next turn. This item has no effect on a creature with the holy trait.

| Type | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Balisse feather | 12 | 400 gp | DC 29, resistances reduced by 5 |
| Greater balisse feather | 16 | 2,000 gp | DC 35, resistances reduced by 10 |

### Flame Navette · Item 16

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Talisman

**Price** 1,800 gp

**Usage** affixed to armor; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆ (concentrate)

This piece of bronzite is shaped like an oval with points at both ends. It has a carved flame at its center and is traditionally worn over the heart. You can activate only one flame navette per day. When you activate the navette, you gain the benefit of the fighter's Determination class feat (Player Core 149), with a counteract rank of 8 and a counteract modifier of +22.

If you have the Determination feat, you can use your own modifier if it's better.

---

### Hunter's Bane · Item 2

**Price** 6 gp

**Usage** affixed to armor; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◇ (concentrate) **Trigger** A hidden or undetected enemy hits you with an attack; **Requirements** You're trained in Survival.

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven pieces of straw. When you activate the hunter's bane, you sense the exact location of the attacker. It becomes observed by you if it was hidden from you or becomes hidden from you if it was undetected. If the attacker is behind lead, the hunter's bane has no effect.

---

### Iron Cudgel · Item 14

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Talisman

**Price** 900 gp

**Usage** affixed to a melee weapon; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This miniature club is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use Brutal Finish, as the fighter feat (Player Core 148). You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the press trait.

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add an additional weapon damage die on a success or a failure to the normal results.

---

### Iron Equalizer · Item 12

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Talisman

**Price** 400 gp

This small iron band has a shifting weight that helps equalize the affixed weapon's balance. When you activate it, you use Certain Strike, as the fighter feat (Player Core 147). You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the press trait.

If you have the Certain Strike feat, the failure effect increases to deal the weapon's normal damage.

---

### Jade Bauble · Item 8

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Mental, Talisman

**Price** 100 gp

**Usage** affixed to a melee weapon; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆ (concentrate)

This bit of jade is usually carved in the shape of a duelist, or sometimes a multi-armed creature. When you activate the bauble, it magically draws the attention of foes. Until the start of your next turn, enemies within the reach of the weapon the talisman is affixed to are off-guard.

---

## Wondrous Consumables

Though many consumables are grouped into specific categories, such as potions and talismans, some consumables don't fit into those categories.

---

### Candle of Revealing · Item 7

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical

**Price** 60 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

When lit, this black candle's eerie blue flame reveals the presence of invisible creatures. Within a 10-foot radius of the lit candle, creatures don't benefit from the invisible condition. Their bodies are outlined, not fully visible, so they're concealed. Once lit, the candle burns for 1 minute, after which the effect ends. If extinguished, it can't be relit.

---

### Dust of Corpse Animation · Item 8+

**Traits:** Uncommon, Consumable, Magical

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆◆ (manipulate)

This black pouch contains what appears to be fine bone dust. Pouring the dust in a special pattern over a corpse turns it into an undead creature. The type of undead created depends on the condition of the corpse, resulting in either a skeleton (Monster Core 312) or a zombie (Monster Core 356). If the undead's level would be greater than 3, the dust fails to animate it. The body must be of an appropriate size and type for the undead you wish to create—for example, you must sprinkle the dust on a horse's skeleton to animate a skeletal horse. If more than one undead in the level range is appropriate, such as skeletal guard or skeletal champion for a Medium humanoid skeleton, you choose.

The animated undead has the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The undead creature remains animated for 1 minute before collapsing back into its corpse form. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.

| Type | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Dust of corpse animation | 8 | 100 gp | Can animate undead of level 3 or lower |
| Greater dust of corpse animation | 16 | 1,500 gp | Can animate undead of level 11 or lower |

---

### Incense of Distilled Death · Item 12

**Traits:** Consumable, Magical, Void

**Price** 350 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This black incense smells of fresh earth and ash. You activate the incense by lighting it, whereupon it fills a 10-foot emanation with oily smoke and potent void energy. Undead creatures gain fast healing 4 while in the area; though this healing comes from void energy, it doesn't negatively impact living creatures. Once lit, the incense burns for 1 minute, and it can't be extinguished.

---

### Taper of Sanctification · Item 13

**Traits:** Uncommon, Consumable, Divine

**Price** 600 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** —

**Activate** ◆ (manipulate)

This thin golden candle bears the symbol of a specific deity emblazoned on its surface, surrounded by the iconography of that deity's faith. A taper of sanctification must be dedicated to a deity who can be sanctified to holy or unholy, and has the corresponding trait. If the deity's sanctification lists both options, the crafter must choose one when the candle is made.

Once lit, this candle burns for 1 hour, and it can't be extinguished. When a willing creature spends the full hour within 10 feet of the lit candle engaging in prayer to the deity, that creature's Strikes gain the holy or unholy trait (as appropriate for the candle) until the next time that creature makes their daily preparations. During this time, the creature is bound by the deity's anathema. If they violate anathema, they lose the benefit of the taper of sanctification. A holy creature can't benefit from an unholy taper of sanctification, nor can an unholy creature benefit from a holy one.
