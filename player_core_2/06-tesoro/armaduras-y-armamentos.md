# Armor & Armaments

Seasoned warriors search for any edge they can find, including magical weapons and armor. Beyond their runes, many of these items possess special powers of their own.

## Armor

These suits of armor have abilities far different from what can be gained by etching runes. A specific magic armor lists its fundamental runes, which you can upgrade, add, or transfer as normal. You can't etch or transfer any property runes onto a specific armor that it doesn't already have or remove its property runes.

### Dragonplate · Item 16

**Traits:** Uncommon, Invested, Magical

**Price** 10,000 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 4

This suit of +2 greater resilient dragonhide (page 276) full plate makes you look like a fearsome dragon. The armor comes in many different varieties depending on the type of dragon from which it's made, though they usually conform to the four magical traditions.

**Activate—Dragon Breath** ◆◆ (manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You unleash a 15-foot cone of energy with a damage type and saving throw corresponding to the tradition of the dragon used to make the armor (shown on the table below). The cone deals 14d6 damage; each creature in the area must attempt a DC 36 basic saving throw.

| Dragon Tradition | Damage (Save) |
|------------------|---------------|
| Arcane | Force (Reflex) |
| Divine | Spirit (Reflex) |
| Occult | Mental (Will) |
| Primal | Poison (Fortitude) |

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1,250 gp of dragonhide.

### Ghoul Hide · Item 6

**Traits:** Uncommon, Invested, Magical

**Price** 220 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 2

Stitched together from pieces of ghoul skin, this suit of +1 hide armor grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against curses and makes you immune to the stench of ghouls. Ghoul hide with a resilient rune increases the resilient rune's item bonus to saving throws against curses by 1 (maximum +4).

---

### Holy Chain · Item 13

**Traits:** Divine, Holy, Invested

**Price** 2,500 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1

This suit of +2 resilient chain mail is made of fine white links of a strange and slightly translucent pale metal, and the sleeves and skirt are fashioned into smaller trails that resemble feathers. Unlike normal chain mail, holy chain has no Speed reduction, its armor check penalty is 0, and its Bulk is 1.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against fiends. You appear radiant while you wear the armor, giving you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks against all creatures except fiends.

If you're unholy, you're drained 2 while wearing holy chain. You can't recover from this condition while wearing the armor.

**Activate—Celestial Flight** ◆ (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The armor sprouts glowing wings that grant you a fly Speed of 30 feet. The wings shed bright light in a 40-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet). The wings fade away after 10 minutes.

**Craft Requirements** You're holy.

### Mariner's Splint · Item 5

**Traits:** Uncommon, Invested, Magical

**Price** 180 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 3

This suit of +1 splint mail is worn by veteran sailors aboard warships who want as much protection as possible but still need to remain mobile enough to climb up rigging or swim should the need arise. The plates are arranged for maximum flexibility and the undercoat of padded armor is often no more than a cotton shrift. The armor grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb or Swim and increases the distance you move when you successfully Climb or Swim by 5 feet.

---

### Onslaught Hide · Item 9

**Traits:** Invested, Magical

**Price** 700 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 2

This +1 resilient hide armor is decorated with the horns of many slain beasts. It has an armor check penalty of –1 instead of –2. When you use the Sudden Charge class feat while wearing this armor, your Strike deals an additional 1d8 damage.

---

### Unholy Plate · Item 13

**Traits:** Divine, Invested, Unholy

**Price** 2,500 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 4

Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of +2 resilient full plate is designed to make you look like a horned demon with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.

While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet's horns. They're a martial melee weapon with the effects of a +2 weapon potency rune. They deal 2d8 piercing damage and have the deadly d12 and unholy traits. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude or become drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). The horns can't be etched with any runes.

If you're holy, you're drained 2 and can't recover from this condition while wearing unholy plate.

**Activate—Demonic Slip** ◆◆ (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You cast translocate.

**Craft Requirements** You're unholy; supply one casting of translocate.

### Warleader's Bulwark · Item 10+

**Traits:** Invested, Magical

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 2

This +1 resilient breastplate is made from shining bronze overlaid with reinforcing golden panels emblazoned with images of loyal soldiers. Wearing this breastplate grants you a commanding aura. You gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks, but you take a –2 item penalty to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak and Deception checks to Impersonate.

**Activate—Command Bravery** ◆ (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You grant allies within 100 feet a +2 status bonus to saves against fear effects for 1 minute. When you activate this ability, each affected ally who's frightened reduces their frightened value by 1.

| Type | Level | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Warleader's bulwark | 10 | 1,000 gp |
| Greater warleader's bulwark | 18 | 22,000 gp |

The greater warleader's bulwark is a +2 greater resilient breastplate. The item bonus and penalty increase to +3 and –3, respectively.

## Shields

In addition to their normal protection, these shields offer interesting abilities for the wielder. Like other shields, the following specific shields can be etched with reinforcing runes (GM Core 232).

### Exploding Shield · Item 5

**Traits:** Magical

**Price** 25 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

The magic within this wooden shield (Hardness 3, HP 12, BT 6) lashes out at your foes as the shield is destroyed.

**Activate—Splintering Boom** ◇ (manipulate) **Trigger** The exploding shield is destroyed; **Effect** The shield explodes outward, dealing 4d6 piercing damage to each creature in a 15-foot cone (DC 19 basic Reflex save).

---

### Glamorous Buckler · Item 2

**Traits:** Illusion, Magical

**Price** 35 gp

**Usage** strapped to 1 hand; **Bulk** L

A glamorous buckler (Hardness 3, HP 6, BT 3) is lavishly decorated with gilding and inset gemstones that glitter in the light. While you have it raised, the glamorous buckler grants you a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Feint.

**Activate—Dazzling Feint** ◇ (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** You Feint; **Requirements** You have the glamorous buckler raised; **Effect** As you Feint, the glamorous buckler sparkles mightily. On a successful Feint, the target is dazzled for 1 round.

### Medusa's Scream · Item 13+

**Traits:** Magical

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

The ghastly visage of a slain medusa's head stares out from this steel shield (Hardness 5, HP 20, BT 10). The shield comes with a thick leather cover to conceal the head.

**Activate—Petrifying Gaze** ◆◆ (manipulate, visual) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You reveal the medusa's face, focusing its gaze on one creature within 30 feet. The shield casts a DC 30 petrify spell with a range of 30 feet.

| Type | Level | Price | Stats |

## Magic Weapons

These specific weapons expand on the options included in GM Core (page 241) and follow the same rules.

### Chalice of Justice · Item 14

**Traits:** Uncommon, Divine, Holy

**Price** 4,500 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

This gleaming golden sword is a +2 greater striking holy cold iron longsword given only to the worthiest heroes of a holy faith. It's made of a sacred, secret alloy that makes the blade both cold iron and silver. If you're unholy, you're drained 2 while holding a chalice of justice. You can't recover from this condition while holding the weapon.

**Activate—Sip of Justice** ◆ (manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The pommel of the weapon transmutes into the shape of a miniature chalice. You drink deep from the chalice and regain HP equal to the chalice's level. If you're holy, you regain double the HP, and for 1 minute, whenever you critically hit an unholy creature with the chalice of justice, the creature takes 2d6 persistent spirit damage, and it's slowed 1 for 1 round. The persistent spirit damage has the holy trait.

**Craft Requirements** You're holy.

### Four-Ways Dogslicer · Item 12

**Traits:** Uncommon, Cold, Electricity, Fire, Magical

**Price** 1,700 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This +2 striking dogslicer is obviously the work of a brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four toothy gems line the blade's cutting edge, three of which glow—one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks—while the last is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active at a time.

**Activate—Gem Twist** ◆ (manipulate) **Effect** You twist the gem along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon property rune: red for flaming, blue for frost, or yellow for shock. You take 1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the active property rune, taking no damage.

### Infiltrator's Accessory · Item 5

**Traits:** Illusion, Magical

**Price** 150 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

This elegant +1 striking sword cane serves equally well as both a fashionable accessory and a hidden weapon suitable for high-society events where weapons aren't typically permitted.

**Activate—Hide Magic** ◆ (manipulate) **Effect** You twist the sword cane's hilt, magically merging the blade into the cane. While the blade is merged, it can't be drawn and gains the benefits of a 3rd-rank disguise magic spell to appear non-magical. Passive observers can't attempt a check to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane, if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining it can discern the cane is more than it appears, but doing so is extremely difficult (DC 30 Perception). Activating the sword cane again releases the blade, allowing it to be drawn normally.

---

### Spellguard Blade · Item 7

**Traits:** Magical

**Price** 320 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

The guard of this +1 striking main-gauche is inscribed with eldritch glyphs that guard against magic. When you're benefiting from the circumstance bonus to AC from this weapon's parry trait, you also apply that circumstance bonus to your saving throws against spells that target you.

---

### Spiritsight Crossbow · Item 8

**Traits:** Uncommon, Magical

**Price** 450 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 2

This +1 striking ghost touch crossbow has an array of crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels strangely light.

**Activate—Ethereal Vision** ◆ (concentrate) **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You aim through the crossbow's crystalline lenses, gaining imprecise vision onto the Ethereal Plane with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses until the end of your turn. You can sense through objects in the Universe this way, and the sense is precise for detecting creatures. Because this sense detects spiritual energy, a creature that's immune to spirit can't be detected in this way.

**Activate—Ethereal Shot** ◆ **Requirements** Ethereal Vision is active; **Effect** You Strike with the spiritsight crossbow. This shot travels through the Ethereal Plane, allowing it to pass through and ignore cover from physical objects within the range of your Ethereal Vision.
