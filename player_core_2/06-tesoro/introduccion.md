# Chapter 6: Treasure Trove

The investigator's trusty detective tools, a swashbuckler's flashy dueling cape, and a champion's shining armor are nearly as iconic as the characters who use them. For any hero, the gear and treasure they wield and collect throughout their adventures can play as important a role as any other facet of their character, from weapons steeped in cultural history to fantastic treasures of unparalleled worth!

This chapter presents a variety of brand-new equipment and treasure that expands on and supplements the options provided in Chapter 6: Equipment of Player Core and Chapter 5: Treasure Trove of GM Core. In particular, the gear that follows is especially suitable for the new ancestries and classes presented in this book, but this multitude of new items can enhance and enrich all types of characters. Rules for activating and investing items, as well as a guide for reading an item's stat block, begin on page 219 of GM Core.

## Weapons & Materials

Information on new weapons and a rare special material begins on page 276. This section includes class kits for the new classes presented in this book, so you can quickly equip a new character with the armor, weapons, and gear they'll need to start adventuring! The full rules for weapons and adventuring gear appear in Chapter 6 of Player Core. This section also contains the new precious material dragonhide.

## Armor & Armaments

This section has a new assortment of new magic armor, shields, and weapons that are all specific items. If you want to create such an item with only abilities from runes, use those found in GM Core.

## Alchemical Items

Alchemical items are consumable, non-magical items that rely on the properties of volatile alchemical reagents to produce their effects. Alchemical items also appear starting on page 244 of GM Core, but this book contains all those items and more, particularly for the use of the alchemist class. The alchemical items in this book are presented by level in the Alchemical Items by Level Table on pages 281–282 as a reference for alchemists and other characters with alchemical abilities.

## Snares

Snares are small, simple traps to damage or hamper your foes that you can create and deploy quickly enough to utilize on a battlefield. Snares are nonmagical consumable items. This section includes the full rules for creating and using snares. The Snare Crafting feat (page 234) and snarecrafter archetype (page 216) are the primary ways to gain snares.

## Momentary Magic

The items in this section are consumables. An item with the consumable trait can be used only once and is then destroyed. Here you'll find new ammunition, oils, potions, talismans, and wondrous consumables.

## Trappings of Power

The permanent items found here are typically held in the hands or worn on the body. These include new held items, staves, a variety of specific magic wands, and worn items.

## Treasure Table

The Treasure Table on pages 312–314 presents all the new items appearing in this book, organized by level and item category to help you find the appropriate gear for your character or adventure. The tables are divided by level, split into consumables or permanents, and then organized by item categories within each table.
