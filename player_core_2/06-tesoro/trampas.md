# Snares

Snares are simple traps that can be created quickly with the Snare Crafting feat (page 234) to injure or bedevil intruders. Unlike other items, found snares can't be collected or sold in their complete form. Snares have the snare trait.

---

## Crafting Snares

A snare is built within a single 5-foot square. Only one snare can occupy a single 5-foot square at a time. Once constructed, it can't be moved without destroying (and often triggering) the snare. Snares usually last until they're triggered, though at the GM's discretion, certain snares might become inert after extended periods of time (such as months or years). Snares made for quick deployment, such as those from the Snarecrafter archetype, are less durable and become inert after 24 hours.

You must have the Snare Crafting feat as well as be wielding or wearing a snare toolkit (which is a type of artisan's toolkit, as found on page 287 of Player Core) to create snares. You can spend 1 minute to Craft a snare by expending an amount of money equal to the snare's listed Price. This expenditure represents the use of raw materials that are included in your snare toolkit. If you want to Craft a snare at a discount, you must spend downtime as described in the Craft activity. Some snares have additional requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these snares list their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry. Despite having the consumable trait, you make only one snare when you spend the minute to Craft a snare.

## Detecting Snares

Creatures can detect snares they aren't already aware of as they would any trap or hazard (as described on page 98 of GM Core), using the creator's Crafting DC as the snare's Stealth DC. If your proficiency rank is expert or better in Crafting, only creatures actively searching can find your snares.

## Triggering Snares

Unless stated otherwise in a snare's description, when a Small or larger creature enters a snare's square, the snare's effect occurs, and then the snare is destroyed.

## Disabling Snares

Once a creature discovers a snare, it can disable it much like it can other physical traps, using the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill and using the Crafting DC of the snare's creator as the DC. You can automatically disarm a snare that you personally Crafted without triggering it by taking an Interact action while adjacent to the snare.

Snares can't be targeted by Strikes or other attacks unless otherwise noted. At the GM's discretion, a snare might be triggered or destroyed by a particularly large effect, such as a boulder rolling through the snare's square, or an area effect that specifically mentions unattended objects, such as hydraulic torrent.

A subtle snare used in hunting or tracking, a signaling snare often consists of carefully prepared earth, piled sand or stones, specific arrangements of vegetation, and so forth.
