## Weapons

From tripkee clubs to catfolk blades to tengu slings, many of the weapons presented here are often used by particular societies.

### New Weapon Traits

The weapons in this section use the following new traits, in addition to those found on pages 282–283 of Player Core.

**Hampering:** A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. After you hit with the weapon, you can use an Interact action to give the target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds. The penalty ends after the target takes a move action, at the start of your next turn, if you attack with the weapon, or if you move out of reach of the target, whichever comes first.

**Modular:** The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as "modular B, P, or S"), though it's possible for a modular weapon's description to list more complicated configurations.

**Razing:** This weapon is particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including shields and animated objects), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

**Tethered:** This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand (including if you've just thrown a two-handed tethered weapon and have a hand holding nothing but the weapon's tether), you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it's being held by another creature).

### Weapon Descriptions

Each of the weapons listed in the weapon tables are described below.

**Adze:** A common cutting tool, an adze resembles an axe—but the cutting edge is horizontal, rather than vertical. The adze's shape makes it popular among woodworkers, and tripkee builders often use them to construct their treetop homes. The tool also serves as an effective weapon, due in part to the immense strength required to swing it.

**Breaching Pike:** Forged with a heavy metal wedge effective at damaging enemy shields, breaching pikes are often used by hobgoblin infantry alongside a tower shield.

**Capturing Spetum:** Hobgoblins use these polearms both as standard issue for aggressive military units and on an individual basis for hunting fugitives.

**Claw Blade:** This handheld weapon's three parallel blades extend between the fingers to resemble the natural claws of the amurruns who created them, providing a way for those catfolk without suitable natural claws to share the fighting customs of their kin.

**Cruuk:** This specialized club is designed for throwing and useful in both combat and hunting. Tripkees use them to take down creatures that hide high in treetops.

**Daikyu:** This asymmetrical bow, made of laminated bamboo, wood, and leather, stands 6 feet or more in height. It's most often used while mounted.

**Fangwire:** This kobold wire is thin and hard to see, making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder flicks one handle around a vulnerable spot so that it serves as a catch for the wire, then yanks the other handle back, pulling the wire tight and inflicting painful lacerations. The function and name come from a wire-based trap called a "slow fang."

**Hand Adze:** The adze's smaller version is useful for delicate woodworking in cramped spaces. Tripkees use hand adzes for crafting and as close quarters weapons.

**Khopesh:** This curved sickle sword has a pointed tip, allowing it to be swung in wide arcs or thrust vertically around enemy defenses. The tip of a khopesh is hooked and can be used to trip an opponent.

**Mambele:** Also known as a hunga munga or danisco, this knife-axe hybrid consists of a hilt and blade that curves backward toward the wielder. The blade's curve is such that, after a mambele has struck a victim, more damage is dealt as the weapon is extracted from the victim's body.

**Flying Talon:** This weapon consists of a three-pronged barbed hook attached to a length of chain. It can be used in melee to stab foes or hurled at a range. Some kobolds are particularly fond of using flying talons, especially as a sort of badge of office above those who serve them.

**Spirit Thresher:** Bones, some solid and others splintered, are affixed to metal chains at the end of a long stick to form a powerful flail. Many kholo warriors insist the vicious crack the weapon makes as it strikes loosens fragments of the soul like husks struck from grains.

**Tengu Gale Blade:** This fan-shaped sword designed by tengu smiths has five broad blades that join at its hilt. Tengu sailors use them as makeshift weather vanes, for the sword spins in the wind's direction when loosely held aloft.

**Thunder Sling:** Tengu use these specialized slings to fire darts further and with greater force than when thrown by hand. A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also hurl blowgun darts as ammunition but deals 1d4 piercing damage instead of 1d6 when used this way.

**Tricky Pick:** This ingenious kobold pick conceals several hidden traps that the wielder can activate to trick and befuddle foes with a variety of damaging blades and bludgeoning surfaces.

**Whip Claw:** The whip claw is a long tether affixed to claw-like daggers, allowing the wielder to fling and retract them with deadly precision. Catfolk first developed this weapon to provide extended reach when hunting dangerous animals, and they wield them with unmatched expertise.

## Precious Materials

Materials with the precious trait can be substituted for base materials. Items made of a precious material cost more than typical items; not only does precious material cost more, but the crafter must invest more time working with it. In addition, more powerful items require precious materials of greater purity. Many precious materials and the process for crafting with them are described starting on page 252 of GM Core. A new precious material, dragonhide, is described below. The Price entry gives the price of a simple non-magical item made of that material, based on its Bulk (if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk, use the price for 1 Bulk) as well as prices for different amounts of the material. Armor and shields made of dragonhide are included here.

### Dragonhide · Material 8+

**Traits:** Uncommon, Precious

The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in color and texture, depending on the dragon it came from. Due to dragonhide's resiliency, it can also be used to Craft armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the tradition associated with the dragon (see the table below).

| Type | Level | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Standard-grade dragonhide object | 8 | 350 gp per Bulk |
| High-grade dragonhide object | 16 | 6,000 gp per Bulk |

| Dragon Tradition | Damage Immunity |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Arcane | Force |
| Divine | Spirit |
| Occult | Mental |
| Primal | Poison |

### Dragonhide Items

| Items | Hardness | HP | BT |
|-------|----------|----|----|
| **Thin Items** | | | |
| Standard-grade | 4 | 16 | 8 |
| High-grade | 8 | 32 | 16 |
| **Standard Items** | | | |
| Standard-grade | 7 | 28 | 14 |
| High-grade | 11 | 44 | 22 |

### Precious Material Armor

You can make leather, hide, or any armor usually made out of plates (such as breastplate, half plate, and full plate) from dragonhide. Because armor's Bulk is reduced when the armor is worn, use its carried Bulk when determining its material Price.

### Dragonhide Armor · Item 12+

**Traits:** Uncommon

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

Dragonhide armor is immune to one damage type based on the type of dragon it's made from (as listed in the table above). Wearing armor made from dragonhide also grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC and saving throws against attacks and spells that deal the corresponding damage type.

| Type | Level | Price | Craft Requirements |
|------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Standard-grade dragonhide armor | 12 | 1,600 gp + 160 gp per Bulk | The initial raw materials must include dragonhide worth at least 200 gp + 20 gp per Bulk. |
| High-grade dragonhide armor | 19 | 32,000 gp + 3,200 gp per Bulk | The initial raw materials must include dragonhide worth at least 16,000 gp + 1,600 gp per Bulk. |

### Precious Material Shields

You can make bucklers and most shields (except tower shields) out of dragonhide.

### Dragonhide Shield · Item 8+

**Traits:** Uncommon

**Usage** varies by shield

Dragonhide shields are each immune to one damage type based on the tradition associated with the dragon (see the table on page 276).

| Type | Level | Price | Bulk | Hardness | HP | BT | Craft Requirements |
|------|-------|-------|------|----------|----|----|-------------------|
| Standard-grade dragonhide buckler | 8 | 400 gp | L | 2 | 8 | 4 | dragonhide worth at least 50 gp |
