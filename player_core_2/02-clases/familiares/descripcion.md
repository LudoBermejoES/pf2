## New Familiar Abilities

### Item Delivery

If your familiar is adjacent to you, you can Command it to deliver an item. Instead of its normal 2 actions, your familiar Interacts to take an item you're holding of light Bulk or less, then takes one move action, then finally Interacts to pass off the item to another willing creature. It can instead administer the item to the creature if it can do so with 1 action and has an appropriate type of item (such as alchemical elixir). If your familiar doesn't reach the target this turn, it holds the item until commanded otherwise.

**Prerequisite:** Your familiar must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.

### Poison Reservoir

Your familiar has a reservoir for poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison to an adjacent ally's exposed weapon with a single Interact action. You must supply the poison and instill it into this reservoir using two consecutive Interact actions.

**Prerequisite:** You must have a homunculus familiar to select this ability.

### Second Opinion

Your familiar is your academic confidant. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to Aid you on a Recall Knowledge skill check for a skill in which it has the skilled familiar ability (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question.

**Prerequisite:** Your familiar must have the skilled ability to select this.

## New Master Abilities

### Extra Alchemy

Your familiar helps you brew items at the start of the day. You can create one additional item with advanced alchemy during your daily preparations.

**Prerequisite:** You must have the advanced alchemy ability to select this ability.

### Extra Vial

Your familiar accretes alchemical liquids in its body. Once per day, you can Interact when your familiar is adjacent to you to gain a versatile vial.

**Prerequisite:** You must have the versatile vials ability to select this ability.

## Specific Familiars

Some familiars are more powerful than the usual familiars, and possess unique abilities. Any character can gain a specific familiar so long as they already have a familiar with at least the required number of abilities listed in the specific familiar's stat block.

Such a familiar usually replaces an existing familiar, though in some circumstances (such as for a witch) the familiar may evolve or reveal its true form. This transition from a normal familiar to a specific familiar requires no downtime and has no cost. Once you've selected a specific familiar, you can't change it without losing your familiar—this uses the same rules for gaining a new pet.

A specific familiar has several traits and abilities, as listed in their stat block. The granted abilities entry lists normal familiar and master abilities that familiar has. The familiar also gains unique abilities listed below the granted abilities entry. Much like a familiar that naturally has a familiar ability (such as an owl with a fly Speed), you can never swap out any of these granted or unique abilities.

Statistics and abilities not listed in a specific familiar's stat block (such as modifiers, AC, Hit Points, and so forth) use the normal familiar rules.

An aeon wyrd is a floating swarm of gemstones surrounding a larger stone. It grants the power of its internal aeon stone to its master.

**Aeon Stone Reservoir:** Your aeon wyrd can house any aeon stone as a powerfully resonant nucleus that holds it together. You gain the aeon stone's benefits without needing to invest it, and you gain the aeon stone's resonant power. This doesn't interfere with any wayfinder you invest.

**Can't Walk:** Your aeon wyrd has no land Speed.

**Crystalline:** Your aeon wyrd's crystalline structure makes it vulnerable to sonic attacks. It gains weakness to sonic equal to your level.

### Fey Dragonet

### Homunculus

Homunculi are tiny servitor constructs created by a crafter to serve as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. A homunculus is crafted using a drop of its creator's blood in addition to any other components used in crafting its body.

**Traits:** Construct

**Required Number of Abilities:** 6

**Granted Abilities:** construct, darkvision, manual dexterity, poison reservoir

**Porter:** You can choose for your homunculus to have either item delivery or valet.

**Blood Link (Mental):** A homunculus is telepathically linked to its creator using their shared blood as a conduit, allowing it to share information back and forth at a range of 1,500 feet, including its master's knowledge and everything the homunculus hears. If you become unconscious and dying, your homunculus senses the waning power in your blood, allowing it to automatically act on the next turn as if you Commanded it. If the homunculus is destroyed, the master takes 2d10 mental damage.

### Imp

Imp familiars pretend to be subservient in order to trick their master into losing their soul or finding an early grave.

**Traits:** Fiend, Unholy

**Required Number of Abilities:** 7

**Granted Abilities:** darkvision, flier, manual dexterity, resistance (poison), skilled (Deception), speech, touch telepathy

**Imp Invisibility:** Once per hour, your imp familiar can cast invisibility on itself as a divine innate spell.

**Fiendish Temptation · ◆**

**Traits:** Concentrate, Divine, Fortune, Unholy

**Frequency:** once per day

The imp offers a non-fiend within 15 feet a bargain, granting a boon of good luck if the creature accepts. The boon lasts for 1 hour once accepted. Once during the hour, the creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and use the higher result. If the creature dies while the boon is in place, the imp decides where the creature's soul travels. This typically makes the soul bound for eternity in the imp's home plane, and the creature is unable to be raised or resurrected except by the wish ritual or similar magic.

### Pipefox

**Traits:** Beast

**Required Number of Abilities:** 5

**Granted Abilities:** climber, darkvision, second opinion, skilled (one skill of your choice), speech

**Scholarly Linguist:** Thanks to its innate erudition, your pipefox speaks and understands all languages you know (instead of just one) as well as one common language you don't know.

### Poppet

Endlessly modifiable, poppet familiars made of wood and wicker are among the most basic construct familiars available.

**Traits:** Construct

**Required Number of Abilities:** 1

**Ooze Defense:** Your spellslime familiar is easy to hit, but it lacks weak points. It is immune to critical hits and precision damage, but its AC is only 10 + your level (instead of an AC equal to yours).

**Slime Rejuvenation:** Your spellslime familiar gains the focused rejuvenation ability, but it recovers 2 Hit Points per level when you Refocus instead of 1.
