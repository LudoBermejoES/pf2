# Oracle

Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and servitude—you instead glean sacred truths and great mysteries embodied in overarching concepts, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as punishment from the gods.

## Statistics

## During Encounters

- **Combat:** You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body.
- **Social:** You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.
- **Exploration:** You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later.
- **Downtime:** You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power.

## You Might...

- View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.
- Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic.
- Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.

## Others Probably...

- Don't realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.
- Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods.
- Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts.

## Class Features

### Oracle Spellcasting

You have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this power spill forth in the form of divine magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity.

Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature.

### Spell Repertoire

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the divine list or from other divine spells to which you have access.

### Mystery

An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power.

Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power.

### Revelation Spells

Revelation spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.

### Oracular Curse

As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse.

Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1. At lower levels, your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4.

You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point.
