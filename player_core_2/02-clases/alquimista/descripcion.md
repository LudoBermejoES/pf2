# Alchemist

There's no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.

- **Downtime:** You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.

## You Might...

- Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.

- Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.

## Others Probably...

- Think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception.

- Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create.

During your daily preparations, you can create alchemical items without a Crafting check. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier.
