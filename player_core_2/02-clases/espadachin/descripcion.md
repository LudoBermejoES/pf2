# Swashbuckler

Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons. For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.

## Class Features

### Panache

You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.

You gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. Tumble Through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style gain the bravado trait when you use them. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.

Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.

### Precise Strike

When you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.

As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6.

### Stylish Combatant

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds.

### Confident Finisher · ◆

**Traits:** Finisher, Swashbuckler

You make an incredibly graceful attack, piercing your foe's defenses. Make a Strike with the following failure effect.

**Failure:** You deal half your precise strike damage to the target. This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you used for the Strike.

## Opportune Riposte · ◇ (3rd)

**Traits:** Bravado, Swashbuckler

**Trigger:** An enemy within your reach critically fails on a Strike against you.

You take advantage of an opening from your enemy's fumbled attack. You either make a melee Strike against the triggering enemy or attempt to Disarm it of the weapon it used for the Strike.

---

## Key Terms

**Bravado:** Actions with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved. If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn.

**Finisher:** Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. Finishers can be used only with weapons that deal additional damage with precise strike (agile or finesse melee weapons or unarmed attacks). You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.

**Flourish:** Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.

**Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again.
