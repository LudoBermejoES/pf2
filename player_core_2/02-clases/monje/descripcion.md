## Key Terms

**Flourish:** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Incapacitation:** An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws by one step.

**Qi Spells:** By tapping into an inner reserve of energy, called qi, you can cast special spells called qi spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first qi spell, you decide whether your qi spells are divine or occult spells, and you become trained in spell attack modifiers and spell DCs; your key spellcasting attribute is Wisdom.

**Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again.

**Venomous:** These weapons inject poison into every hit. When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an additional 1 persistent poison damage. This increases to 2 persistent poison damage if the weapon has a greater striking rune.
