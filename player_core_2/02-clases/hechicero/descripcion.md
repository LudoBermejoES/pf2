# Sorcerer

You didn't choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There's magic in your blood. Perhaps a divine influence blessed one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with an ancient, primordial entity, or a powerful occult ritual performed long ago influenced your lineage. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.

## Statistics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Hit Points** | 6 plus your Constitution modifier |
| **Key Attribute** | Charisma |

## Initial Proficiencies

| Category | Proficiency |
|----------|-------------|
| **Perception** | Trained |
| **Fortitude** | Trained |
| **Reflex** | Trained |
| **Will** | Expert |
| **Skills** | Trained in two skills determined by your bloodline, plus a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier |
| **Attacks** | Trained in simple weapons and unarmed attacks |
| **Defenses** | Untrained in all armor, Trained in unarmored defense |
| **Spells** | Trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC |
| **Class DC** | Trained in sorcerer class DC |

## During Encounters

- **Combat:** You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl.
- **Social:** Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.
- **Exploration:** You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your party of magical traps.
- **Downtime:** You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.

## You Might...

- Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.
- View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between.
- Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells.

## Others Probably...

- Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.
- Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other disciplined practitioners of magic.
- Assume you're as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.

### Sorcerer Spellcasting

Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline.
