### Shields of the Spirit · ◆ · Focus 1

**Traits:** Uncommon, Champion, Concentrate, Focus, Sanctified, Spirit

**Requirements:** You are wielding a shield.

You Raise your Shield, causing ephemeral spirit shields to float within your champion's aura. The shields last until the start of your next turn or until you're no longer raising your shield, whichever comes first. While one of your allies is in your champion's aura, the shields grant them a +1 status bonus to AC, and each time an enemy makes an attack against the ally, the enemy takes 1d4 spirit damage (even if it misses).

The benefit applies only while an ally is in your aura, ending for any ally that leaves and applying to any that enters later. As normal, you don't count as your own ally and therefore don't get the benefits of the spirit shields yourself.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4.

## Additional Devotion Spells

### Champion's Sacrifice · ◇ · Focus 6

**Traits:** Uncommon, Champion, Focus, Manipulate

**Trigger:** An ally is hit by a Strike or fails a saving throw against an effect that doesn't affect you.

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** the triggering ally

You form a link with an ally, allowing you to take harm in their stead. All the effects of the hit or failed save are applied to you instead of the target. For example, if the target critically fails a saving throw against a fireball, you would take double damage. These effects ignore any resistances, immunities, or other abilities you have that might mitigate them in any way, although those of the target apply before you take the effect.

### Hero's Defiance · ◇ · Focus 10

**Traits:** Uncommon, Champion, Concentrate, Focus, Healing, Vitality

**Trigger:** An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.

You shout in defiance and are filled with a burst of healing. Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover 6d8+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become unconscious or dying. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use hero's defiance again until you Refocus or make your daily preparations. Hero's defiance can't be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as disintegrate.

### Spectral Advance · ◆ or ◆◆ · Focus 5

**Traits:** Uncommon, Champion, Concentrate, Focus, Polymorph, Spirit

Taking on a spiritual form, you flash across the battlefield to engage an enemy. You Stride to a space adjacent to an enemy. If you cast the spell using 2 actions, you can Stride twice instead of once. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly instead of Striding. If you're mounted, you can have your mount move instead of you.

Movement from spectral advance doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain. During the movement, you (or your mount) have resistance equal to your level to all damage.
