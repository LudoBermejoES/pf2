## Ghostly Tragedy · Spell 4

**Traits:** Uncommon, Concentrate, Manipulate, Spirit

**Traditions:** divine, occult

**Cast:** 1 minute

**Area:** 60-foot emanation

**Duration:** 10 minutes

This spell compels local spirits to reenact a violent event of the recent past that you're aware of and name as you Cast the Spell. You take the role of the primary victim. The reenactment plays out the final 9 minutes leading up to the death or injury of the victim and the minute after. The spirits don't change form, so this doesn't help determine perpetrators by their looks. Spiritual forms of missing creatures necessary for the event manifest as needed, and missing items appear as shadowy outlines.

Once the scene ends, you take 2d6 void damage for each ghostly apparition that participated in the scene (typically equal to the number of creatures involved other than the victim). Any creature that observed the ghostly recreation, including you, can attempt checks to investigate the event to discover new clues and information.

## Ghoulish Cravings · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Curse, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** divine, occult

**Range:** touch; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** varies

You touch the target to afflict it with the overwhelming desire to eat raw meat. The target must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is sickened 1 by its unbidden hunger.

**Failure** The target is sickened 2 and can't reduce this condition below sickened 1 until it first consumes some raw meat; if the creature doesn't have access to raw meat, it can take a bite out of a corpse within reach as an Interact action.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target can't reduce the condition below sickened 2 until it consumes raw meat.

---

## Gravity Well · ◆◆ · Spell 3

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Range:** 120 feet; **Area:** 30-foot burst

**Defense:** Reflex

You create a sphere of altered gravity. All creatures and unsecured objects in the area move toward the center, depending on their Reflex saving throws. This follows the rules for forced movement. If there's not enough space near the center of the sphere, creatures and objects nearer to the center move first, and others move as far as they can without being blocked, up to the amount set by their saving throw outcomes.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature moves 5 feet toward the center.

**Failure** The creature moves 15 feet toward the center.

**Critical Failure** The creature moves 30 feet toward the center.

---

## Grisly Growths · ◆◆ · Spell 5

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 60 feet; **Targets:** 1 corporeal creature

**Defense:** basic Fortitude

This gruesome spell causes the target to grow excess limbs and organs, whether it be fingers multiplying until hands resemble bushes, eyes popping open in bizarre places, legs sprouting from the side of the body, or some other result. The target takes 10d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away after 1 round.

In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds, creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must attempt Will saves, after which they're temporarily immune to this secondary effect of grisly growths for 1 hour. This additional effect is a mental and visual effect.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is sickened 1.

**Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 2.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.

---

## Haunting Hymn · ◆◆ · Cantrip 1

**Traits:** Auditory, Cantrip, Concentrate, Manipulate, Sonic

**Traditions:** divine, occult

**Area:** 15-foot cone

**Defense:** basic Fortitude

You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear. The hymn deals 1d8 sonic damage, with a basic Fortitude save. If a target critically fails the save, it's also deafened for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.

---

## Holy Cascade · ◆◆ · Spell 4

**Traits:** Concentrate, Holy, Manipulate, Water

**Traditions:** divine

**Cost:** one vial of holy water (Pathfinder GM Core 268)

**Range:** 500 feet; **Area:** 20-foot burst

**Defense:** basic Reflex

You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of holy water, tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional 6d6 spirit damage to creatures with the unholy trait in the area.

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, and the additional spirit damage increases by 2d6.

---

## Ice Storm · ◆◆◆ · Spell 4

**Traits:** Cold, Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 120 feet; **Area:** 20-foot burst

**Defense:** basic Reflex; **Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder of the spell's duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two nonoverlapping clouds instead of one. As normal, if a Large or larger creature is in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the continuing damage once per turn.

**Heightened (+2)** The initial bludgeoning damage and cold damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 1.

---

## Imaginary Lockbox · Spell 5

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Cast:** 1 minute

**Range:** touch; **Targets:** 1 container and its contents, totaling 10 Bulk or less

**Duration:** until the next time you make your daily preparations

You turn a container and its contents into an imaginary form stored in your mind that only you can see and interact with. The container's physical properties—the material from which it's made, any locks, or other features—are irrelevant to the casting of this spell, but the container can't contain any creatures. The container has no Bulk, and you can visualize everything inside it.

You can retrieve an item from the lockbox as an activity that takes 3 actions and has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Putting items back isn't possible. You can Dismiss the spell. When the spell ends, the container returns to its normal state, either appearing in your hands if it can fit there or on the ground adjacent to you if not.

---

## Imprint Message · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** occult

**Range:** touch; **Targets:** 1 object

You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts object reading on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a retrocognition spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.

If the object is targeted with read aura of a higher spell rank than imprint message, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you Cast this Spell, any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of imprint message fade.

---

## Invisible Item · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Range:** touch; **Targets:** 1 object

**Duration:** 1 hour

You make the object invisible. This makes it undetected to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it hidden to them instead if they succeed. If the item is used as part of a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed. Making a weapon invisible typically doesn't give any advantage to the attack, except that an invisible thrown weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack without necessarily giving information about the attacker's hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.

**Heightened (3rd)** The duration is until the next time you make your daily preparations.

**Heightened (7th)** The duration is unlimited.

---

## Leaden Steps · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Metal, Morph

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Fortitude; **Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

You partially transform a foe's feet into unwieldy slabs of metal, slowing their steps. The target attempts a Fortitude saving throw.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is encumbered and has weakness 2 to electricity until the end of your next turn. The spell can't be sustained.

**Failure** The target is encumbered and has weakness 2 to electricity.

**Critical Failure** The target is encumbered and has weakness 3 to electricity.

**Heightened (+1)** The weakness increases by 1.

---

## Lifewood Cage · ◆◆◆ · Spell 7

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Vitality, Wood

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 30 feet; **Area:** 1 cube 20 feet on each side

**Defense:** Reflex; **Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

You create an immobile, invisible prison of hardened wood suffused with vital energy from the Forge of Creation. The cage is a 20-foot cube made of wooden branches, each a half inch thick and a half inch apart. Each creature in the area where you create the cage must attempt a Reflex save. If such a creature fails, it becomes trapped inside the cage. If it succeeds, it's pushed outside the cage into a space of its choice. If a creature in the area is too big to fit inside the prison, the spell automatically fails.

The cage has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage, though it has weakness 5 to void damage. A creature capable of passing through the space between the bars (typically a Tiny creature) can leave; all others are confined within. The vitality energy suffusing the wood prevents incorporeal undead creatures from passing through the beams. Attacks with a weapon too large to fit between the bars can't pass through the cage, and the bars provide standard cover even against attacks that can pass through the gaps. Spells and most area effects (such as dragon breath) can pass through the cage uninhibited.

## Lightning Storm · ◆◆◆ · Spell 5

**Traits:** Concentrate, Electricity, Manipulate

**Traditions:** primal

**Range:** 120 feet; **Area:** 20-foot burst

**Defense:** basic Reflex; **Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one lightning bolt within the spell's area. The bolt is a vertical line from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two nonoverlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call down only one bolt per turn.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.

---

## Live Wire · ◆◆ · Cantrip 1

**Traits:** Attack, Cantrip, Concentrate, Electricity, Manipulate, Metal

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** AC

You conjure up a length of sharp copper filament humming with electrical current that strikes out at your foe. The wire deals 1d4 slashing damage and 1d4 electricity damage, depending on your spell attack roll against the target's AC.

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent electricity damage.

**Success** The target takes full damage.

**Failure** The target takes the electricity damage, but not the slashing damage.

**Critical Failure** The target is unaffected.

**Heightened (+1)** The slashing damage, initial electricity damage, and persistent electricity damage on a critical hit each increase by 1d4.

## Mud Pit · ◆◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 60 feet; **Area:** squares on the ground in a 15-foot burst

**Duration:** 1 minute

Thick, clinging mud covers the ground, 1 foot deep. The mud is difficult terrain.

## Nature's Enmity · ◆◆ · Spell 9

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Plant, Wood

**Traditions:** primal

**Range:** 120 feet; **Area:** 500-foot burst; **Targets:** up to 5 creatures

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it remains in the area.

- Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any time it's adjacent to the plants and fungi.
- Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it's attacked by creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic Reflex save and is off-guard for 1 round on any outcome other than a critical success.
- The target loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. The target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such as an animal companion.

The GM might decide that you can't subject some creatures, such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.

---

## Noxious Vapors · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Poison

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Area:** 10-foot emanation

**Defense:** basic Fortitude; **Duration:** 1 round

You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes sickened 1. All creatures in the area become concealed, and all creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.

---

## Object Reading · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** occult

**Range:** touch; **Targets:** 1 object

You place a hand on an object to learn a piece of information about an emotional event that occurred involving the object within the past week, determined by the GM. If you cast object reading on the same item multiple times, you can either concentrate on a single event to gain additional pieces of information about that event or gain a piece of information about another emotional event in the applicable time frame.

**Heightened (2nd)** You can learn about an event that occurred within the last month.

**Heightened (4th)** You can learn about an event that occurred within the last year.

## Phantasmal Treasure · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Emotion, Illusion, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Range:** 60 feet; **Targets:** 1 living creature

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** varies

A phantasmal image of the most precious thing imaginable to the target appears in a location of your choice within the spell's range. Only the spell's target can see the treasure, though you can see the vague shape of the treasure—be it a pile of items, a deific avatar, or a cherished loved one or hero. The target's response to the treasure is based on the outcome of the target's Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target becomes fascinated with the treasure, and the duration is until the end of its turn. The target can also try to disbelieve the illusion if it touches the treasure, Seeks to examine it, or speaks to it if the illusion appears to be a person or the like. If the target disbelieves the illusion, the spell ends.

**Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell ends, it must spend each action focused on it. This can include moving toward the treasure if the target isn't next to it and Interacting with the treasure if the target is next to it. (If the illusion appears to be a person or the like, the target can also Interact to converse with it.)

## Primal Herd · ◆◆ · Spell 10

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Polymorph

**Traditions:** primal

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** you and up to 5 willing targets

**Duration:** 1 minute

Summoning the power of the natural world, you transform the targets into a herd of mammoths, and they each assume a Huge battle form. Each target must have enough space to expand into or the spell fails for that target. Each target gains the animal trait. Each target can Dismiss the spell's effects on itself. Each target gains the following while transformed.

- AC = 22 + the target's level. Ignore any armor check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 20 temporary Hit Points.
- Speed 40 feet.
- Low-light vision.
- The following unarmed melee attacks, which are the only attacks the target can use to Strike. When Striking with these attacks, the target uses their attack modifier with the proficiency and item bonuses of their most favorable weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage is listed for each attack. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). Melee ◆ tusk (reach 15 feet), Damage 4d8+19 piercing; Melee ◆ trunk (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 4d6+16 bludgeoning; Melee ◆ foot (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 4d6+13 bludgeoning.

- Each target can use the Trample action.

---

## Protector Tree · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Plant, Wood

**Traditions:** primal

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** 1 minute

A Medium tree suddenly grows in an unoccupied square within range. The tree has AC 10 and 10 Hit Points. Whenever an ally adjacent to the tree is hit by a Strike, the tree interposes its branches and takes the damage first. Any additional damage beyond what it takes to reduce the tree to 0 Hit Points is dealt to the original target. The tree isn't large enough to impede movement through its square.

If the tree is in soil and survives to the end of the spell's duration, it remains as an ordinary, non-magical tree and continues to grow and thrive. The GM might determine that the tree disappears immediately in certain inhospitable situations.

**Heightened (+1)** The tree has an additional 10 Hit Points.

---
