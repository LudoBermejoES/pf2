## Telepathic Demand · ◆◆◆ · Spell 9

**Traits:** Concentrate, Incapacitation, Linguistic, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** planetary; **Targets:** 1 creature you've telepathically contacted before

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** varies

You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of a suggestion spell, with the message substituting for the spoken suggestion. On a successful save, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the target is temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a creature only if you've previously been in telepathic contact with it before, such as via the telepathy spell.

## Thoughtful Gift · ◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Manipulate, Teleportation

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** 120 feet; **Targets:** 1 willing creature

You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target's hand if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don't. The target knows what object you're attempting to send them. If the target is unconscious or refuses to accept your gift, or if the spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an extradimensional container), the spell fails.

**Heightened (3rd)** The spell's range increases to 500 feet.

**Heightened (5th)** As 3rd level, and the object's maximum Bulk increases to 1. You can Cast the Spell with 3 actions instead of 1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile, and you don't need line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar with the target.

## Threefold Aspect · Spell 3

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Polymorph

**Traditions:** occult, primal

**Cast:** 1 minute

**Duration:** until the next time you make your daily preparations

This spell allows you to change between three versions of yourself of different ages: a maiden (young adult), a mother (adult), or a matriarch (elderly). Choose one when you Cast the Spell. While the spell lasts, you can change the age to any of the three or to your natural age by Sustaining the spell. Your form always looks like you regardless of the age, and creatures who know you still recognize you and can tell your age is different.

Threefold aspect alters your physical appearance and personality to present an authentic version of yourself at various ages. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you're untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn't get a chance to notice that you aren't at your true age. You can Dismiss this spell.

## Vampiric Maiden · ◆◆ · Spell 4

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Void

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Fortitude

A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the void damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage.

**Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is immobilized by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing and void damage increase by 1d4 each.

## Visions of Danger · ◆◆◆ · Spell 7

**Traits:** Auditory, Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate, Visual

**Traditions:** occult

**Range:** 500 feet; **Area:** 30-foot burst

**Defense:** basic Will; **Duration:** 1 minute

An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell's area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of your choice, such as fiendish flies or animated saw blades. The burst deals 8d8 mental damage with a basic Will save to each creature that's inside the burst when it's created, enters the burst, or starts its turn inside the burst. A creature that critically succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to disbelieve the illusion. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage from the illusion thereafter.

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d8.

## Vomit Swarm · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, occult, primal

**Area:** 30-foot cone

**Defense:** basic Reflex

You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn't change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage (basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes sickened 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8.

## Wall of Flesh · ◆◆ · Spell 5

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** divine, occult, primal

**Range:** 60 feet

**Duration:** 1 minute

You craft a 20-foot-tall wall of living flesh in a straight line up to 30 feet long. The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section has AC 10 and 75 Hit Points. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length or height. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall can't be Repaired but can be healed by vitality, and healing spells and abilities.

When you Cast the Spell, choose one of the following features for your wall.

**Mouths:** The wall has countless toothy mouths along its surface. The mouths Strike any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack modifier for these Strikes and dealing 2d6 piercing damage. The mouths are capable of consuming potions; since the wall is alive, it can recover Hit Points from a healing potion, but it can't benefit from any effect that would give it the ability to move. Otherwise, the GM determines which potions can affect the wall.

**Eyes:** The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to visual Perception checks within the wall's line of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line of sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don't have line of effect through the wall.

**Arms:** The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt a Reflex save.
- **Success** The creature is unaffected.
- **Failure** The creature is grabbed by the wall for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever comes first.
- **Critical Failure** The creature is restrained by the wall for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever comes first.

**Heightened (+2)** The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 10, and the piercing damage dealt by the wall's mouths increases by 1d6.

## Wanderer's Guide · Spell 3

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** divine, occult

**Cast:** 1 minute

**Duration:** until your next daily preparations

You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast this Spell, choose a destination; you receive an inspired route to that destination, allowing you and allies who travel overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don't deviate from the inspired route. This doesn't have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.

## Weapon of Judgment · ◆◆ · Spell 9

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Sanctified, Spirit

**Traditions:** divine

**Requirements:** You have a deity.

**Range:** 100 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Duration:** 1 minute

An immense weapon of spiritual energy appears, hovering in the air above the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of your deity's favored weapon. Name war or peace when you cast this spell.

If you name "war," mentally choose one creature. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target's turns, if the target didn't use a hostile action against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target.

If you name "peace," mentally choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against you or one of the chosen allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike).

Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals 4d10 damage. The damage type is the same as the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon). The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target's turn, but its penalty is separate from yours.

A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons don't apply to this weapon.

**Heightened (10th)** The damage increases by 1d10.

## Web · ◆◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** 30 feet; **Area:** 10-foot burst

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures' movement. Squares filled with the web are difficult terrain. Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or enters the web during a move action it's using, it must attempt an Athletics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid taking a circumstance penalty to its Speeds or becoming immobilized. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to take a circumstance penalty to its Speed from the web.

Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, and it doesn't need to attempt further Athletics checks or saving throws against the web this turn. If it used an Athletics check, it clears the web from every square it leaves during its movement.

**Success** The creature is unaffected during its action. If it used an Athletics check, it clears the web from every square it leaves during its movement.

**Failure** The creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the start of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature is immobilized until the start of its next turn, after which it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. It can attempt to Escape to remove its immobilized condition.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell's area increases to a 20-foot burst, and its range increases to 60 feet.

## Whispers of the Void · ◆◆ · Spell 4

**Traits:** Auditory, Concentrate, Manipulate, Void

**Traditions:** divine, occult

**Range:** 60 feet; **Area:** 10-foot burst

**Defense:** Fortitude

You whisper baleful secrets that transcend language and carry magically to the ears of your foes. The words take physical form, weakening the life force of the targets, each of which must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 2d8 persistent void damage.

**Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage and becomes drained 1.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage and becomes drained 2 and doomed 1.

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent void damage increases by 1d8 on a success, or by 2d8 on a failure or critical failure.
