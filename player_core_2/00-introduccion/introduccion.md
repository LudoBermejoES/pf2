# Introduction

Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. This book combines with Player Core, expanding on its options and giving you even more ways to play the character you want!

## More of Everything

Player Core 2 provides even more options for player characters. Along with the ancestries and classes summarized on the following page, there are additional general and skill feats, equipment, spells, and treasure round out your characters' abilities.

Alongside the eight new multiclass archetypes for the classes in this book, you can find archetypes for all sorts of characters starting on page 172. These can expand any Pathfinder character in unexpected directions, helping them discover new abilities to match their developing stories.

Many of these archetypes support combat specializations, like the bastion and wrestler, while others show off the roles characters may be stepping into, like the blessed one and marshal. Even characters' growing skills can uncover deeper specializations, like the archaeologist and medic.

In addition to an expansive slate of ancestries, this book also contains three versatile heritages suitable for characters of any ancestry:

- **Dhampirs** are the mortal offspring of vampires, walking the line between life and undeath.
- **Dragonbloods** possess obvious draconic traits owing to dragons' influence, either direct or on their ancestors.
- **Duskwalkers** are souls reincarnated as a result of a bargain between psychopomps, the guides of the dead.

## How to Use This Book

The new options in this book expand on those in Player Core, and that book is required to use Player Core 2. It's easy to dive in using an ancestry, class, and archetype from this book, but endless variations come to life when combining these with options from Player Core and other sources.

If you're creating a new character, you're probably interested in the new ancestries (page 7), classes (page 54), and backgrounds (page 50).

Even characters you've already created can benefit from archetypes (page 172), along with new options for feats (page 224), spells (page 236), and items (page 272).

## Uncommon Ancestries and Heritages

Each new ancestry in this book is uncommon. Though uncommon elements of the game are usually acquired during play, you choose your ancestry and heritage at the beginning of the game. This means you should talk to your group and GM about which uncommon ancestries and heritages make sense for the story.

In the pirate-laden Shackles, tengu are a regular sight. But they're even more common in the eastern continent of Tian Xia, where halflings and dwarves are uncommon! Even if your chosen ancestry isn't particularly common in the area where the story takes place, most times you can work with your GM and the other players to find a great way to incorporate that character into the narrative.

This discussion might point toward ways an uncommon ancestry might figure into the game and set the stage for how they interact with the other characters. In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the accompanying player's guide might include information about which ancestries are particularly appropriate for the campaign.
