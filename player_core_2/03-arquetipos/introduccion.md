# Chapter 3: Archetypes

Beyond your class and general feats, you can expand your character concept by choosing an archetype. Are you more heavily armored than your peers because of the sentinel archetype? Are you a viking, experienced in seafaring and raiding? Perhaps you're a medic, tending to the fallen. These are just a few possibilities archetypes offer.

## Gaining an Archetype

You gain an archetype by selecting archetype feats instead of your normal feats. First, find the archetype that best fits your character concept. Then select that archetype's dedication feat, using one of your class feat choices. Once you've taken the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that archetype, as long as you meet its prerequisites.

Most archetype feats are taken in place of class feats, and so these are called archetype class feats.

An archetype feat is subject to any restrictions on the class feat it replaces. For example, if you had an ability at 6th level that granted you a bonus class feat, but that class feat had to be 4th level or lower and have the dwarf trait, you could use that class feat to take an archetype class feat, but only one of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait.

## Dedication Details

Each archetype's dedication feat represents your character's effort to learn a new set of abilities, making it impossible to split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same time. Once you take a dedication feat, you can't select a different dedication feat until you complete your dedication by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You can't retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.

## Multiclass Dedications

Some archetypes have the multiclass trait. These allow you to diversify your training into another class's specialties. You can't select a multiclass archetype's dedication feat if you are already a member of that class.

## Additional Feats

Some archetypes include a list of "Additional Feats" that appear in other sources. The list includes each feat's level, which might be different than normal when gained from the archetype. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype's dedication feat.

## Feats that Grant Feats

Sometimes an archetype feat lets you select another feat, such as a class feat of a lower level. You must always meet any prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way. These always count as only one feat for the purposes of your dedication.

## Spellcasting Archetypes

Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character from a spellcasting class. A spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a spellcasting class can.

Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master spellcasting feat.

**Basic Spellcasting Feat:** Usually available at 4th level, these feats grant a 1st-rank spell slot. At 6th level, they grant you a 2nd-rank spell slot, and if you have a spell repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd-rank spell slot.

**Expert Spellcasting Feat:** Typically taken at 12th level, these feats make you an expert in spell attack modifier and spell DC and grant you a 4th-rank spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-rank spell slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-rank spell slot.

**Master Spellcasting Feat:** Usually found at 18th level, these feats make you a master in spell attack modifier and spell DC and grant you a 7th-rank spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a signature spell. At 20th level, they grant you an 8th-rank spell slot.

## Alchemical Archetypes

Some archetypes give you the ability to use alchemy in a similar manner to an alchemist and say that you get the advanced alchemy benefits or Quick Alchemy benefits.

**Advanced Alchemy Benefits:** You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat if you don't already have it. In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows you to create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables each day during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure.

**Quick Alchemy Benefits:** You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat if you don't already have it. In addition, you gain the Quick Alchemy action, which lets you create short-lived alchemical consumables with a special action, and you can create a certain number of versatile vials during your daily preparations to fuel Quick Alchemy.

---

## Temporary Items

Several archetypes allow you to prepare temporary items. Much like the infused items created by alchemists, these temporary items last only a short time before becoming useless. Temporary items are clearly not up to the same quality as other items, so they typically can't be sold. If an ability doesn't list how long a temporary item lasts, the item lasts until the next time you make your daily preparations.

---

## Special Archetypes

Some archetype feats have the skill trait, allowing you to take them in place of a skill feat rather than a class feat. A skill feat still counts to satisfy the requirement of the dedication.

---

## Key Terms

**Flourish:** Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.

**Spellshape:** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. You must use the spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter.

**Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance.
