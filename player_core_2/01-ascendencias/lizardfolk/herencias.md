# Heritages for Lizardfolk

While most lizardfolk prefer wetlands, eons of evolution and cultural adaptation enable them to live in more challenging environments. Choose one of the following lizardfolk heritages at 1st level.

---

## Cliffscale Lizardfolk

Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing.

**Benefit:** You gain the Combat Climber feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren't wearing footwear, you can use the sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.

## Cloudleaper Lizardfolk

Your body is light with flaps of skin along your limbs that catch the air that passes beneath you.

**Benefit:** As long as you can act and have enough room, you can open the flaps to slow any fall just enough to avoid taking damage (whether you have the room to do so depends on the GM's discretion).

## Frilled Lizardfolk

You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, Demoralizing your foes.

**Benefit:** When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the Threatening Approach action.

> **Threatening Approach** ◆◆
>
> You Stride to be adjacent to a foe and Demoralize that foe. If you succeed, the foe is frightened 2 instead of frightened 1.

## Sandstrider Lizardfolk

Your thick scales help you retain water and combat the sun's glare.

**Benefit:** You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). Environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you, and you can go 10 times as long as normal before you are affected by starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.

## Unseen Lizardfolk

You can change your skin color to blend in with your surroundings, making minor shifts with a single action and dramatic changes over the course of an hour.

**Benefit:** When you're in an area where your coloration is roughly similar to the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the minor, single-action application of this ability to make localized changes that help you blend into your surroundings, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks until your surroundings change in coloration or pattern.

## Wetlander Lizardfolk

Your family is descended from the most common lizardfolk heritage, and you are accustomed to aquatic environments.

**Benefit:** You gain a 15-foot swim Speed.

---

## Woodstalker Lizardfolk

You move easily through thick forest and jungle, using every branch or bush.

**Benefit:** You can always use the Take Cover action when in forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you would normally be able to Take Cover behind. You gain the Terrain Stalker feat, even if you're not trained in Stealth, and you must choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
