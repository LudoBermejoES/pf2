# Ancestry Feats for Lizardfolk

At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a lizardfolk, you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

---

## 1st Level

### Bone Magic · Feat 1

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

Your connection to your iruxi ancestors manifests as a simple primal spell that you cast using a fragment of an ancestor's bones. Choose one cantrip from either the occult spell list or the primal spell list. You can cast this cantrip as an innate spell at will, and it's heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.

**Special:** Choose when you gain this feat whether your innate spells are primal or occult; this choice applies to all innate spells you gain from lizardfolk ancestry feats that have Bone Magic as a prerequisite.

---

### Iruxi Armaments · Feat 1

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

Your weapons are those you were born with. Choose one of the following options:

- **Claws** Your claw attack deals 1d6 slashing damage instead of 1d4 and gains the versatile P trait.
- **Fangs** You gain a fangs unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and is in the brawling group.
- **Tail** You gain a tail unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, is in the brawling group, and has the sweep trait.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of the unarmed attacks you have gained or improved with this feat, you get its critical specialization effect.

**Special:** You can take this feat multiple times, choosing a different unarmed attack option each time.

### Lizardfolk Lore · Feat 1

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

You listened carefully to the tales passed down among your community. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Survival and either Nature or Occultism. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for either Astrology Lore or Lizardfolk Lore.

### Marsh Runner · Feat 1

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

**Prerequisites:** You have a swim Speed.

When you use the Step action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by flooding, swamps, or quicksand. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on narrow surfaces or uneven marshy ground, you aren't off-guard, and if you roll a success on the Acrobatics check, you get a critical success instead.

---

### Parthenogenic Hatchling · Feat 1

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

You were hatched from an unfertilized egg during hard times for your people, and are a biological copy of your mother. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease, you get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve the save in this way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

You take damage only every 2 hours from thirst and every 2 days from starvation, rather than every hour and every day.

**Special:** You can select this feat only at 1st level.

---

### Reptile Speaker · Feat 1

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

You hear the sounds of reptiles as language. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals that are reptiles (the GM determines which animals count as reptiles).

## 5th Level

### Envenom Fangs · Feat 5 · ◆

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

**Prerequisites:** Iruxi Armaments (Fangs)

**Frequency:** once per hour

You envenom your fangs. If the next fangs Strike you make before the end of your next turn hits and deals damage, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 persistent poison damage. The poison becomes inert after you hit, or at the end of your next turn, whichever comes first.

### Flexible Tail · Feat 5

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

You can perform simple Interact actions with your tail, such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.

---

### Gecko's Grip · Feat 5

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

You cling to walls with a preternatural grip. You gain the Combat Climber feat as a bonus feat, and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.

**Special:** If you have the cliffscale lizardfolk heritage, you instead gain a climb Speed of 15 feet.

### Shed Tail · Feat 5 · ◇

You can shed a portion of your tail to escape. You cease being grabbed, then Stride without triggering any reactions from the creature that grabbed you.

### Dangle · Feat 9

**Traits:** Lizardfolk

You can hang by your tail from any suitable anchor point, such as a tree branch, balcony, or rocky outcropping (subject to the GM's discretion), typically while climbing. While hanging, you have free use of all your other limbs, so you can perform tasks that require both hands, such as firing a bow or swinging a greatsword.

### Terrain Advantage · Feat 9

Non-lizardfolk creatures in difficult terrain are off-guard to you. If you have a swim Speed, non-lizardfolk creatures that are in water and lack a swim Speed are also off-guard to you.

### Scion Transformation · Feat 17

**Traits:** Lizardfolk, Primal

You go into hibernation for twenty-four hours and perform a ritual dedicated to your ancestors, undergoing a one-time metamorphosis. You permanently gain the effects of *enlarge*, and your maximum Hit Points increase by your level.
