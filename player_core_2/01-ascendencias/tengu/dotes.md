## 1st Level

### Mariner's Fire · Feat 1

You conjure uncanny orbs of spiritual flame that float above or below the water's surface.

---

### Squawk! · Feat 1 · ◇

**Traits:** Tengu

**Trigger:** You critically fail a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check against a creature that doesn't have the tengu trait.

You let out an awkward squawk, ruffle your feathers, or fake some other birdlike tic to cover up a social misstep or faux pas. You get a failure on the triggering check, rather than a critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are temporarily immune for 24 hours.

---

### Storm's Lash · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tengu

Wind and lightning have always been friends to you. You can cast the *electric arc* cantrip as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.

---

### Tengu Lore · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tengu

You learned skills for surviving in the place where your people were dispersed. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Society and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Tengu Lore.

---

### Tengu Weapon Familiarity · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tengu

You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the tengu trait plus the katana, khakkara, temple sword, and wakizashi. You have familiarity with these weapons—for the purpose of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.

During your daily preparations, you can practice with a weapon from the sword group that's in your possession. You gain familiarity with that weapon as well. This lasts until you practice with a different sword in the same way.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

---

### Uncanny Agility · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tengu

You have near-supernatural poise that lets you move swiftly across the most unsteady surfaces. You gain the Steady Balance skill feat. You can Step into difficult terrain caused by uneven ground, such as a rocky field, hilly incline, or rocking ship.

---

## 5th Level

### Eat Fortune · Feat 5 · ◇

**Traits:** Concentrate, Divine, Tengu

**Frequency:** once per day

**Trigger:** A creature within 60 feet uses a fortune or misfortune effect.

As someone tries to twist fate, you consume the interference. The triggering effect is disrupted. If it's a misfortune effect, Eat Fortune gains the fortune trait; if it's a fortune effect, Eat Fortune gains the misfortune trait. This fortune or misfortune applies to the same roll the triggering effect would have, so you couldn't negate a fortune effect with Eat Fortune and then apply a misfortune effect to the same roll.

---

### Long-Nosed Form · Feat 5 · ◆

**Traits:** Concentrate, Polymorph, Primal, Tengu

You transform into a specific, curious-looking human form. This human form is the same age and body type as your tengu form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as height, though your nose remains as long as your beak and your complexion has red undertones, no matter the skin color of your human form. Using Long-Nosed Form counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. Due to your imperfect transformation, your transformation doesn't automatically defeat Perception DCs to determine whether you are human, though you may be able to explain away or hide your tengu traits.

You lose your beak unarmed Strike in your human form, as well as any other unarmed Strikes you gained from a tengu heritage or ancestry feat. You remain in your human form indefinitely, until you Dismiss this effect.

---

### Magpie Snatch · Feat 5 · ◆◆

**Traits:** Tengu

You move quickly, snatching a shiny item that catches your eye. Stride twice, and you can Interact to pick up an unattended object at any point during your movement.

---

### Soaring Flight · Feat 5 · ◆

**Traits:** Tengu

**Prerequisites:** skyborn tengu heritage

**Frequency:** once per round

You Fly. If you don't normally have a fly Speed, you gain a fly Speed of 20 feet for this movement. If you aren't on solid ground at the end of this movement, you fall.

---

### Tengu Feather Fan · Feat 5 · ◆

**Traits:** Tengu

You've learned to bind some of your feathers together into a fan to focus your ancestral magic. You gain a tengu feather fan: a magic item of light Bulk with a level equal to your level and the primal trait. You (and only you) can cast tengu magic with the Wave Fan activation. If your fan is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers.

Your tengu feather fan contains a 1st-rank *gust of wind* spell. Further feats might add more spells and grant you additional activations of your tengu feather fan, but you can never have more than three activations per day, no matter how many such feats you have.

> **Activate—Wave Fan** (manipulate)
>
> **Frequency:** once per day
>
> You cast your choice of one spell contained in your tengu feather fan. You can instead cast a cantrip you've gained from a heritage or an ancestry feat; this doesn't use up one of the fan's daily activations.
>
> This activation takes the spell's normal number of actions. The spell's DC is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
