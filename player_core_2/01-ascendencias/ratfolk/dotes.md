# Ancestry Feats for Ratfolk

At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a ratfolk, you select from among the following ancestry feats.

---

## 1st Level

### Cheek Pouches · Feat 1

**Traits:** Ratfolk

Your cheeks are stretchy, and you can store up to four items of light Bulk or less in these cheek pouches. None of these items can have a dimension longer than 1 foot. As long as you have at least one item in your cheek pouches, your speech is noticeably difficult to understand. Placing an item in your cheek pouch or retrieving one is an Interact action. You can empty your mouth with a single action, causing everything you had stored in your cheek pouches to fall to the ground in your square.

### Pack Rat · Feat 1

**Traits:** Ratfolk

You've learned how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers or vehicles. For example, you can fit 6 Bulk in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn't alter the items' Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or extradimensional storage space, such as a spacious pouch.

### Rat Familiar · Feat 1

**Traits:** Ratfolk

You have a pet rat that has become magically bonded to you. You gain a familiar using the rules on page 212 of the Player Core, and this familiar must be a rat. It still gets the benefits of familiar abilities, but its base form remains a rat.

### Ratfolk Lore · Feat 1

**Traits:** Ratfolk

Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made you nimble, and you've learned to run and hide when enemies threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics and Stealth.

You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Ratfolk Lore.
