# Ancestry Feats for Hobgoblin

At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a hobgoblin, you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

---

## 1st Level

### Alchemical Scholar · Feat 1

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat. If you would automatically gain that feat (from your background or the alchemist class, for example), you instead gain a different 1st-level Crafting skill feat. Add an additional common 1st-level alchemical formula to your formula book when you take this feat. Each time you gain a level beyond 1st, add one common alchemical formula of that level to your formula book.

### Cantorian Reinforcement · Feat 1

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

The life energy that helped create the first hobgoblins is particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing maladies. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve the save in this way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

### Hobgoblin Lore · Feat 1

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

You've studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all of which have a militaristic bent. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Athletics and Crafting. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Hobgoblin Lore.

### Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity · Feat 1

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the hobgoblin trait. You have familiarity with weapons with the hobgoblin trait plus the composite longbow, composite shortbow, glaive, longbow, longsword, and shortbow—for the purpose of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.

At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

### Leech-Clip · Feat 1 · ◆◆

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

You are trained to capture deserters, or "leeches." Make a melee Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.

### Remorseless Lash · Feat 1

## 5th Level

### Agonizing Rebuke · Feat 5

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

When you terrorize your enemies, you also cause them painful mental distress. When you successfully Demoralize an enemy, that enemy takes 1d4 mental damage at the start of each of its turns. This effect ends if the creature loses the frightened condition, if it is more than 30 feet away from you, or if 1 minute passes, whichever comes first. If you have master proficiency in Intimidation, the damage increases to 2d4, and if you have legendary proficiency, the damage increases to 3d4.

---

### Expert Drill Sergeant · Feat 5

**Traits:** Hobgoblin

While exploring, when you are leading and allies are Following the Expert, instead of granting a +2 circumstance bonus in the applicable skill, you grant a +3 circumstance bonus if you're an expert and a +4 circumstance bonus if you're a master.
