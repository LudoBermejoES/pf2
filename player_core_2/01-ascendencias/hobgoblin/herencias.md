## Elfbane Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund goblins to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral resistance to magic, which they refer to as "elf magic."

**Benefit:** You gain the Resist Elf Magic reaction.

> **Resist Elf Magic** ◇
>
> **Trigger:** You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but haven't rolled yet.
>
> Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the triggering effect is arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.

## Runtboss Hobgoblin

You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you bellow.

**Benefit:** You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an Intimidation check to Coerce a goblin, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.

## Shortshanks Hobgoblin

You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age.

**Benefit:** You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not off-guard while you Climb.

## Smokeworker Hobgoblin

Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations, laboring on projects that bring smoke and fire to the field of battle.

**Benefit:** You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke.

## Warmarch Hobgoblin

You come from a line of wandering mercenaries constantly on the march and scavenging food on the trail.

**Benefit:** If you fail, but don't critically fail, to Subsist in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop.

## Warrenbred Hobgoblin

Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes.

**Benefit:** While you're underground, when you target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
