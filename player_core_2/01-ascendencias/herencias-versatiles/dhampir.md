# Dhampir

Many call vampires the children of the night, but it's dhampirs who can truly claim that title. These mortal offspring of vampires walk the line between life and undeath not just physiologically, but also in their social standing, temperament, and worldview. The circumstances surrounding a dhampir's birth are rare, complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors. Some dhampirs are the child of one mortal and one vampiric parent, while others are born to those who were turned into vampires while pregnant. Still others rise from occult rituals or other supernatural influences that impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant. The life of a dhampir is often difficult; few vampiric parents have the inclination to raise a mortal child, while mortal communities find a dhampir's sallow flesh, piercing eyes, and unnerving presence off-putting at best.

Despite being living creatures, dhampirs respond to vitality and void energy as if they were undead, making them unwelcome in many holy communities and often driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs aren't immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals, with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have difficulty producing children of their own, and those few born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves.

A dhampir generally resembles a member of their non-vampire parent's ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace, beauty, and charm despite their unsettling appearance.

## You Might...

- Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to blend into society or even hunting undead.
- Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to "helpful" healing magic.
- Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste of blood.

## Others Probably...

- Feel unsettled by your ghostly pallor and sharp teeth.
- Wonder about or even romanticize your origins and motivations.
- Find themselves strangely drawn to your grace, charm, and appearance.

## Dhampir (Uncommon Heritage)

You are the scion of a vampire, half living and half undead, gifted with uncanny charm and grace, a bloodless pallor, and elongated incisors. You gain the dhampir trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You have the void healing ability, which means you are harmed by vitality damage and healed by void effects as if you were undead. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can select from dhampir feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
