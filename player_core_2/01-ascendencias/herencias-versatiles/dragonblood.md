# Dragonblood

Dragons are powerful creatures, and many have involved themselves deeply in the lives of others. Some might be treated with reverence by a group of smaller humanoids, acting as their protector or, in rare cases, deity incarnate. Others take on a humanoid form to live within a civilization as their neighbors' equal, sometimes hiding their true identity to observe or manipulate. Whatever the dragon's intent or actions during these times, they leave an indelible impression on the people they encounter, whether or not those people realize it. A child may be born as the result of such an influence, and these offspring are known as dragonbloods.

A dragonblood may be born from any ancestry and found in just about any region of Golarion, as dragons tend to go where they please. Some dragonbloods possess obvious draconic traits, from clawed hands to leathery wings to a mighty reptilian tail; these features always resemble similar aspects of the dragonblood's draconic forebear. Other dragonbloods more closely resemble dragons than the other half of their heritage, leading many to mistake them for kobolds, iruxis, or other reptilian ancestries; such dragonbloods who are proud of their draconic lineage are quick to point out this mistake. There are also those dragonbloods whose outward appearances suggest only a hint of dragon blood. They might have a barely noticeable sheen to their skin or the small nubs of horns, but they often have an outsized force of personality or innate magical abilities.

Areas in which dragons have more influence or cultural significance see a higher population of dragonbloods than other places.

## You Might...

- Consider yourself quite courageous due to the influence of your draconic heritage.
- Revel in the deference some other ancestries pay to you and your ilk.
- Feel a burden of responsibility to live up to the legacy of your ancestors.

## Others Probably...

- Believe you are in a dragon's employ or are a dragon in disguise and want you to reveal the location of some treasure.
- Assume you can breathe fire or some other element.
- Mistakenly think touching your scales, horns, or wings will bring them good luck.

## Dragonblood (Uncommon Heritage)

You're descended in some way from a dragon. Your physical features might show this outwardly, with a pair of draconic horns, patches of scaly skin, or even a tail, or you might develop an internal reserve of draconic power. You gain the dragonblood trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. Add Draconic to your ancestry's list of additional languages (allowing you to choose it as a language if your Intelligence modifier is positive). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. You can choose from dragonblood feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

## Draconic Exemplars

Some abilities reference your draconic exemplar, which is a specific type of dragon from which you draw your draconic powers—typically the type of dragon whose blood runs in your veins. You can choose your exemplar when you create your character, but are only required to choose one when you select a feat or other option that requires you to have one (such as Breath of the Dragon). This means your draconic nature might be a mystery to you for some time.

| Dragon | Tradition | Speeds | Dragon Breath |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Adamantine | Primal | Burrow | Cone of bludgeoning (Reflex) |
| Conspirator | Occult | Climb | Cone of poison (Fortitude) |
| Diabolic | Divine | — | Cone of fire (Reflex) |
| Empyreal | Divine | — | Cone of spirit (Reflex) |
| Fortune | Arcane | — | Cone of force (Reflex) |
| Horned | Primal | Swim | Cone of poison (Fortitude) |
| Mirage | Arcane | Climb | Cone of mental (Will) |
| Omen | Occult | — | Cone of mental (Will) |

## 1st Level Feats

**Traits:** Dragonblood, Magical

Tapping into the physiology of your draconic ancestor, you can exhale a torrent of energy in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line, dealing 1d4 damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar. This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.

You've come to understand how dragons can invoke fear but also how they've contributed to society as a whole. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Diplomacy and Intimidation. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Dragon Lore.

When you cast this innate spell, you must transform into your draconic exemplar. However, if you have the Arcane Dragonblood, Divine Dragonblood, Occult Dragonkin, or Primal Dragonblood lineage feat, you can instead choose any dragon of that tradition.

---

### Lingering Breath · Feat 17
