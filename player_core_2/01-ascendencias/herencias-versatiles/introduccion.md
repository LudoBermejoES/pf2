# Versatile Heritages

The most common versatile heritages by far are those born from the pairing of two different ancestries, such as the aiuvarin and dromaar mixed heritages (Player Core 82). Other individuals are born under far stranger circumstances, such as having a parent who was affected by monstrous, undead, or extraplanar energies. As these circumstances aren't unique to a single ancestry, these heritages are likewise shared by many ancestries.

Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages. Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many, however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy, whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors, or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that plane. These individuals are known as planar scions.

Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile heritages aren't limited to a single ancestry, a versatile heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common among certain ancestries than others, and some might list additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting.

## Playing a Versatile Heritage

To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select your ancestry, just like you would for any character. You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from those normally available to that ancestry, apply your chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry.

Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have only one, and you can't have any other heritage in addition to your versatile heritage.

Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry. In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting abilities your character has.

When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from those available to your ancestry as well as those specific to your versatile heritage.

## Lineage Feats

Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have the lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological lineage your character has—such as the type of vampire that birthed a dhampir character, or the type of dragon that influenced a dragonblood's birth. You can have only one lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.

## Roleplaying a Versatile Heritage

As most versatile heritages are uncommon or rare, playing a character with a versatile heritage generally offers unique and sometimes challenging roleplaying opportunities. The origins of a character's versatile heritage immediately offers a strong chance to create an interesting and compelling background for your character.

While obvious events related to a character's birth, such as having unique parentage, offer explanations for a character's versatile heritage, this might also be a good opportunity to create an even more personalized explanation for the heritage.

A versatile heritage can influence not only a character's origins, but also their outlook and personality. The nature of a versatile heritage causes a character to stand out among most cultures and societies. In many cases, a versatile heritage might isolate a character. This can manifest in distrust of the character's origins, an unhealthy fixation with the character, or any other unfortunately othering responses from strangers.

Of course, players who would rather ignore all of these roleplaying opportunities and challenges are encouraged to do so as well. Roleplaying a character should be a rewarding and exciting experience overall, and removing these additional aspects is perfectly reasonable.

## In This Book

This book includes the rules for three versatile heritages:

- **Dhampir:** The mortal offspring of undead vampires are caught between life and undeath, mortality and immortality, mundane existence and powerful magic.
- **Dragonblood:** While there are many ways a mortal can be imbued with draconic powers, dragonbloods have an inherent natural affinity.
- **Duskwalker:** A duskwalker isn't born; they are instead created, each manifesting as a mortal child in a location with close ties to death.
