# Ancestry Feats for Tripkee

At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a tripkee, you select from among the following ancestry feats.

---

## 1st Level

### Croak Talker · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tripkee

You can communicate with the simplest of frogs and other similar creatures using long-winded croaks. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals that are amphibians (most amphibians have the amphibious trait).

---

### Hunter's Defense · Feat 1 · ◇

**Traits:** Tripkee

**Prerequisites:** trained in Nature

**Frequency:** once per hour

**Trigger:** A creature with the animal, beast, elemental, fey, fungus, or plant trait attacks you, and you can see the attacker.

Your canny understanding of natural and primal creatures helps you predict and dodge their attacks. The triggering attack roll targets your Nature DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn't take the –2 circumstance penalty against the attack.

---

### Jungle Strider · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tripkee

You are adept at dodging roots, foliage, and other jungle obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain in forests and jungles. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of plant material, you aren't off-guard, and when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.

### Nocturnal Tripkee · Feat 1

**Traits:** Tripkee

You tend to do most of your hunting and work at night and have adapted to the requirements of nocturnal life. You gain darkvision, allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness, you see in black-and-white only.
