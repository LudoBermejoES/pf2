## Usage Notes

1. Copy the entire prompt text (everything after the backticks)
2. Paste into Midjourney's Discord chat or web interface
3. Adjust the `--ar 3:4` parameter if you want different aspect ratios:
   - `--ar 1:1` for square
   - `--ar 16:9` for landscape
   - `--ar 4:3` for slightly wider
4. Add `--quality 2` at the end for higher quality (uses more credits)
5. Add `--style raw` for less stylized results
6. You can substitute `by Wayne Reynolds` with other fantasy artists like:
   - `by Paizo illustrators`
   - `by D&D official artists`
   - `by fantasy book cover artists`

## Tips for Best Results

- Keep the prompts in English (Midjourney works best with English)
- The "Pathfinder 2e style" and "Wayne Reynolds" references help ensure a consistent fantasy illustration style
- If a generation doesn't match your vision, you can remix and ask for variations
- Consider generating multiple versions and selecting your favorite
- The portrait compositions (`--ar 3:4`) work well for character art
