## Animal Vision · Spell 3

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** primal

**Cast:** 1 minute

**Range:** 120 feet; **Targets:** 1 animal

**Duration:** 1 hour

You tap into the target's senses, allowing you to sense whatever it senses for the spell's duration. If the target wishes to prevent you from doing so, it can attempt a Will save, negating the spell on a success, but most animals don't bother to do so. While tapping into the target's senses, you can't use your own body's senses, but you can change back and forth from your body's senses to the target's senses using a Sustain action.

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Range:** 120 feet; **Area:** 10-foot burst

**Defense:** basic Reflex; **Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

You use your mind to manipulate unattended objects in the area, temporarily animating them to attack. The objects hover in the air, then hurl themselves at nearby creatures in a chaotic flurry of debris. This assault deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you Sustain this spell, it deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area.

**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 2d10, and the subsequent damage increases by 1d10.

You tap into the target's inner being and curse it to become a bestial version of itself. The effect is based on its Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's body gains minor bestial features. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be clumsy 1 for 1 round. When it recovers from the clumsy condition, its features revert to normal, and the spell ends.

**Failure** The target transforms into a bestial form for 1 hour. The target becomes clumsy 1 and gains weakness 1 to silver. It gains a claw, hoof, horn, or jaws Strike (your choice) that uses the target's unarmed Strike statistics except that the damage type changes to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate. Whenever the target attempts to use any manipulate action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is unlimited.

## Blanket of Stars · ◆◆ · Spell 6

**Traits:** Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate

**Traditions:** occult, primal

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak. While outside under a starry night sky, you're also invisible as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you're concealed instead.

Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is dazzled until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature is confused and dazzled until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target damages you, it can't observe you until the end of its turn.

**Critical Failure** As success, and for an unlimited duration, the first time each round the target damages a creature, it can't observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages several creatures at once, the creature it can't perceive is chosen randomly among those creatures.

---

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, occult, primal

When no blisters are left, the spell ends.

**Failure** As success, but the target grows two blisters.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the target grows four blisters.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage of a popped blister increases by 1d6.

**Traits:** Auditory, Concentrate, Emotion, Fear, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** occult

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Will

A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth—words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe.

## Bullhorn · ◆◆ · Cantrip 1

**Traits:** Auditory, Cantrip, Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the volume, this doesn't make your voice jarring or distracting. This doesn't increase the range or area of other auditory or linguistic effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block or muffle your voice as normal.

Your loud voice makes it easier to Coerce others, and the acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1 status bonus to checks to Coerce and auditory Performance checks to Perform at a large venue.

You can Dismiss the spell.

**Heightened (5th)** Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200 feet away.

**Heightened (7th)** Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1 mile away.

## Carryall · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Force, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Duration:** 8 hours

A small platform of magical force materializes adjacent to you to carry cargo. It is invisible or has a ghostly appearance, is 2 feet in diameter, and follows 5 feet behind you, floating just above the ground. It holds up to 5 Bulk of objects (if they can fit on it). Any objects atop the platform fall to the ground when the spell ends. You can Sustain the spell to move the platform up to 30 feet along the ground, to make it stay in place, or to have it return to you and resume following you.

The spell ends if a creature tries to ride atop the platform, if the platform is overloaded, if anyone tries to lift or force the platform higher above the ground, or if you move more than 60 feet away from the platform.

**Heightened (4th)** The platform can carry 10 Bulk, creatures can ride atop it, and it can hover in the air, not just on the ground.

## Chameleon Coat · ◆◆◆ · Spell 5

**Traits:** Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate

**Traditions:** primal

**Range:** 15 feet; **Targets:** up to 8 creatures

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You shift the colors of the targets' outermost layer of clothing and gear to be closer to their environment when they remain still. Creatures affected by the spell gain a +3 status bonus to Stealth checks to Hide. The changed color granted by the spell always shifts to match the environment, even if there are drastic changes. If any piece of gear or clothing affected by the spell is removed from a creature, the spell ends for that creature.

**Heightened (6th)** If a creature affected by this spell rolls a critical failure on its Stealth check to Sneak within 30 feet of a creature that would spot it, it instead only fails its check, as the spell mildly hypnotizes the spotter.

**Heightened (8th)** As 6th rank, and the status bonus is +4.

## Charitable Urge · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Incapacitation, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** varies

You speak on the virtue of charity, compelling the target to give away its possessions. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target has no items on its person, the spell fails.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is stunned 1 as it wrestles with the urge.

**Failure** On its next turn, before it does anything else, the target must present the nearest creature with an item in its possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if the only item it has is one that it's currently using to defend itself, such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can choose to be stunned for 1 round instead of giving up the item. This might require the target to Interact to retrieve an item or move to reach the nearest creature, and passing the item off requires an Interact action as normal.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and the target must repeat the effects of a failure on each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, ending the effects entirely on a critical success.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is permanently enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as sound body can remove these conditions).

A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are dazzled while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light.
