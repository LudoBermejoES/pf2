## Reaper's Lantern · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Aura, Concentrate, Death, Light, Manipulate

**Traditions:** divine, occult, primal

**Area:** 5-foot emanation

**Defense:** Fortitude; **Duration:** 1 minute

You call forth a ghostly lantern that guides the living toward death and the undead toward true death. It sheds bright light in the spell's area and dim light to twice that area. The lantern is insubstantial and floats near you, suspended from an ephemeral, skeletal hand. Living creatures and undead in the area when you Cast the Spell, or that enter the area later, must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area. Once a creature attempts a save against reaper's lantern, it uses the same outcome if it leaves the area and enters it again.

Once per turn, starting on the round after you cast reaper's lantern, you can Sustain the spell to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet. When you do so, you force creatures in the area that haven't yet attempted a save against reaper's lantern to attempt one.

## Resplendent Mansion · Spell 9

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Structure

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Cast:** 1 minute

**Range:** 500 feet

**Duration:** until your next daily preparations

You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to 300 feet on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and it's decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally.

Your mansion contains the same types and quantities of foodstuffs and servants as created by the planar palace spell. Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you Cast the Spell, and each has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.

## Rouse Skeletons · ◆◆ · Spell 3

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** 60 feet; **Area:** 10-foot burst

**Defense:** Reflex; **Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

Misshapen skeletal forms erupt from a solid surface, such as a stone floor, and fill the burst. The area they fill is difficult terrain. Their grasping claws deal 2d6 slashing damage to creatures on the ground in the area when the skeletons first appear with a basic Reflex save.

On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can move the area of skeletons up to 20 feet within the range of the spell and deal 2d6 slashing damage with a basic Reflex save to each creature in the new area.

Damaging or destroying the skeletons is irrelevant, as new bones pull forth from the ground to repair and replace any that are obliterated.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.

## Sacred Form · ◆◆ · Spell 6

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Polymorph

**Traditions:** divine

**Duration:** 1 minute

You focus all your divine energy and transform yourself into a battle form, similar to your normal form and of the same size as you, but wielding powerful divine armaments. While in this form, you gain the statistics and abilities listed below. You have hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities.

- AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- Speed 40 feet.

- A special attack with a sacred armament, which is the only attack you can use. Your attack modifier with the sacred armament is +21, and your damage bonus is +8 (or +6 for a ranged attack). The damage dice for Strikes with the weapon are 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 spirit damage. If you have a deity, you can have the weapon take the form of your deity's favored weapon and use its damage die size, damage type, and traits. If the favored weapon is a simple weapon with 1d4 or 1d6 damage die, the weapon damage dice are one size larger than normal, though the spirit damage is unchanged. You can also use your attack modifier with this favored weapon if it's higher than that given by the spell.
- Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own is higher.

**Heightened (8th)** You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15 temporary Hit Points, resistance 4 against physical damage, attack modifier +28, damage bonus +15 (+12 for a ranged attack), and Athletics +29.

Your eldritch song sends pulsing waves of ethereal energy to attack creatures' spirits in the area, dealing 14d6 spirit damage that causes their bodies to momentarily freeze up from the hypnotic nature of the tune, depending on the result of their Fortitude save.

Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving throw. A creature that critically fails its save is disoriented by the explosion of water, becoming off-guard until the end of your next turn.

**Traits:** Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate

**Traditions:** occult

**Range:** 60 feet; **Area:** 4 cubes, each 10 feet on a side

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** 1 minute

You cause the areas to appear to swell, bend, and break, twisting together in a bizarre spatial geometry. The cubes of the spell's area can't be adjacent to one another. A creature must attempt a Will save if it's in one of the cubes when you Cast the Spell, or if it later enters one of the areas, with the following effects. A creature interacting with the illusion can also attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion, as normal.

**Success** The creature disbelieves the illusion.

**Failure** All terrain in the cubes is difficult terrain for the creature, including the air if the creature is flying, walls if it's climbing, and so on. When the creature would exit one of the cubes, it exits from one randomly determined by the GM. This is a teleportation effect. It can exit from any edge of that cube it chooses. When selecting a random cube, the GM excludes any that don't match the creature's terrain; for instance, if the creature were exiting along the ground, the GM would exclude any cube that didn't have an exit on the ground.

## Sudden Blight · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Void

**Traditions:** divine, primal

**Range:** 120 feet; **Area:** 20-foot burst

You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living creature in the area takes 2d10 void damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature afflicted by a disease takes a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.

You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. Sudden blight attempts to counteract any magical effect on the plants before withering them.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.

## Summon Lesser Servitor · ◆◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Summon

**Traditions:** divine

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

While deities jealously guard their most powerful servants from the summoning spells of those who aren't steeped in the faith, this spell allows you to conjure an inhabitant of the Outer Sphere with or without the deity's permission. You summon a celestial, fiend, or monitor of level –1. You can choose to instead summon an animal of level –1 that hails from the Outer Sphere; you can choose for this animal to gain the celestial and holy traits, the fiend and unholy traits, or the monitor trait.

It's anathema to summon a servitor if it has a holy or unholy trait that isn't allowed for your deity's sanctification. For example, Sarenrae's sanctification is "can choose holy," so you couldn't summon an unholy creature, and Pharasma's is "none," so you couldn't summon a holy or unholy creature. The GM might determine that your deity restricts specific types of creatures further, making it anathema to summon them as well.

**Heightened (2nd)** The creature can be level 1 or lower.

**Heightened (3rd)** The creature can be level 2 or lower.

**Heightened (4th)** The creature can be level 3 or lower.

## Synesthesia · ◆◆ · Spell 5

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** occult

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

The target's senses are suddenly rewired in unexpected ways, causing them to process noises as bursts of color, smells as sounds, and so on. This has three effects, and the target must attempt a Will save.

- Due to the distraction, the target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check each time it uses a concentrate action, or the action fails and is wasted.
- The target's difficulty processing visual input makes all creatures and objects concealed from it.
- The creature has trouble moving, making it clumsy 3 and giving it a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is affected for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is affected for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is stunned 2 as it attempts to process the sensory shifts.

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to five creatures.
