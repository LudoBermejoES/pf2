## Déjà Vu · ◆◆ · Spell 1

**Traits:** Concentrate, Incapacitation, Manipulate, Mental

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Range:** 100 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** 2 rounds

You loop a thought process in the target's mind, forcing it to repeat a moment's worth of actions. The target must attempt a Will save. If the target fails, whatever actions the target uses on its next turn, it must repeat on its following turn. The actions must be repeated in the same order and as close to the same specifics as possible. For example, if the target makes an attack, it must repeat the attack against the same creature, if possible, and if the target moves, it must move the same distance and direction, if possible, on its next turn.

If the target can't repeat an action, such as Casting a Spell that has been exhausted or needing to target a creature that has died, it can act as it chooses for that action but becomes stupefied 1 until the end of its turn.

## Dismantle · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, primal

**Range:** touch; **Targets:** 1 non-magical object in your possession of 1 Bulk or less

**Duration:** 1 minute

You touch an object, and it immediately disassembles itself into its component pieces. The spell fails if the target lacks component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap typically triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and the component pieces become small enough to be hidden under normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell.

When the spell ends, the object reassembles itself into its original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise. Once reassembled, the object loses the broken condition, and its Hit Points return to the value the object had when you Cast the Spell.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts for 10 minutes.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell lasts until your next daily preparations.

## Dream Council · Spell 8

**Traits:** Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate, Mental, Sleep

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Cast:** 10 minutes

**Range:** planetary; **Targets:** up to 12 creatures you know by name and have met in person

**Duration:** 1 hour

When you Cast this Spell, any targets—including you—can choose to immediately fall asleep. The spell ends for any creatures that don't choose to fall asleep. Sleepers join a shared dream, where they can communicate with one another as though they were in the same room. Individual targets leave this shared dream upon awakening, and if all the targets awaken, the spell ends.

## Drop Dead · ◇ · Spell 5

**Traits:** Uncommon, Illusion, Manipulate, Subtle, Visual

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Trigger:** A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.

**Range:** 120 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Duration:** sustained up to 1 minute

The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action.

## Dull Ambition · ◆◆ · Spell 4

**Traits:** Concentrate, Curse, Manipulate, Mental, Misfortune

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** 120 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** varies

You curse the target to fail in all avenues of its life that require drive and ambition, as it inadvertently undermines its own goals at every turn. The effect is based on the target's Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** For 1 hour, the target rolls twice and uses the lower result on initiative rolls.

**Failure** For 1 day, the target rolls twice and uses the lower result on initiative rolls and any check to determine the success of a downtime activity.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is unlimited.

## Familiar's Face · ◆◆ · Spell 3

**Traits:** Concentrate, Manipulate, Scrying

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult, primal

**Range:** 1 mile; **Targets:** 1 willing creature that's your animal companion or familiar

**Duration:** sustained

The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you Cast a Spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as see the unseen, while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use Command an Animal on the target as part of Sustaining this spell. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you Cast this Spell.

## Final Sacrifice · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Fire, Manipulate

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult, primal

**Range:** 120 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature with the minion trait that you summoned or permanently control

**Defense:** basic Reflex

You channel disruptive energies through the bond between you and your minion, causing it to violently explode. The target is immediately slain, and the explosion deals 6d6 fire damage to creatures within 20 feet of it with a basic Reflex save.

If the target has the cold or water trait, the spell deals cold damage and has the cold trait instead of the fire trait. Attempting to cast this spell targeting a creature that you temporarily seized control of, such as an undead commanded by bind undead, automatically fails and breaks the controlling effect.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.

## Fungal Infestation · ◆◆ · Spell 2

**Traits:** Concentrate, Fungus, Manipulate, Poison

**Traditions:** primal

**Range:** touch; **Area:** 15-foot cone

**Defense:** Fortitude

Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.

**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it's taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it's taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
