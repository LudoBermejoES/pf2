**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points. You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to delay affliction for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.

**Heightened (+1)** The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points, and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.

### Life-Giving Form · ◆◆ · Focus 6

This is a vitality healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by vitality damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes 3d4 vitality damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.

You can Dismiss this spell.

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 5, and the electricity damage from the charged water form increases by 1.
