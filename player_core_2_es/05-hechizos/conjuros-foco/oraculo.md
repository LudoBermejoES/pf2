**Traits:** Uncommon, Focus, Healing, Manipulate, Oracle, Vitality

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature other than you

**Duration:** 1 minute

You forge a connection of life energy between you and your target, distributing harm between both of you. When you first Cast the Spell, the target recovers 1d4 Hit Points. The first time each round that the target takes damage, reduce the damage it takes by 3 (to a minimum of 0 damage).

### Delay Affliction · ◆◆ · Focus 3

**Traits:** Uncommon, Concentrate, Focus, Healing, Manipulate, Oracle, Vitality

**Range:** 30 feet; **Targets:** 1 creature

With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points. You attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to delay affliction for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.

**Heightened (+1)** The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points, and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.

---

### Life-Giving Form · ◆◆ · Focus 6

**Traits:** Uncommon, Concentrate, Focus, Healing, Light, Manipulate, Oracle, Vitality

**Duration:** 1 minute

You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch. You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to void damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 vitality damage.

You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to restore 6d8 Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form's healing for 1 minute. This is a vitality healing effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by vitality damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes 3d4 vitality damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.

You can Dismiss this spell.

**Heightened (+1)** The Hit Points restored with an Interact action increases by 1d8, the vitality damage increases by 1, and the resistance and weakness increases by 1.

**Range:** 60 feet; **Targets:** up to 6 creatures

**Defense:** Will; **Duration:** until the start of your next turn

You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness with a numerical value that you believe one or more of the targets have due to Recall Knowledge or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.

Your body becomes fluid. Choose whether to become air, water, or mist. The spell gains the air trait if you choose air or mist, and the water trait if you choose water or mist.

You also gain resistance 10 to physical damage and become immune to precision damage. You can slip through tiny cracks and don't need to breathe. You can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait, except those granted by this spell. You also gain the following effects based on your form.

If you do, you are no longer invisible in the water due to electricity indicating your location, but any creature that makes a melee attack against you takes 1d6 electricity damage.

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 5, and the electricity damage from the charged water form increases by 1.
