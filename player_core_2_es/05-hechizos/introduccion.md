## Your Spellcasting Style

If you're playing a spellcaster, it can be fun to consider your personal spellcasting style. Casters of different traditions usually have the biggest gulf between them in how they cast spells, but there's also differentiation between—and within—classes!

### Preparing your Spells

If you prepare spells, consider what it looks like as you do so. Typically, arcane spellcasters consult their books, self-reflect, or otherwise study; divine casters pray to fill their heart with spells that will serve their deity; occult casters attempt to decipher cryptic messages, often while referencing occult texts; and primal casters might seek natural places to contemplate their magic, such as a grove or underground cavern.

Spontaneous spellcasters, not needing to prepare, tend to wake up with their magical reserves restored. This might be a refreshed or vivacious feeling, a teeming thrum throughout the body, or a sense of impending dread or awe.

### Casting your Spells

For one spellcaster, casting a spell is a stressful, painful process. For another, it's a moment of triumph as they outsmart their enemy with just the right trick.

As mentioned on page 299 of Player Core, the manifestation of your magic might produce different sensory effects. You should also think about the nature of the gestures and vocal incantations you use to cast that spell. Do you chant with a different timbre than your normal speaking voice? Does this voice resemble that of your deity or some other supernatural being? When you gesture, what does it look like? Are they abstract motions that correspond to different facets of the magic? Perhaps you always end your incantations with a firm, direct gesture, like pointing your finger or raising a fist. The particulars of spellcasting are abstracted, so you can customize each facet for your character.

### Refocusing

Your class briefly describes what you need to do to Refocus, such as meditating for the monk. Start out with some idea of what this looks like for you and refine it during play. What you need to do to Refocus is broadly defined to allow a variety of methods that make sense in the story. One sorcerer might absentmindedly twirl a shiny dragon scale—a remnant of a draconic ancestor—in their hand with their familiar, while another might contemplate the flow of a nearby river to remind themself of the power of water.

## Spell Traits

Several sections within the full rules for casting spells in Player Core cover how spell traits function, including traits like morph and subtle. Spell traits usually apply only to spells, but the traits concentrate and manipulate apply to other actions. All spells have the concentrate or manipulate trait (or both). Below are some reminders on how these traits work with spells.

**Concentrate:** Spells with the concentrate trait require you to focus on your magic. If the spell has a casting time longer than a few actions (such as a full minute or even 10 minutes), you need to maintain that concentration and can't perform other actions. If your concentration is broken (such as if a fight begins), your spell is disrupted.

**Manipulate:** Spells with the manipulate trait require you to physically use a locus or make definitive gestures. If your hands are bound, you might not be able to cast such spells. Remember that actions with the manipulate trait often trigger reactions, some of which have the possibility of disrupting your spell.
