## Held Items

---

### Cloth of Nullification · Item 20

**Traits:** Rare, Magical

**Price** 75,000 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

This small piece of embroidered cloth is inimical to all magic.

**Activate—Nullify Magic** ◆◆ (manipulate) **Effect** You cover a magic item with the cloth or wave the cloth near a magic effect and attempt to counteract the effect or item. The cloth's counteract check modifier is +32, and its counteract rank is 10. Regardless of the result, the cloth of nullification can't be activated again for 2d6 hours. On a success, the effect or item is deactivated for the same amount of time, and its duration, if any, continues to expire during that time. With a successful counteract check, you can instead choose to completely absorb the magic from the effect or item into the cloth of nullification. If you do, both become completely non-magical and their magic can't be recovered, even by the remake spell.

The cloth of nullification automatically fails to counteract most artifacts and similarly powerful items.

### Earthsight Box · Item 9

**Traits:** Uncommon, Magical, Scrying

**Price** 575 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This fine wooden box is inlaid with Dwarven runes, with hinges and a clasp of iron. The box contains handfuls of fine sand.

**Activate—Replicate Earth** 1 minute (concentrate, manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You hold the box closed and, while envisioning the terrain, turn the box clockwise three times. When you open the box, the sand reveals, in miniature, the stone terrain surrounding you, to a range of 60 feet. This shows details of paths, hills, embankments, boulders, and even artificial structures like walls and ditches, as long as they're made of stone and earth. If you're underground, it reveals tunnels and voids in the earth within 60 feet at your current depth. The sand maintains its shape until you close the box.

### Predictable Silver Piece · Item 1

**Traits:** Magical

**Price** 3 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** —

This seemingly unremarkable, weathered silver coin bears the bust of an unnamed monarch on the face and a majestic bird on the tail. You can toss the coin without activating it, in which case it follows the normal laws of probability.

**Activate—Cheat Fate** ◆ (manipulate) **Effect** You rub your thumb on one side of the coin with the intent of slightly tweaking the strands of fate, then flip the coin into the air in a coin toss. No matter how the toss is resolved—letting the coin fall to the ground, slapping it down on the back of your hand, or catching it on your open palm—it always lands with the side you rubbed face up.

---

### Twisting Twine · Item 3+

**Traits:** Magical

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This ball of hempen twine resists efforts to unravel it by hand.

**Activate—Unravel Twine** ◆ (manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You toss the ball of twine into a square within 20 feet. The twine then unravels and animates, attempting to Disarm or Trip (your choice) a creature in the square with a total of +9 to the Athletics check. At the end of your turn, the twine winds itself back into a ball and returns to your hand; if you don't have a free hand, it returns to your space instead.

| Type | Level | Price | Effect |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Lesser twisting twine | 3 | 45 gp | +9 Athletics modifier, once per day |
| Moderate twisting twine | 5 | 125 gp | +12 Athletics modifier, once per hour |

### Urn of Ashes · Item 9

**Traits:** Magical, Void

**Price** 700 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** —

This pewter urn contains the ashes of a benevolent ancestor, with a sliver of lingering spirit that strives to protect you.

**Activate—Doom the Urn** ◇ (concentrate) **Trigger** You would become doomed, or your doomed value would increase; **Requirements** The ashes aren't doomed; **Effect** The ashes in the urn intervene, taking the doomed condition in your place, and you don't gain or increase the value of your doomed condition. Each night when you get a full night's rest, you can reduce your own doomed condition or that of the urn, but not both.

**Activate—Spirit's Wrath** ◆ (attack, concentrate, manipulate) **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** The urn shoots a bolt of void energy at a foe within 30 feet. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, using a modifier of +15 or your own spell attack modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the bolt deals 4d4 void damage (doubled on a critical success).

## Staves

### Staff of Impossible Visions · Item 6+

**Traits:** Uncommon, Magical, Staff

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

This bizarre staff is made from oak, capped with a cluster of eye-shaped gemstones that seem to move and undulate at the corner of your vision. While wielding the staff, you can peer through the eyes on the staff rather than your own, using your normal visual senses (including any benefits of spells like see the unseen). You can maneuver the staff to see things around corners, at higher elevations, or in places where the staff can fit but your head can't. This doesn't provide sufficient line of effect to target creatures around corners. The eyes are as vulnerable as your eyes and can be affected by anything that alters your vision, such as a blinding flash of light.

A staff of the tempest is usually crafted from the wood of a tree struck by lightning. It's often gnarled and blackened with the occasional spark of electricity flashing from its length. While wielding the staff, your vision is less inhibited by stormy weather. While you hold the staff, you ignore the concealed condition from mist, precipitation, and the like.
