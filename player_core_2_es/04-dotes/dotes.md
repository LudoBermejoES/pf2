## Descripciones de dotes

### Un hogar en cada puerto · Dote 11

**Rasgos:** Entre descansos, General

**Prerrequisitos:** Carisma +3

You have a reputation in towns and villages you've visited, and residents are always willing to open their doors to you. When in a town or village, during downtime, you can spend 8 hours to locate a resident willing to provide lodging for you and up to six allies for up to 24 hours at no charge. The standard of living within the acquired lodging is comfortable (GM Core 50), and square meals are provided at no cost. After 24 hours, you must pay standard prices for further lodging and meals or use this feat again to find a new resident willing to host you.

---

### Intérprete acrobático · Dote 1

**Rasgos:** General, Habilidad

**Prerrequisitos:** entrenado en Acrobacias

You're an incredible acrobat, evoking wonder and enrapturing audiences with your prowess. You can roll an Acrobatics check instead of a Performance check when using the Perform action. If you are trained in both Acrobatics and Performance, you gain a +1 circumstances bonus on Acrobatics checks made to Perform.

---

### Maestría en acrobacias aéreas · Dote 7

**Rasgos:** General, Habilidad

**Prerrequisitos:** maestro en Acrobacias

You move with grace in flight and can perform amazing aerial stunts. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Maneuver in Flight and can combine two maneuvers into a single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 5. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you can combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

---

### Asistencia con armadura · Dote 1

**Rasgos:** General, Habilidad

**Prerrequisitos:** entrenado en Atletismo o Saber bélico

You are practiced in helping yourself and others don heavy gear. You can attempt an Athletics or Warfare Lore check with a DC determined by the GM (usually DC 15 for common armor, DC 20 for uncommon armor, and DC 25 for rare armor) to halve the time you take to don armor. You can halve an ally's time to don armor by working with them to don the armor and succeeding at an Athletics or Warfare Lore check against the same DC.

---

### Sigilo con armadura · Dote 2

**Rasgos:** General, Habilidad

**Prerrequisitos:** experto en Sigilo

You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor and movements to reduce the noise you make. When you wear non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to Stealth checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). If you're a master in Stealth, reduce the penalty by 2, and if you're legendary, reduce the penalty by 3. If your armor has the noisy trait, instead of reducing the penalty to Stealth checks, you ignore the effects of the noisy trait, enabling you to remove the penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal.

---

### Identificación segura · Dote 2

**Rasgos:** General, Habilidad

**Prerrequisitos:** experto en Arcanos, Naturaleza, Ocultismo o Religión

You rarely misidentify an item. When using Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks to Identify Magic, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you would misidentify a cursed item because you roll a success but not a critical success (GM Core 306), you simply can't identify it instead.

---

### Backup Disguise · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Deception

You have a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn underneath your outer garment. You can change into this disguise to Impersonate as a 3-action activity. If you are a master in Deception, it is instead a 2-action activity, and if you are legendary in Deception, it is a single action. You can create a new backup disguise by spending the normal amount of time it takes you to Impersonate, but you can have only one backup disguise at a time. Having a backup disguise doesn't allow you to remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready, it's possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements of the disguise (see Conceal an Object in the Stealth skill).

---

### Battle Planner · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Warfare Lore

You are constantly drawing up plans and battle scenarios, assembling strategies and gathered intelligence for later use. When you scout an enemy's position or receive a detailed report from an ally who scouted the enemy's position, if you have a clear indication of the number, position, and identities of your potential foes, you can spend 1 minute to come up with a battle plan that takes such potential factors into account and reduces the role luck plays in the equation. Roll a Warfare Lore check. As long as the information was accurate and remains accurate when you roll initiative against those enemies, you can use the Warfare Lore result you previously rolled for your initiative roll; if you do, this is a fortune effect.

---

### Biographical Eye · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Secret, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Society

In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about a person's origin and history. You might notice bits of green under the person's fingernails and determine they're an herbalist, spy a pin indicating their membership in a secret society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city district where a vampire lives, but wouldn't learn any of their weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.

Spend 1 minute in the presence of someone you haven't met before, or haven't met since you first gained Biographical Eye, then attempt a DC 30 Society check. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you learn about their false biography rather than their true one unless the result of your Society check exceeds their Will DC.

**Critical Success** You learn the creature's profession, their specialty within that profession, and a major accomplishment or controversy from their career. You also learn the nation and settlement where they live, as well as the district in a city large enough to have districts. In addition, you learn the nation or settlement where they spent their formative years.

**Success** You learn the creature's profession and specialty within that profession. You learn the nation or settlement where they normally live.

**Failure** You learn the creature's profession and the region of the world they hail from, but no more.

**Critical Failure** You learn a piece of erroneous information about the creature.

---

### Bon Mot · ◆ · Feat 1

**Traits:** Auditory, Concentrate, Emotion, General, Linguistic, Mental, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Diplomacy

You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target's Will DC.

**Critical Success** The target is distracted and takes a –3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.

**Success** As critical success, but the penalty is –2.

**Critical Failure** Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.

---

### Caravan Leader · Feat 11

**Traits:** General

**Prerequisites:** Pick Up the Pace

You know how to get the most effort out of your allies on the road. Your group can Hustle for an additional 20 minutes beyond the length of time that the member who could Hustle longest on their own.

---

### Concealing Legerdemain · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Thievery

Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won't search, you're skilled at keeping the object on the move so it's never where they look. When you Conceal an Object of light Bulk or less, you can use Thievery instead of Stealth for your checks and for the DC of an active searcher's Perception check. You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.

---

### Consult the Spirits · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Secret, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Nature, Occultism, or Religion

**Frequency:** once per day

You have learned rites or meditations that enable you to perceive minor, invisible spirits within a place. Choose Nature, Occultism, or Religion when you select this feat. Nature allows you to contact the spirits of nature that form leshies, who are born of pure life essence rather than spiritual energy and can answer questions about natural features like the location of nearby water or plant life. Religion reveals the presence of angelic, demonic, or other spirits in service to divine beings, who provide information about sources of powerful life energy or energy from the Void; sacred or profane influences; or the presence of undead. Occultism allows you to contact lingering spirits, psychic echoes of the departed dead, and spirits from beyond reality, who tell you about things like strange auras, effects, or the presence of unnatural occult beings.

Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to Recall Knowledge with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually a very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you might encounter in the area). If you're legendary in the chosen skill, you can use this feat once per hour, instead of only once per day, but you can't use it again on any area that overlaps a previous area.

**Critical Success** The spirits reveal themselves to you and have a helpful attitude toward you. Only you can perceive these spirits. They answer three simple questions about the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact. Their answers are almost always a single word, and their knowledge is limited to within their area of interest.

**Success** As with a critical success, but the spirits are indifferent to you and answer only one question.

**Failure** You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.

**Critical Failure** You contact one or more malevolent spirits. They are hostile toward you, though they may not immediately appear so. They answer up to three questions but give you information that is harmful to you in some way, as determined by the GM.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, each time picking a different skill in which you have the master proficiency rank. You can use this feat with each skill once per day (or once per hour, if you're legendary).

---

### Crafter's Appraisal · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Crafting

Your knowledge of items' construction allows you to discern their magical effects as well. You can use Crafting instead of a skill associated with a magic tradition to Identify Magic on magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.

---

### Deceptive Worship · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Occultism

Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of Deception to Impersonate a typical worshipper of another faith or to Lie specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.

---

### Dirty Trick · ◆ · Feat 1

**Traits:** Attack, General, Manipulate, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Thievery

**Requirements:** You have a hand free and are within melee reach of an opponent.

You hook a foe's bootlaces together, pull their hat over their eyes, loosen their belt, or otherwise confound their mobility through an underhanded tactic. Attempt a Thievery check against the target's Reflex DC.

**Critical Success** The target is clumsy 1 until they use an Interact action to end the impediment.

**Success** As critical success, but the condition ends automatically after 1 round.

**Critical Failure** You fall prone as your attempt backfires.

---

### Discreet Inquiry · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Deception or Diplomacy

You are subtle in your efforts to learn the things you need to know. When Gathering Information, you can hide the true subject of your inquiry among other topics of little interest to you without increasing the difficulty of the check or taking more time to Gather Information. Anyone trying to Gather Information to determine if someone else was asking around about the topic in question must exceed your Deception DC or the normal DC to Gather Information about your inquiries, whichever is higher, or else they don't learn of your efforts.

---

### Distracting Performance · ◆ · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Performance

Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your allies to Sneak away with ease. You Create a Diversion, except you roll a Performance check instead of Deception, and the benefits of successful checks apply to an ally of your choice instead of you. The effects of a success last until the end of that ally's turn, and can end early based on the ally's actions. You don't need to be observing your ally or know where they are, but you need to know they're present to choose them.

---

### Disturbing Knowledge · ◆◆ · Feat 7

**Traits:** Emotion, Fear, General, Mental, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Occultism

You utter a litany of dreadful names, prophecies, and descriptions of realms beyond mortal comprehension, drawn from your study of forbidden tomes and scrolls. Even those who don't understand your language are unsettled by these dire secrets. Attempt an Occultism check and compare the result to the Will DC of an enemy within 30 feet, or to the Will DCs of any number of enemies within 30 feet if you are legendary in Occultism. Those creatures are temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Critical Success** The target becomes confused for 1 round and frightened 1.

**Success** The target becomes frightened 1.

**Failure** The target is unaffected.

**Critical Failure** You get overly caught up in your own words and become frightened 1.

---

### Doublespeak · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master at Deception

You're skilled at saying one thing and meaning something different. You disguise your true meaning behind other words and phrases, relying on subtle emphasis and shared experience to convey meaning that only your allies understand. Any allies who have traveled alongside you for at least 1 full week automatically discern your meaning. Other observers must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must critically succeed to understand the message itself.

---

### Environmental Guide · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Survival

You can rapidly adapt to climates and help others do the same. After an hour in an environment, you and up to five allies can treat the natural temperature effects of an environment (GM Core 95) as one step less severe (treat extreme cold as severe cold or extreme heat as severe heat, for instance). This reduction in severity is cumulative with any equipment (such as cold-weather gear) or spells (such as environmental endurance). If you're legendary in Survival, you may protect yourself and up to five allies, and you treat temperature effects as two steps less severe.

---

### Evangelize · ◆ · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Diplomacy, follower of a specific religion or philosophy

You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your faith, causing a listener's mind to whirl. Attempt a Diplomacy check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM's discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.

**Critical Success** The target is stupefied 2 for 1 round.

**Success** The target is stupefied 1 for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is unaffected.

---

### Exhort the Faithful · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Religion, follower of a specific religion

Your knowledge of the tenets of your faith gives you insight into the best ways to get others of your faith to help you or to follow your directions. When you Request something of or Coerce members of your own faith, you can attempt a Religion check instead of Diplomacy or Intimidation, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. On a critically failed attempt to make a Request, the target's attitude toward you doesn't worsen.

---

### Express Rider · Feat 1

**Traits:** Exploration, General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Nature

You can encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When calculating your travel Speed (Player Core 438) for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to Command an Animal to increase your mount's travel Speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount's level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your mount's travel Speed by half. This has no effect on your mount's movement in encounters. This benefit extends to up to six other allies traveling with you, as long as all such allies are also mounted, or are quadrupeds with a Speed of at least 30 feet.

---

### Eye for Numbers · ◆ · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Society

You've learned to quickly estimate the number of items in a group with relative accuracy at only a glance. You immediately learn the number of visually similar items in a group you can see, rounded to the first digit in the total number. For example, you could look at a case of potion vials and learn that it held about 30 vials, but you wouldn't know that it was exactly 33 vials, how many different types of potions there were, or how many of which type. Similarly, you could look at a pile of 2,805 coins and know that there were about 3,000 coins in all. You can use this ability only on items that can typically be counted, so you can't use it on grains of sand or stars in the sky, for example.

If you count a specific number of items possessed by an enemy, such as the number of coins or pieces of equipment they're carrying, you can use this information the next time you Feint or Create a Diversion against that target within 1 minute. If you do, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check and can use Society instead of Deception for the check.

You can use this action during an attempt to Decipher Writing that is primarily numerical or mathematical to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.

---

### Eyes of the City · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Diplomacy or Society

You can track down targets with the help of locals. You can use Diplomacy or Society, whichever you're trained in, to Track creatures in settlements. You chat with locals to help follow the trail of creatures you Track. At the GM's discretion, there might not be enough people to speak with to keep following the trail.

---

### Forensic Acumen · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Medicine

You understand principles of forensic medicine, making you better at examining a body to determine the cause of death or injury. You can perform a forensic examination on a body, as described under Recall Knowledge in the Medicine skill, in half the normal amount of time (to a minimum of 5 minutes). If you succeed at your check, you can attempt an immediate check to Recall Knowledge to follow up on something you found, with a +2 circumstance bonus. This check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such as a Crafting check to identify a poison or weapon used or an additional Medicine check to identify a specific disease. If you prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall Knowledge about the type of creature whose body you examined, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus.

The circumstance bonus increases to +3 if you have master proficiency in Medicine and +4 if you have legendary proficiency.

---

### Glean Contents · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Society

You are adept at quickly scanning loose papers and carefully discerning the contents of sealed letters without damaging the seal. You can attempt Society checks to Decipher Writing on a message that is only partially glimpsed, upside down or reversed from your perspective, and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check when doing so. You can also use this feat to decipher sealed letters, adding the manipulate trait to your attempt to Decipher Writing. This doesn't prevent witnesses from noticing your efforts; you might need to attempt Deception or Stealth checks to avoid being noticed. In either use of this feat, the recipient is made aware of your efforts on a critical failure (for instance, you might be caught rubbernecking or you might disturb the papers in a way their owner notices).

---

### Improvise Tool · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Crafting

You can jury-rig solutions when you don't have the proper tools on hand. You can attempt to Repair damaged items without a repair toolkit.

If you have the raw materials, you can Craft a basic caltrop set, candle, compass, crowbar, fishing tackle, flint and steel, hammer, ladder, piton, rope, 10-foot pole, replacement thieves' picks, long or short tool, or torch as if you had their formulas.

---

### Improvised Repair · ◆◆◆ · Feat 3

**Traits:** General

You can hastily patch damaged equipment together, but the temporary fix lacks the full care required for lasting repairs. You patch together a broken item possessed by you or an adjacent willing creature. Until the item takes damage again, it still functions as a shoddy item of its type (Player Core 270). If it's a magic item or another item with activations, it can't be activated while patched together, but can be used for normal functions (such as Striking with a weapon or using Shield Block with a shield). This activity restores no Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is Repaired normally such that it is no longer broken, it is also no longer shoddy.

---

### Incredible Scout · Feat 11

**Traits:** Exploration, General

**Prerequisites:** master in Perception

When you scout, you are particularly alert for danger, granting your allies precious moments to prepare to fight. When using the Scout exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

---

### Influence Nature · Feat 7

**Traits:** Downtime, General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Nature

With patience and time, you can make bird calls, leave game trails, and ultimately influence the behavior of a certain type of animals in the region to favor and even aid you in the days to come. The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time your work requires (usually at least a day or two of downtime). While you can't directly control how you've influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects, such as easier hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is approaching. If you're legendary in Nature, you can elicit these same adjustments to animal behavior in the area by spending only 10 minutes.

---

### Inoculation · Feat 1

**Traits:** General, Healing, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Medicine

You have practice combating plague, and your patients are less likely to succumb to the same disease again for a time. When you successfully Treat a Disease on someone and they fully recover from the disease, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that same disease for 1 week.

---

### Keen Follower · Feat 3

**Traits:** General

Your keen observation of your allies has made you better at following their lead. When using the Follow the Expert activity in exploration mode, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus if the ally you are following is an expert and a +4 circumstance bonus if your ally is a master.

You can share your observations with others to help further coordinate the group. If the ally you are following has Quiet Allies or another skill feat that allows the group to roll a single skill check for an exploration activity and use the lowest modifier, they can instead use your modifier, even if it's not the lowest.

### Lead Climber · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Athletics

When climbing, you can prepare routes for others to follow, and you can pull your allies up to avoid disaster. When your allies attempt to Climb a route you set using the Follow the Expert exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their checks to Climb, you can attempt an Athletics check against the same DC. If you succeed, your ally only fails instead of critically failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience the consequences of the critical failure.

### Legendary Guide · Feat 15

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** legendary in Survival

You know the wilderness so well that you can help your party travel through it with ease. When you are setting the path for your party through wilderness terrain, your party gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for the purpose of calculating the party's travel Speed (Player Core 438), your party's travel Speed doesn't decrease in difficult terrain, and greater difficult terrain halves your party's travel Speed instead of reducing it to a third. This doesn't increase your party's Speed during an encounter or allow your party to ignore difficult terrain during an encounter.

### Leverage Connections · Feat 2

**Traits:** Uncommon, General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Society, and either Courtly Graces or Streetwise

You know the right people who can get things done for you in certain circles. Once per week, when you're in an area that has an established group of influential nobles, mercantile elites, or the like (if you have Courtly Graces), or a network of unsavory characters such as a thieves' guild (if you have Streetwise), you can use Society to Request a favor or aid from those people as if they were friendly to you. Your request must make sense for the type of people you contact. For instance, a member of the royal court could secure you a proper invitation to a fancy ball, while a local burglar could point out a way to stealthily infiltrate that same party. If you critically succeed this check, your connection gives a piece of helpful advice or lets you in on a small secret, granting you or a member of your party a +2 circumstance bonus to the first skill check you attempt when acting on the favor. If you critically fail this check, you might have to perform some service for your connection to get back in their good graces, as determined by the GM.

If you lose this religious symbol, you must purchase or Craft a replacement and attune it. Such a token usually costs at least 1 sp, and the attunement takes 10 minutes of prayer.

### Rolling Landing · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

You land with quick rolls that help you keep your momentum.

Until the end of your next turn, it becomes holy water or unholy water. You can choose holy water if your deity allows holy sanctification, unholy water if your deity allows unholy sanctification, or either if your deity allows both sanctifications. This is a temporary effect and doesn't impart monetary value or allow the water to be used for costs of rituals or the like. If you're a master in Religion, you can sanctify two containers when you take this action, and if you're legendary, you can sanctify three.

### Signature Crafting · Feat 7

Magic items you create bear a stamp specific to your handiwork. When you successfully Craft a permanent magic item, roll a DC 9 flat check when the item is fully complete.

### Slippery Prey · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** trained in Acrobatics or Athletics

You're able to escape bonds more easily than others. When you attempt to Escape using Acrobatics or Athletics, you reduce the multiple attack penalty for repeated attempts to –4 and –8 if you're trained in the skill. The penalty becomes –3 and –6 if you're a master in the appropriate skill. If you're legendary in the skill, you don't take penalties for multiple Escape attempts in the same turn.

You can use the Craft activity to create snares (page 297). When you select this feat, you immediately add the formulas for four common 1st-level snares to your formula book.

---

### Sow Rumor · Feat 2

**Traits:** Uncommon, General, Secret, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Deception

You spread rumors, which may or may not be true, about a specific subject. If the subject of your rumor is not currently the subject of any contradictory rumors, this takes as long as it would normally take you to Gather Information (typically 2 hours), at the end of which the GM rolls a secret Deception check against a DC they set to see how well you spread the rumor. If your rumor matches any current rumors about the subject, it takes less time to spread, and if you are attempting to overtake a particularly popular and contradictory rumor, it takes much longer or may be impossible. The DC similarly increases or decreases depending on how plausible your rumor is. For example, it might be harder to sow a rumor that the beloved, generous mayor is the head of a cult of murderous demon worshippers.

**Critical Success** Your rumor spreads like wildfire. Anyone who succeeds at a check to Gather Information on the specific subject learns your rumor in preference to other rumors about the subject. Your rumor persists for 1 month. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks in an appropriate situation when you invoke your rumor.

**Success** You successfully spread the rumor. Anyone who succeeds at a check to Gather Information on the specific subject adds your rumor to the list of rumors they could learn about the subject. Your rumor persists for 1 week. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks in an appropriate situation when you invoke your rumor.

**Failure** Your rumor dies off, never becoming popular enough for other people to learn it via Gather Information.

**Critical Failure** You are unable to spread a rumor and take a –4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks to Sow Rumors about the same subject within the same region for 1 week. In addition, a rumor spreads about someone trying to spread false rumors about the subject.

### Supertaster · Feat 7

**Traits:** General

**Prerequisites:** master in Perception

You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage, you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives, such as poisons. The GM rolls a secret Perception check against a DC determined by the poison's level; if the food or drink is poisoned, on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used. If you successfully detect that the food or drink was poisoned, you can spit out the food or drink in time to not be exposed to that instance of the poison (unless you resume eating or drinking the poisoned food or beverage).

If you lick or taste something while Investigating or attempting to Recall Knowledge to identify something, and if the taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM's discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.

---

### Terrifying Resistance · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Intimidation

The spells of those you have Demoralized are less effective on you. If you succeed in Demoralizing a creature, for the next 24 hours you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that creature's spells.

---

### Thorough Search · Feat 3

**Traits:** General

**Prerequisites:** expert in Perception

You take your time searching to ensure you find everything. When Searching, you can take twice as long to search. Normally this means you Search at up to one quarter of your Speed, to a maximum of 150 feet per minute to check everything, or 75 feet per minute to check everything before you walk into an area. If you do and the GM rolls your secret check to Seek to notice something, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to that Perception check and if you succeed, you get a critical success instead.

---

### True Perception · Feat 19

**Traits:** General, Revelation

**Prerequisites:** legendary in Perception

Your perceptive abilities and ability to process sensory information are so far beyond the pale that you notice minute discrepancies in all sorts of illusions and physical transformations. You are constantly under the effects of a 6th-rank truesight spell, using your Perception modifier for the counteract check.

---

### Tumbling Teamwork · Feat 2

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Acrobatics

Your tumbling distracts a foe enough to create an advantage for one of your allies. When you successfully Tumble Through an enemy's space, an ally who is adjacent to that enemy can Step as a reaction, but they must remain adjacent to that enemy.

---

### Tumbling Theft · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Acrobatics and Thievery

You reach for an opponent's item as you move past a foe. If you critically succeed at your check to Tumble Through an enemy's space, you can attempt to Steal something from the enemy as a reaction. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Thievery check to Steal as your tumbling make it difficult for your enemy to keep track of your movement. You can Steal any immediately accessible item of light or negligible Bulk on the enemy's person, such as a potion or coin purse hanging from a belt, but not anything inside a container or anything the enemy is holding. The GM has final say on what you can Steal.

---

### Underground Network · Feat 2

**Traits:** Uncommon, General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** expert in Society, Streetwise

You're connected to groups that know what's going on in the streets, and you can get information out of them quickly. When you use Society to Gather Information in an area where you have a network (typically a settlement where you've spent at least a week or spent a day of downtime to build a network faster), you can contact a member of these groups to get information directly from them. This usually takes about an hour, and it doesn't draw as much attention as Gathering Information in public might. The check and information gained otherwise follow the normal rules for Gather Information.

In addition, if you have successfully consulted the underground network, you get a +1 circumstance bonus to the next check to Recall Knowledge you attempt about the subject you were Gathering Information on, or a +2 circumstance bonus if you're using Underworld Lore for the check. The GM might change the Lore skill related to the network depending on your location or the specifics of the network you're tapping into.

---

### Water Sprint · Feat 7

**Traits:** General, Skill

**Prerequisites:** master in Athletics

Experience and training have taught you that water has just enough surface tension for a master sprinter to traverse the surface. When you Stride in a straight line, if you move at least half your Speed over ground, you can move any amount of the remaining distance across a level body of water. If you don't end your Stride on solid ground, you fall into the water.

If you're legendary in Athletics, as long as you start on solid ground, any part of your Stride can cross the water's surface, even if you aren't moving a straight line, though you still fall into the water if you don't end your movement on solid ground.
