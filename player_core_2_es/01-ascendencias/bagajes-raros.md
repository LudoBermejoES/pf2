# Rare Backgrounds

While most backgrounds are available to any character, some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them makes a character rare and extraordinary.

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly different roleplaying experience by setting their character up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. Whether a character with the royalty background is heir to the throne of the kingdom where your campaign takes place or to a distant but powerful nation in the same world, the character is situated in a special position within the narrative. Your character's background is an intrinsic part of where they come from and not something they earn during the game. Rare backgrounds should be chosen only after a discussion between the GM and the other players as to whether one would apply for a particular character in your group's game.

Backgrounds can also be unique, such that no other character can have them if your character does. To create unique backgrounds, you can adapt the rare backgrounds in this section by including more specific details.

## Amnesiac

**Traits:** Rare

Your background is... well... honestly, you can't remember! You might have inklings deep within your mind, undercurrents of unusual emotions or unexpected responses to certain people or situations, but ultimately you don't know who you once were. You might be adventuring specifically to help discover yourself. It's up to you and the GM how to handle the truth of your character's backstory. You could leave it to the GM so it's a secret, work together with the GM, or even choose to leave it undecided until later. In any case, you and your GM should determine a few noteworthy details about your character or their belongings to get the first clues to your past.

You gain three free attribute boosts. You choose two, and the GM chooses the third based on their first inklings of your character's possible history.

## Blessed

**Traits:** Rare

You have been blessed by a divinity. For an unknown reason, and irrespective of your actual beliefs, a deity has granted you a boon to use for good or ill. Your blessing grants wisdom and insight to aid you in your struggles. You may or may not even know the identity of the being who blessed you, and the blessing might come with a cost you discover later on.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in a **Lore** skill associated with the deity who blessed you (such as Shelyn Lore) if you know their identity, or else in a Lore skill of the GM's choice if you don't. Either you can cast *guidance* as a divine innate spell at will, or you gain a similar blessing determined by the GM.

## Cursed

**Traits:** Rare

You are the victim of a personal or hereditary curse. Through great effort and occult study, you have learned to fend off the curse's worst effects and, by extension, you can protect yourself against other harmful magic. However, the curse still hangs over you and sometimes manifests in dangerous ways.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in **Occultism** and **Curse Lore**. You gain the **Warding Sign** reaction. You and the GM should determine the full effects of the curse, though you've staved most of them off for now. The GM determines the curse's lingering manifestations on you, which usually include at least a constant or very frequent thematic effect and occasional more dangerous effects.

### Warding Sign · ◇

**Traits:** Concentrate

**Frequency:** once per minute

**Trigger:** You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but you haven't rolled yet.

You call on the power of a personal, eldritch sign of protection, which flares brightly before slowly fading. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw, or a +3 circumstance bonus if the effect is a curse.

## Feral Child

**Traits:** Rare

You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.

Choose one attribute boost. It must be to **Strength**, **Dexterity**, or **Constitution**.

You are trained in **Nature** and **Survival**. You gain low-light vision (or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet, and the **Forager** skill feat.

## Feybound

**Traits:** Rare

You have spent time in the First World or another realm of the fey and aren't entirely the same person you were before. Perhaps you made a purchase at the legendary Witchmarket or partook deeply of fey food and wine. Whatever the case, willingly or inadvertently, you made a bargain with the fey, the benefits of which come at a price.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in **Fey Lore** and gain the **Fey's Fortune** free action. You gain an anathema as part of your pact with the fey. If you violate this anathema, you lose Fey's Fortune until you receive the effects of a successful *atone* ritual using the Nature skill. The exact anathema is up to you and the GM, but the most common requirement is that you must fulfill a single request from any fey who knows your name.

### Fey's Fortune · ◇

**Traits:** Concentrate, Fortune

**Frequency:** once per day

**Trigger:** You attempt a skill check and haven't yet rolled.

Roll the skill check twice and use the better result.

## Haunted

**Traits:** Rare

You are followed by a spirit or entity, either from childhood or since a momentous event. You and others may have seen this entity. You have studied esoteric subjects trying to understand your situation, but this presence in your life remains a mystery. Whatever this entity is or wants, it influences your life in subtle ways, and not always for the better. Sometimes the entity helps you, but at other times, its influence is malevolent or harmful. The entity is most likely to surface in stressful situations.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in **Occultism** and an additional skill in which the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any time you attempt a skill check for the entity's skill, the GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the entity were Aiding you. If you accept but fail the check, you are frightened 2 (frightened 4 on a critical failure). The initial frightened value can't be reduced by effects that would reduce or prevent the condition (such as a fighter's bravery).

## Returned

**Traits:** Rare

You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You gain the **Diehard** feat and the **Additional Lore** feat for Boneyard Lore.

---

## Royalty

**Traits:** Rare

You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have eschewed the daily routines of royal life and taken up an adventurous quest—perhaps you're a deposed queen hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a sovereign's heir on a secret mission.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You are trained in **Society**. You gain the **Courtly Graces** skill feat and can influence commoners in your family's territory, as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the **Leverage Connections** skill feat, you automatically have common and noble connections within any community in your royal family's territory and have noble connections in large communities outside your territory.
