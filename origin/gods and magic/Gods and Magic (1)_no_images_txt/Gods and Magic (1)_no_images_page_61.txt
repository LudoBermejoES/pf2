Slot necklace; Price  3,300 gp; Weight  —
deSCriPtion
This finger-length crystal is a pale opaque pink color when 
worn by a living creature, but slowly changes to a translucent deep violet when carried by the undead. You can eat spoiled food and drink spoiled liquid as if it were fresh and wholesome, tasting as good as it did before it spoiled. Any person with the Profession (cook) skill can use the crystal to season a meal with the flavor of salt, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, or pepper (or the equivalent spices for the undead palate—fear’s breath, nightfog, bloodroot, thileu bark, or hatefinger).
If Urgathoa is your patron, once per day you may use death 
knell. Both cure  and inflict  spells heal you, whether you are 
living or undead; the crystal flares with black or white energy when it converts this energy into a form that does not harm you. The crystal does not affect any other uses of positive or negative energy, just cure  and inflict  spells (or effects that 
duplicate these spells).
