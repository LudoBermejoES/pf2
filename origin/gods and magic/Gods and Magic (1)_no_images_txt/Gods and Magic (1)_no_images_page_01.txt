Pa thfinder ChroniCles Gods and Ma GiC
Creators of life, forgers of worlds, and rulers of reality—these are the gods and 
goddesses of the world. They have existed for eons. The countless worlds of the Great Beyond are their playgrounds and battlefields. Yet for all their vast 
power, it is not the gods of Golarion who shape nations and write history—this task falls instead to their greatest creations: the mortal races of the world. It is through their priests and paladins, their clerics and cultists that the gods make their will known in this world, be it for good or ill.
In Gods and Magic, you will learn not only of the core twenty 
deities of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, but of a multitude of other deities whose flocks, while smaller and more isolated, have just as much potential for greatness. Yet this book isn’t just for clerics—religion and faith are important factors in the lives of many, be they stalwart paladins, brave rangers, mysterious druids, or dedicated monks. Even those whose talents lie beyond the divine, such as the scholarly wizard or the god-fearing barbarian, find that faith has its advantages.
Within the pages of this book you will find:
•	 Detailed	descriptions	of 	the	core	twenty 	deities	
of the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, 
complete with symbol and full illustrations.
•	 Details	on	over	40	additional	deities, 	
including the gods of dwarves and elves, gnomes and halflings, giants and dragons, and more!
•	 Over	20	new 	spells	associated	with	the	
most powerful religions, yet usable by both arcane and divne spellcasters.
•	 Dozens	of 	new	magic	items	keyed	to	the	
world’s religions, ranging from minor trinkets to powerful artifacts.Immort al Power LIes WIthIn!
