Other Gods
Pathfinder Chronicles: Gods and Magic
The deities listed earlier represent the 20 gods and 
goddesses whose faith has most widely spread throughout Avistan and Garund, but there are 
dozens more who only have a local following, are worshiped by only a single race, or have a tiny number of worshipers. Others are widely worshiped in distant lands but have little inf luence in the lands along the Inner Sea. Some are the last vestiges of a dead god’s power, some are famous heroes whose mortal fans have elevated them to near-divinity, and some are powerful extraplanar entities who possess god-like abilities but are not actually true gods. To most mortals, the distinction between these levels of power is irrelevant—the test is whether or not they answer prayers.
This chapter describes many of these lesser known 
gods in more detail. Although these other gods aren’t as well-known throughout the Inner Sea region, they are still powerful. Clerics or other divine spellcasters may choose any of them as a patron deity without affecting their power level—a priest of Ghlaunder at 20th level is just as powerful as a priest of Torag at 20th level. The main difference is in terms of roleplaying; while the gods of the previous chapter have many worshipers in these lands, a priest of one of the gods in this chapter is less likely to be able to find a shrine, temple, or even other members of his faith. Others may believe your character’s religion is a mere cult, a new name for a better-known deity, or even a false faith. Some of these deities (particularly those mentioned in the Common Gods section) are described in the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting ; rather than 
reprinting those descriptions, their entries here only clarify or expand upon them.
