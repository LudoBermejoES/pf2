00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,479
although not specifically mentioned in
the section on counteracting I think it

484
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:53,489
the section on counteracting I think it
 

485
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,129
the section on counteracting I think it
would be reasonable for the GM to rule

486

would be reasonable for the GM to rule
 

487

would be reasonable for the GM to rule
that the trap is triggered and goes off

488
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:57,239
that the trap is triggered and goes off
 

489
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,210
that the trap is triggered and goes off
when you critically fail a counter act

490
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,220
when you critically fail a counter act
 

491
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,030
when you critically fail a counter act
check using dispel magic just like when

check using dispel magic just like when
you critically fail to disable device

you critically fail to disable device
 

495
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,580
you critically fail to disable device
using thievery

00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:06,590
using thievery
 

497
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,980

instead of a stealth DC and then leaves

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:02,880
instead of a stealth DC and then leaves
it to the GM to calculate the stealth DC

752
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:02,890
it to the GM to calculate the stealth DC
 

753
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,380
it to the GM to calculate the stealth DC
which is 10 plus the stealth bonus

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,390
which is 10 plus the stealth bonus
 

755
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,360
which is 10 plus the stealth bonus
therefore this trap can only be detected

therefore this trap can only be detected
if a character with at least expert

however this one is a little extra

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:20,199
however this one is a little extra
 

765
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,199
however this one is a little extra
tricky because it shows not only a

stealth bonus but also a stealth DC of
 

769
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,270
stealth bonus but also a stealth DC of
31 Master so in this case it takes a

to actually disable this trap you would
need to make a perception check with

need to make a perception check with

effects occur now if you're wondering
 

805
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,500
effects occur now if you're wondering
how a creature can end its turn in the

hallway without first entering that
 

809

hallway save that thought and I promise

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,790
hallway save that thought and I promise
we will get to that before we're done

812
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:30,800
we will get to that before we're done
 

813
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,820
we will get to that before we're done
here anyway once the trap is triggered

814
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:33,830
here anyway once the trap is triggered
 

815
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,480
here anyway once the trap is triggered
we look at the effect the trap makes a

816
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:37,490
we look at the effect the trap makes a
 

817
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,370
we look at the effect the trap makes a
poison dart strike against the

818
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,380
poison dart strike against the
 

819
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,440
poison dart strike against the
triggering creature and then rolls

820
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,450
triggering creature and then rolls
 

821
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,200
triggering creature and then rolls
initiative and this is the biggest

822
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,210
initiative and this is the biggest
 

823
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,720
initiative and this is the biggest
difference between simple and complex

difference between simple and complex
 

825
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,630
difference between simple and complex
hazards when a simple hazard like a

826
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:49,640
hazards when a simple hazard like a
 

827
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,300
hazards when a simple hazard like a
poison block is triggered it is one and

828
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,310
poison block is triggered it is one and
 

829
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,870
poison block is triggered it is one and
done but when a complex trap like here

830
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:55,880
done but when a complex trap like here
 

831
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,590
done but when a complex trap like here
when it's triggered it persists when

when it's triggered it persists when
 

833
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,660
when it's triggered it persists when
this happens the GM rolls the trapped

834
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:01,670
this happens the GM rolls the trapped
 

835
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,210
this happens the GM rolls the trapped
stealth bonus of plus sixteen for its

in encounter mode then the poison dart
 

841
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,940

players were not already in encounter
 

847
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,120
players were not already in encounter
mode then they need to roll initiative -

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,130
mode then they need to roll initiative -
 

849
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,510

another dart at them so if they take

another dart at them so if they take
 

897

three actions while inside the gallery
then this hazard attacks them three

900

then this hazard attacks them three
 

901
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,650

in this video we discussed hazards

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:07,850
in this video we discussed hazards
 

965
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,820
in this video we discussed hazards
hazards are dangers in the game other

966
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,830
hazards are dangers in the game other
 

967
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,610
hazards are dangers in the game other
than creatures and typically fall into

968
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:13,620
than creatures and typically fall into
 

969
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,399
than creatures and typically fall into
one of three categories environmental

970
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:16,409
one of three categories environmental
 

971
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,120
one of three categories environmental
hazards like storms and earthquakes

972
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,130
hazards like storms and earthquakes
 

973
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,860
hazards like storms and earthquakes
hauntings like a haunted mansion or a

hauntings like a haunted mansion or a
ghost ship and traps and hazards are

976
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,130
ghost ship and traps and hazards are
 

977
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,149
ghost ship and traps and hazards are
further divided into two types simple

978
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:29,159
further divided into two types simple
 

979
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,990
further divided into two types simple
hazards and complex hazards simple

980
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,000
hazards and complex hazards simple
 

981
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,060
hazards and complex hazards simple
hazards are triggered once and then

982
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,070
hazards are triggered once and then
 

983
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,080
hazards are triggered once and then
become inert unless they are reset again

984
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,090
become inert unless they are reset again
 

985
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,120
become inert unless they are reset again
complex hazards persist after they are

986
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,130
complex hazards persist after they are
 

987
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,549
complex hazards persist after they are
triggered they are placed in iniciative
