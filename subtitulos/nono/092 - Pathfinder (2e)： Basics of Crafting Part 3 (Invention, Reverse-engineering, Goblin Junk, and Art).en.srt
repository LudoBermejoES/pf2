their own formulas instead of buying

them the only real requirement worth
 

51
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,970
them the only real requirement worth
mentioning is that the formula must be

00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:01,980
mentioning is that the formula must be
 

53
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,570
mentioning is that the formula must be
for a common rarity item there are no

for a common rarity item there are no
 

55
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,480
for a common rarity item there are no
other hard requirements but I think a GM

56
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,490
other hard requirements but I think a GM
 

57
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,310
other hard requirements but I think a GM
would be within the right to say that

58
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
would be within the right to say that
 

59
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,529
would be within the right to say that
you can only create a formula for

60
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:12,539
you can only create a formula for
 

61
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,090
you can only create a formula for
something that you can actually craft

62
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,100
something that you can actually craft
 

63
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,790
something that you can actually craft
for example you would need the magical

64
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:16,800
for example you would need the magical
 

65
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,279
for example you would need the magical
crafting feat to create the formula for

00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:19,289
crafting feat to create the formula for
 

67
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,249
crafting feat to create the formula for
a magic potion again that is not a

strict rules as written interpretation

70
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:24,899
strict rules as written interpretation
 

71
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:27,080
strict rules as written interpretation
but as a GM I just think that that is

72
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,090
but as a GM I just think that that is
 

73
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,320
but as a GM I just think that that is
logical also crafting the formula works

74
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,330
logical also crafting the formula works
 

75
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,990
logical also crafting the formula works
just like crafting anything else you pay

76
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000
just like crafting anything else you pay
 

77
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,810
just like crafting anything else you pay
half the cost up front for that formula

78
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:35,820
half the cost up front for that formula
 

79
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,870
half the cost up front for that formula
and then spend 4 days working and then

80
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
and then spend 4 days working and then
 

81
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,940
and then spend 4 days working and then
you make a crafting skill check if

82
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:40,950
you make a crafting skill check if
 

83
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,770
you make a crafting skill check if
successful you can either pay their

84
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:42,780
successful you can either pay their
 

85
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,260
successful you can either pay their
balance or spend another day of downtime

86
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,270
balance or spend another day of downtime
 

87
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,270
balance or spend another day of downtime
working when the balance is reduced to

88
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
working when the balance is reduced to
 

89
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,630
working when the balance is reduced to
zero then you have a new formula the

90
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
zero then you have a new formula the
 

91
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,819
zero then you have a new formula the
other way to gain new formulas is

92
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:52,829
other way to gain new formulas is
 

93
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,030
other way to gain new formulas is
through reverse engineering this works

94
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,040
through reverse engineering this works
 

95
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,510
through reverse engineering this works
pretty much the same but in Reverse

96
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:58,520
pretty much the same but in Reverse
 

97
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,580
pretty much the same but in Reverse
instead of creating a new item you're

98
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:01,590
instead of creating a new item you're
 

99
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,859
instead of creating a new item you're
taking a part and item you already have

100
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:03,869
taking a part and item you already have
 

101
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,889
taking a part and item you already have
to see how it works and then creating a

102
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:06,899
to see how it works and then creating a
 

103
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,870
to see how it works and then creating a
formula to make that item through the

104
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:08,880
formula to make that item through the
 

105
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,660
formula to make that item through the
knives gained by taking it apart first

106
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:11,670
knives gained by taking it apart first
 

107
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,120
knives gained by taking it apart first
you spend four days disassembling and

108
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,130
you spend four days disassembling and
 

109
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,060
you spend four days disassembling and
examining that item this effectively

110
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,070
examining that item this effectively
 

111
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,400
examining that item this effectively
destroys it and leaves you with raw

112
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,410
destroys it and leaves you with raw
 

113
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,190
destroys it and leaves you with raw
materials worth 50% of the items listed

materials worth 50% of the items listed
 

115
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,099
materials worth 50% of the items listed
price after this you make a crafting

116
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:25,109
price after this you make a crafting
 

117
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,920
price after this you make a crafting
skill check vs. ADC set by the GM and

118
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:27,930
skill check vs. ADC set by the GM and
 

119
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,190
skill check vs. ADC set by the GM and
this DC should be the same DC that you

120
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
this DC should be the same DC that you
 

121
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,220
this DC should be the same DC that you
would roll against to craft that item if

122
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,230
would roll against to craft that item if
 

123
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,560
would roll against to craft that item if
you succeed you can craft the items

124
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:36,570
you succeed you can craft the items
 

125
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,530
you succeed you can craft the items

and then from there everything just

144
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,060
and then from there everything just
 

145
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,539
and then from there everything just
works as normal you can pay the

works as normal you can pay the
 

147
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,490
works as normal you can pay the
remaining balance or spend another day

of downtime working when the balance

150
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
of downtime working when the balance
 

151
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,960
of downtime working when the balance
reaches zero then you have a formula for

152
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:08,970
reaches zero then you have a formula for
 

153
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,750
reaches zero then you have a formula for
the original item and then if you want

154
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
the original item and then if you want
 

155
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,699
the original item and then if you want
you can use the formula that you just

156
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:13,709
you can use the formula that you just
 

157
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,059
you can use the formula that you just
created in order to recreate the item

158
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:17,069
created in order to recreate the item
 

159
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,369
created in order to recreate the item
that you took apart using the raw

160
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:19,379
that you took apart using the raw
 

161
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,140
that you took apart using the raw
materials that you were given when you

162
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,150
materials that you were given when you
 

163
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,729
materials that you were given when you
disassembled it these raw materials

164
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:22,739
disassembled it these raw materials
 

165
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,089
disassembled it these raw materials
again are 50% so conveniently that's the

166
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:26,099
again are 50% so conveniently that's the
 

167
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,229
again are 50% so conveniently that's the
