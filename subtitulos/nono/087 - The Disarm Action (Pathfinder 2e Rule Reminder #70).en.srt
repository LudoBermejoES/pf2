their game on this arm attempts this
 

171
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,430
their game on this arm attempts this
house rule territory but it seems to be

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
house rule territory but it seems to be
 

173
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,750
house rule territory but it seems to be
fairly popular for some of the folks who

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,789
lacking they want to beef it up a little
bit a question has come up about

184
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
bit a question has come up about
 

185
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,910
bit a question has come up about
disarming a shield uh that is a held

186
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
disarming a shield uh that is a held
 

187
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,149
disarming a shield uh that is a held
item and this arm says that you can

188
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
item and this arm says that you can
 

189
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,990
item and this arm says that you can
use it to to remove a held item but

190
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
use it to to remove a held item but
 

191
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,070
use it to to remove a held item but
there are other complications that pop

192
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
there are other complications that pop
 

193
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,949
there are other complications that pop
up when using shields and so i want to

194
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
up when using shields and so i want to
 

195
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,789
up when using shields and so i want to
walk through a couple of different

196
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
walk through a couple of different
 

197
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,470
walk through a couple of different
options and things that might occur but

198
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
options and things that might occur but
 

199
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,910
options and things that might occur but
it's ultimately going to be up to your

200
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
it's ultimately going to be up to your
 

201
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,869
it's ultimately going to be up to your
gm and how they view the usage of

202
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
gm and how they view the usage of
 

203
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,710
gm and how they view the usage of
shields in their game as to whether or

204
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
shields in their game as to whether or
 

205
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,469
shields in their game as to whether or
not each of these things apply so the

206
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
not each of these things apply so the
 

207
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,110
not each of these things apply so the
first thing to think about is the reflux

00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
first thing to think about is the reflux
 

209

first thing to think about is the reflux
dc of that shielded target uh some gm's

dc of that shielded target uh some gm's
 

211
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,350
dc of that shielded target uh some gm's
out there say that if that shield is

212
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
out there say that if that shield is
 

213
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,390
out there say that if that shield is
raised then they are going to allow the

214
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
raised then they are going to allow the
 

215
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,230
raised then they are going to allow the
bonus of that shield that usually goes

bonus of that shield that usually goes
 

217
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,870

igem might also decide that that shield

igem might also decide that that shield
 

231
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,830
igem might also decide that that shield
is strapped so firmly on the target's

is strapped so firmly on the target's
 

233
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,189
is strapped so firmly on the target's

disarm this enemy of their shield and
you roll a success what does that mean

268
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
you roll a success what does that mean
 

269
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,830

disarmed they're not able to hold it uh

disarmed they're not able to hold it uh
 

307
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,749
disarmed they're not able to hold it uh
as clear and soundly as they would

normally be able to do
 

311
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,990
normally be able to do
by raw note there's there's no penalty

312
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
by raw note there's there's no penalty
 

313
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,230
by raw note there's there's no penalty
to their armor class armor class is not

to their armor class armor class is not
 

315
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,510
to their armor class armor class is not
a check

316
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
a check
 

317
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,909
a check
it is a type of dc but it's not a check

318
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
it is a type of dc but it's not a check
 

319
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,309
it is a type of dc but it's not a check
so by raw there's no um penalty there

320
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
so by raw there's no um penalty there
 

321
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,550
so by raw there's no um penalty there

346
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
critical success what happens when
 

347
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,950
critical success what happens when
you're trying to disarm a shield

348
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
you're trying to disarm a shield
 

349
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,029
you're trying to disarm a shield
again up to the gm if they believe that

350
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
again up to the gm if they believe that
 

351
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,430
again up to the gm if they believe that
the the shield is strapped on firmly and

352
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
the the shield is strapped on firmly and
 

353
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,110
the the shield is strapped on firmly and
immune to disarm attempts then obviously

354
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
immune to disarm attempts then obviously
 

355
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,830
immune to disarm attempts then obviously
they don't drop it but the gm could also

356
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
they don't drop it but the gm could also
 

357
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,830
they don't drop it but the gm could also
rule that uh either they're not strapped

358
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
rule that uh either they're not strapped
 

359
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,670
rule that uh either they're not strapped
on the arm and therefore they do get

360
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
on the arm and therefore they do get
 

361
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,350
on the arm and therefore they do get
dropped or they can say you know what

362
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
dropped or they can say you know what
 

363
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,350
dropped or they can say you know what
