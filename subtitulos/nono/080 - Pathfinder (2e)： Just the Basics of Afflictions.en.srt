through the duration of the onset period

there are a few other special

there are a few other special
 

227
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,870
there are a few other special
circumstances that we should discuss too

228
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:09,880
circumstances that we should discuss too
 

229
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,000
circumstances that we should discuss too
for instance what happens when you're

230
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,010
for instance what happens when you're
 

231
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,680
for instance what happens when you're
exposed to an affliction while you're

232
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,690
exposed to an affliction while you're
 

233
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,600
exposed to an affliction while you're
already suffering from that same

234
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,610
already suffering from that same
 

235
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,630
already suffering from that same
affliction this is one of the rare times

236
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:18,640
affliction this is one of the rare times
 

237
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,550
affliction this is one of the rare times
where it's important to know what kind

238
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
where it's important to know what kind
 

239
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,050
where it's important to know what kind
of affliction you're dealing with if

240
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,060
of affliction you're dealing with if
 

241
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,590
of affliction you're dealing with if
it's a curse or a disease then multiple

242
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
it's a curse or a disease then multiple
 

243
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,890
it's a curse or a disease then multiple
exposures have no effect but if it's a

244
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:28,900
exposures have no effect but if it's a
 

245
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,070
exposures have no effect but if it's a
poison then multiple exposures require a

246
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
poison then multiple exposures require a
 

247
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
poison then multiple exposures require a
new savings throw for each exposure and

248
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,570
new savings throw for each exposure and
 

249
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,440
new savings throw for each exposure and
if you fail you'll lose the current

250
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,450
if you fail you'll lose the current
 

251
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,960
if you fail you'll lose the current
stage and gain one higher or on a

252
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:39,970
stage and gain one higher or on a
 

253
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,210
stage and gain one higher or on a
critical fail you lose the current stage

254
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,220
critical fail you lose the current stage
 

255
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,000
critical fail you lose the current stage
and gain the stage to higher we should

256
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,010
and gain the stage to higher we should
 

257
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,980
and gain the stage to higher we should
also talk about the conditions you

258
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:46,990
also talk about the conditions you
 

259
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,010
also talk about the conditions you
receive from afflictions if you are able

260
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,020
receive from afflictions if you are able
 

261
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,460
receive from afflictions if you are able
to remove that specific condition while

262
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,470
to remove that specific condition while
 

263
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,830
to remove that specific condition while
under the effects of the affliction just

264
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
under the effects of the affliction just
 

265
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,740
under the effects of the affliction just
be aware that removing the condition has

266
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:58,750
be aware that removing the condition has
 

267
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,010
be aware that removing the condition has
no effect on the affliction so say an

268
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,020
no effect on the affliction so say an
 

269
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,390
no effect on the affliction so say an
affliction gives you the second

270
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,400
affliction gives you the second
 

271
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,700
affliction gives you the second
condition and you remove the second

272
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:05,710
condition and you remove the second
 

273
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,310
condition and you remove the second
condition by retching then it only

274
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,320
condition by retching then it only
 

275
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,340
condition by retching then it only
removes that one condition and has no

276
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,350
removes that one condition and has no
 

277
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,530
removes that one condition and has no
effect on the affliction that caused

278
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:13,540
effect on the affliction that caused
 

279
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,140
effect on the affliction that caused
sickened the affliction continues as

280
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,150
sickened the affliction continues as
 

281
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,750
sickened the affliction continues as
normal and the opposite of that is also

282
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:18,760
normal and the opposite of that is also
 

283
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,870
normal and the opposite of that is also
true curing an affliction does not

true curing an affliction does not
 

285
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,900
true curing an affliction does not
necessarily cure the conditions that the

286
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,910
necessarily cure the conditions that the
 

287
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,570
necessarily cure the conditions that the
affliction caused if you suffer a

affliction caused if you suffer a
 

289
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,810
affliction caused if you suffer a

maximum duration of the affliction that
 

295

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,120
caused it then that condition persists
even after the affliction goes away and

even after the affliction goes away and
 

299
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,130

the last special circumstance I want to

are especially nasty afflictions that

are especially nasty afflictions that
 

305
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,950
are especially nasty afflictions that
operate the same way as normal

consecutive successes to remove the

current stage and gain one stage lower
 

313
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,470
current stage and gain one stage lower
or one critical success gains one stage
