that's two

104
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
that's two
 

105
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,550
that's two
for being trained plus two more for

and finally plus one more for your

110
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
and finally plus one more for your
 

111
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,749
and finally plus one more for your

112
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759

although a dexterity score 14 has a

although a dexterity score 14 has a
 

115
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,830

117
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,950
modifier of plus
two we see here that chainmail

118
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
two we see here that chainmail
 

119
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,990
two we see here that chainmail
has a dexcap of plus one

120
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
has a dexcap of plus one
 

121
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,230
has a dexcap of plus one
meaning that's the highest bonus you can

122
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
meaning that's the highest bonus you can
 

123
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,590
meaning that's the highest bonus you can
receive for dexterity

124
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
receive for dexterity
 

125
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,229
receive for dexterity
so in this case it's a plus one instead

126
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
so in this case it's a plus one instead
 

127
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,150
so in this case it's a plus one instead
of the plus two you usually get

128
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
of the plus two you usually get
 

129
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,190
of the plus two you usually get
for a dexterity of fourteen so

130
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
for a dexterity of fourteen so
 

131
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,309
for a dexterity of fourteen so
ten plus four plus four for proficiency

132
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
ten plus four plus four for proficiency
 

133
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,949
ten plus four plus four for proficiency
and plus one for dexterity equals an

134
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
and plus one for dexterity equals an
 

135
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,150
and plus one for dexterity equals an
armor class score of nineteen

136
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
armor class score of nineteen
 

137
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,550
armor class score of nineteen
if you're not wearing armor then your ac

138
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
if you're not wearing armor then your ac
 

139
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,309
if you're not wearing armor then your ac
is calculated the same way

140
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
is calculated the same way
 

141
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,030
is calculated the same way
but with no ac bonus provided by armor

142
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
but with no ac bonus provided by armor
 

143
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,430
but with no ac bonus provided by armor
and

144
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
and
 

145
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,190
and
you use your unarmored defense

146
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
you use your unarmored defense
 

147
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,630

159
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,990
does impose a deck's cap of plus 5
so you may be wondering why you would

160
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
so you may be wondering why you would
 

161
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,990
so you may be wondering why you would
want to wear explorer's clothing in the

first place
 

165
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,589
first place
and the answer to that is because of

166
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
and the answer to that is because of
 

167
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,270
and the answer to that is because of
runes

168
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280

169
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,430
