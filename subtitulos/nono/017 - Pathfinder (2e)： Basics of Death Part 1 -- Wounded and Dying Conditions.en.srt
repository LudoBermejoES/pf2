00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,440
irrelevant but if the attack is a
critical hit then the value of the dying

critical hit then the value of the dying

then you lose the dying condition and

then you lose the dying condition and
 

215
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,890
then you lose the dying condition and
stabilize your still unconscious and

216

stabilize your still unconscious and
 

217
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,800
stabilize your still unconscious and
have zero hit points but you do not need

have zero hit points but you do not need
 

219
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,930
have zero hit points but you do not need
to make any more recovery checks at the

00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
to make any more recovery checks at the
 

221
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,240

start of your turn unless you suffer
 

223
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,760
start of your turn unless you suffer
more damage and therefore regain the

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:01,770
more damage and therefore regain the
 

225
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,850
more damage and therefore regain the
dying condition again if that happens

226
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:04,860
dying condition again if that happens
 

227
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,380
dying condition again if that happens
you start the process all over again

228
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:06,390
you start the process all over again
 

229
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,230
you start the process all over again
which means you will skip past dying 1

230
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,240
which means you will skip past dying 1
 

231
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,450
which means you will skip past dying 1
because you now have the wounded

condition

234

235
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,580

anytime you lose the dying condition the

236
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,590
anytime you lose the dying condition the
 

237
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,439
anytime you lose the dying condition the
value of your wounded condition

238
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,449
value of your wounded condition
 

239
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,499
value of your wounded condition
increases by one so if you're dying in

240
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:22,509
increases by one so if you're dying in
 

241
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,689
increases by one so if you're dying in
someone cast a healing spell on you you

242
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:24,699
someone cast a healing spell on you you
 

243
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,820
someone cast a healing spell on you you
lose the dying condition but you gain

244
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:26,830
lose the dying condition but you gain
 

245
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,059
lose the dying condition but you gain
wounded one the next time that happens

246
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:30,069
wounded one the next time that happens
 

247
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,050
wounded one the next time that happens
it increases two wounded two and so on

248
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,060
it increases two wounded two and so on
 

249
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,119
it increases two wounded two and so on
anytime you gain the dying condition you

250
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:36,129
anytime you gain the dying condition you
 

251
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,149
anytime you gain the dying condition you
increase its value by the value of your

252
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:39,159
increase its value by the value of your
 

253
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,429
increase its value by the value of your
wounded condition so if you get in a

254
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:41,439
wounded condition so if you get in a
 

255
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,439
wounded condition so if you get in a
fight and you're reduced to zero hit

256
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:43,449
fight and you're reduced to zero hit
 

257
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,989
fight and you're reduced to zero hit
points you gain the dying one condition

258
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:45,999
points you gain the dying one condition
 

259
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,140
points you gain the dying one condition
then someone heals you which removes the

260
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,150
then someone heals you which removes the
 

261
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,719
then someone heals you which removes the
dying one and unconscious conditions but

262
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:51,729
dying one and unconscious conditions but
 

263
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,439
dying one and unconscious conditions but
you gain wounded one a few rounds later

264
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:55,449
you gain wounded one a few rounds later
 

265
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,659
you gain wounded one a few rounds later
you get reduced to zero hit points again

266
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:57,669
you get reduced to zero hit points again
 

267
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,800
you get reduced to zero hit points again
you're knocked out and gain dying too

268
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:00,810
you're knocked out and gain dying too
 

269
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,300
you're knocked out and gain dying too
because whenever you gain the dying

270
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,310
because whenever you gain the dying
 

271
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,629
because whenever you gain the dying
condition its value is 1 plus the value

272
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
condition its value is 1 plus the value
 

273
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,089
condition its value is 1 plus the value
of your wounded condition and one more

274
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:09,099
of your wounded condition and one more
 

275
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,800
of your wounded condition and one more
if is a critical hit or if you

276
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:10,810
if is a critical hit or if you
 

277
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,679
if is a critical hit or if you
critically fail to save will say the

278
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:13,689
critically fail to save will say the
 

279
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,959
critically fail to save will say the
clerk heals you again which removes

280
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:15,969
clerk heals you again which removes
 

281
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,260
clerk heals you again which removes
dying too but increases your wounded

282
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,270
dying too but increases your wounded
 

283
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,619
dying too but increases your wounded
condition to wounded to the next time

284
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:22,629
condition to wounded to the next time
 

285
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,290
condition to wounded to the next time
you get knocked out you start at dying 3

286
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,300
you get knocked out you start at dying 3
 

287
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,200
you get knocked out you start at dying 3
and so on

288
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,210
and so on
 

289
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,550
and so on
fortunately there are a couple of ways

290
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,560
fortunately there are a couple of ways
 

291
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,219
fortunately there are a couple of ways
to remove the wounded condition although

292
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:32,229
to remove the wounded condition although
 

293
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,649
to remove the wounded condition although
you can't really do so in the heat of a

294
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:34,659
you can't really do so in the heat of a
 

295
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,769
you can't really do so in the heat of a
battle the first is by being healed to

296
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:37,779
battle the first is by being healed to
 

297
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,800
battle the first is by being healed to
your maximum hit point and then spending

298
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:40,810
your maximum hit point and then spending
 

299
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,279
your maximum hit point and then spending
10 minutes of rest afterwards you lose

300
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,289
10 minutes of rest afterwards you lose
 

301
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,040
10 minutes of rest afterwards you lose
your entire wounded value and are

302
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,050
your entire wounded value and are
 

303
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,459
your entire wounded value and are
effectively reset to wounded zero the

304
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:50,469
effectively reset to wounded zero the
 

305
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,469
effectively reset to wounded zero the
second way to lose the wounded condition

00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
second way to lose the wounded condition
 

307
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,320
second way to lose the wounded condition
is through the treat wounds application
