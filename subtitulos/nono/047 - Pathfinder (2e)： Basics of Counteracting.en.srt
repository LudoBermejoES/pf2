have to ask yourself do I have enough

blocks but if it is not then there are a
 

819
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,820
blocks but if it is not then there are a
couple ways to calculate it first if a

820
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:34,830
couple ways to calculate it first if a
 

821
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,310
couple ways to calculate it first if a
spell is being used its counteract level

822
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
spell is being used its counteract level
 

823
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,340
spell is being used its counteract level
is equal to that spells spell level and

824
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,350
is equal to that spells spell level and
 

825
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,130
is equal to that spells spell level and
if an item is being used you can

826
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,140
if an item is being used you can
 

827
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,620
if an item is being used you can
calculate as counter at level as one

828
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:45,630
calculate as counter at level as one
 

829
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,580
calculate as counter at level as one
half of its item level rounded up if the

830
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:49,590
half of its item level rounded up if the
 

831
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,919
half of its item level rounded up if the
counter act check is equal to or higher

832
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:51,929
counter act check is equal to or higher
 

833
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,370
counter act check is equal to or higher
than the counter act DC then it negates

834
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,380
than the counter act DC then it negates
 

835
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,740
than the counter act DC then it negates
the targeted effect as long as the

if the counter I check is a critical
success then it negates the targets

844
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
success then it negates the targets
 

845
