animal has an attitude of unfriendly or
 

75
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,219
animal has an attitude of unfriendly or

bit differently than regular animals the
 

85
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,200
bit differently than regular animals the
first difference is that the mount acts

first difference is that the mount acts
 

87
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,109
