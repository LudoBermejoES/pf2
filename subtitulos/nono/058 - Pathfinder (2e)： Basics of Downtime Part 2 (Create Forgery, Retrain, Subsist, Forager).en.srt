official looking document they can do so
 

27
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,560
official looking document they can do so
with their downtime first you have to

28
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:35,570
with their downtime first you have to

access to all of the common-sense
 

35
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,500
access to all of the common-sense

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,980
situation if you haven't just seen the
document before but actually have the

document before but actually have the
 

65
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,630

forgery
 

69
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,240
forgery
then the GM will likely give you a bonus

70
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,250
then the GM will likely give you a bonus
 

71
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,609
then the GM will likely give you a bonus
for that but the GM will also impose

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:30,619
for that but the GM will also impose
 

73
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,340
for that but the GM will also impose
penalties as they deem appropriate for

penalties as they deem appropriate for
 

75
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,590
penalties as they deem appropriate for
example if the forgery requires a

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
example if the forgery requires a
 

77
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,350
example if the forgery requires a
specific person signature then they will

78
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,360
specific person signature then they will
 

79
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,200
specific person signature then they will
raise the DC and also require that you

80
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,210
raise the DC and also require that you
 

81
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,030
raise the DC and also require that you
have a copy of that person's actual

82
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
have a copy of that person's actual
 

83
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,039
have a copy of that person's actual
signature as you attempt to make the

84
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,049
signature as you attempt to make the
 

85
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,880
signature as you attempt to make the
forgery if you fail this check then the

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:48,890
forgery if you fail this check then the
 

87
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,490
forgery if you fail this check then the
forgery can be spotted by passive

88
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:51,500
forgery can be spotted by passive
 

89
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,010
forgery can be spotted by passive
observers anyone who looks at the

90
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,020
observers anyone who looks at the
 

91
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,499
observers anyone who looks at the
forgery regardless of if they're just

92
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:56,509
forgery regardless of if they're just
 

93
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,210
forgery regardless of if they're just
glancing at it or if they're really

00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,220
glancing at it or if they're really
 

95
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,700
glancing at it or if they're really
checking it hard they will have the hire

96
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:00,710
checking it hard they will have the hire
 

97
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,550
checking it hard they will have the hire
of either their perception DC or their

98
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,560
of either their perception DC or their
 

99
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,310
of either their perception DC or their
Society DC compared to that Society

100
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
Society DC compared to that Society
 

101
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,560
Society DC compared to that Society
check that the GM rolled in secret when

102
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,570
check that the GM rolled in secret when
 

103
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,289
check that the GM rolled in secret when
making the document as a reminder a

00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:11,299
making the document as a reminder a
 

105
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,960
making the document as a reminder a
skilled EC is just ten plus their bonus

106
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:13,970
skilled EC is just ten plus their bonus
 

107
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,960
skilled EC is just ten plus their bonus
so if a character has a society skill

108
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:16,970
so if a character has a society skill
 

109
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,350
so if a character has a society skill
bonus of plus nine then their society DC

110
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,360
bonus of plus nine then their society DC
 

111
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,830
bonus of plus nine then their society DC
will be 19 and if either of their

112
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
will be 19 and if either of their
 

113
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,069
will be 19 and if either of their
perception DC or Society DC is higher

114
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:27,079
perception DC or Society DC is higher
 

115
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,319
perception DC or Society DC is higher
than that total of the Society skill

116
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,329
than that total of the Society skill
 

117
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,910
than that total of the Society skill
check that it was rolled with making the

118
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:30,920
check that it was rolled with making the
 

119
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,130
check that it was rolled with making the
document then they're going to realize

120
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,140
document then they're going to realize
 

121
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,589
document then they're going to realize
that they are looking at a fake

122
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
that they are looking at a fake
 

123
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,839
that they are looking at a fake
that's what happens when you fail the

124
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:37,849
that's what happens when you fail the
 

125
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,140
that's what happens when you fail the
original skill check but if you succeed

126
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,150
original skill check but if you succeed
 

127
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,750
original skill check but if you succeed
then passive observers can never spot

128
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
then passive observers can never spot
 

129
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,179
then passive observers can never spot
the fake no matter how high their

130
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:46,189
the fake no matter how high their
 

131
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,690
the fake no matter how high their
perception DC or society DC's are

perception DC or society DC's are
 

133
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,970
perception DC or society DC's are
however this how it works for passive

134
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:51,980
however this how it works for passive
 

135
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,059
however this how it works for passive
observers but active observers will

136
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:55,069
observers but active observers will
 

137
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,520
