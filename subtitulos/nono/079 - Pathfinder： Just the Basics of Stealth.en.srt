are two exceptions to this and the first

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,230
are two exceptions to this and the first
 

189
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,190
are two exceptions to this and the first
of those is the strike action if you

190
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,200
of those is the strike action if you
 

191
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,320
of those is the strike action if you
strike a target while hidden from them

192

strike a target while hidden from them
 

193

you resolve the attack first and don't

is rolled this means the target is still

198
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:15,660
is rolled this means the target is still
 

199
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,110
is rolled this means the target is still
flat-footed for the attack and therefore

200
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,120
flat-footed for the attack and therefore
 

201
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,940
flat-footed for the attack and therefore
the attacker can use abilities like

202
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:19,950
the attacker can use abilities like
 

203
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,160
the attacker can use abilities like
sneak attack with their strike action

204
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,170
sneak attack with their strike action
 

205
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,400

but once the attack is resolved the
