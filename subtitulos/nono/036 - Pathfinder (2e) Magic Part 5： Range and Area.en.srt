so a 5 foot burst is the same as a 2

68
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
so a 5 foot burst is the same as a 2

something like this

80
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
something like this
 

81
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,990
something like this
if you select an intersection and then

82
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
if you select an intersection and then
 

83
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,109

all squares within 10 feet of that point

count as 10 feet

88

count as 10 feet
 

89
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,390
count as 10 feet
so a 10 foot burst will not hit a target

90
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
so a 10 foot burst will not hit a target
 

91

so a 10 foot burst will not hit a target
that is two squares away diagonally

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,070
so let's just illustrate that with a
quick example

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
quick example
 

181
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,630

many as possible with burning hands
 

187
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,589
many as possible with burning hands
which is a 15 foot cone

188
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
which is a 15 foot cone
 

189
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,750
which is a 15 foot cone
his first option is to draw the cone

190
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
his first option is to draw the cone
 

191
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,869
his first option is to draw the cone
diagonally

192
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
diagonally
 

193
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,710

in this case he will choose one of the

194
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
in this case he will choose one of the
 

195
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,110
in this case he will choose one of the
corners of the square he occupies

corners of the square he occupies
 

197
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,309

way to think of this

204
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
way to think of this
 

205
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,509
way to think of this
is if you're making a 15 foot cone 15

206
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
is if you're making a 15 foot cone 15
 

207
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,030
is if you're making a 15 foot cone 15
feet is three squares

208
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
feet is three squares
 

209
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,630
feet is three squares
so draw two three square lines at a 90

210
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
so draw two three square lines at a 90
 

211
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,630
so draw two three square lines at a 90
degree angle from your selected corner

and then fill in the middle square so
 

217
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,309
and then fill in the middle square so
that all squares within 15 feet of the

218
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
that all squares within 15 feet of the

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,470
that all squares within 15 feet of the
point of origin in that direction are

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,469
from the starting square
and then you connect those squares with

and then you connect those squares with
 

353
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,469

in my opinion as long as each square in

394
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
in my opinion as long as each square in
 

395
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,029
in my opinion as long as each square in
the line is connected

396
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
the line is connected
 

397
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,029
the line is connected
and each square is further from the

398
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039

starting square and

400
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
starting square and
 

401
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,790
starting square and
closer to the final square then it's

402
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
closer to the final square then it's
 

403
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,469
closer to the final square then it's
probably going to be a legal
