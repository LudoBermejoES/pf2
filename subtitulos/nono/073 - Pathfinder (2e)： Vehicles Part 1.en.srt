515
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,270
first up is board simply put you spend
one action to get onto

516
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
one action to get onto
 

517
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,830
one action to get onto
or off of a vehicle if the vehicle is in

518
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
or off of a vehicle if the vehicle is in
 

519
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,390
or off of a vehicle if the vehicle is in
motion

520
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
motion
 

521
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,550
motion
then this calls for an acrobatics or

522
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
then this calls for an acrobatics or
 

523
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,670
then this calls for an acrobatics or
athletics check

524
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
athletics check
 

525
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,029
athletics check
against the vehicle's armor class next

526
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
against the vehicle's armor class next
 

527
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,510
against the vehicle's armor class next
is the drive action which is how you

528
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
is the drive action which is how you
 

529
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,950
is the drive action which is how you
make the vehicle move

530
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
make the vehicle move
 

531
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,190
make the vehicle move
each turn the pilot will decide how many

532
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
each turn the pilot will decide how many
 

533
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,790
each turn the pilot will decide how many
of their actions they wish to invest in

534
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
of their actions they wish to invest in
 

535
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,310
of their actions they wish to invest in
controlling the vehicle

536
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
controlling the vehicle
 

537
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,469
controlling the vehicle
for a one action the pilot rolls their

538
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
for a one action the pilot rolls their
 

539
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,389
for a one action the pilot rolls their
check and on its success the vehicle

540
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
check and on its success the vehicle
 

541
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,070
check and on its success the vehicle
moves up to its speed

542
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
moves up to its speed
 

543
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,790
moves up to its speed
and turns normally on a failure the

544
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
and turns normally on a failure the
 

545
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,110

it gains the reckless trait meaning the

it gains the reckless trait meaning the
 

571
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,949
it gains the reckless trait meaning the
pilot needs to pass a piloting check

before they can resolve this action as

if the pilot spends three actions on

if the pilot spends three actions on
 

579
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,070
if the pilot spends three actions on
drive then they face an

drive then they face an
 

581
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,910
drive then they face an
extra piloting check due to it having

they face a negative 5 penalty to that

but if they succeed then the vehicle

we have the stop action

596
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
we have the stop action
 

597
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,150
we have the stop action
this costs one of the piles actions and

598
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
this costs one of the piles actions and
 

599
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,990
this costs one of the piles actions and
brings the vehicle to a stop

600
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
brings the vehicle to a stop
 

601
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,230
brings the vehicle to a stop
it doesn't matter how fast it was going

602
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
it doesn't matter how fast it was going
 

603
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,310
it doesn't matter how fast it was going
this will bring it to a rest

604
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
this will bring it to a rest
 

605
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,790
this will bring it to a rest
but remember a vehicle may only be used

606
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
but remember a vehicle may only be used
 

607
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,710
but remember a vehicle may only be used
for one move action per round

608
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
for one move action per round
 

609
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,630
for one move action per round
so you can't perform another vehicle

610
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
so you can't perform another vehicle
 

611
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,590
so you can't perform another vehicle
action and stop in the same round

612
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
action and stop in the same round
 

613
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,110
action and stop in the same round
and the last action we're going to

614
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
and the last action we're going to
 

615
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,870
and the last action we're going to
discuss in this video is take

616
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
discuss in this video is take
 

617
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,990
discuss in this video is take
control simply put this takes one action

618
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
control simply put this takes one action
 

619
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,670
control simply put this takes one action
and a successful potting check

620
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
and a successful potting check
 

621
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,509
and a successful potting check
and this is how you designate yourself

622
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
and this is how you designate yourself
 

623
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,829
and this is how you designate yourself
as the vehicle's pilot

624
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
as the vehicle's pilot
 

625
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,670
as the vehicle's pilot
those are all of the vehicle actions

626
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
those are all of the vehicle actions
 

627
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,030
those are all of the vehicle actions

in the next video we'll examine how
 

631
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,389
in the next video we'll examine how
vehicles function in combat

632
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
vehicles function in combat
 

633
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,430
vehicles function in combat
such as running creatures over ramming

634
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
such as running creatures over ramming
 

635
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,990
such as running creatures over ramming
collision damage attacks of opportunity
