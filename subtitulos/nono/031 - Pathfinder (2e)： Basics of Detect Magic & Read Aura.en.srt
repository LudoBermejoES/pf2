166
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:41,549
example you cast to take magic and there
 

167
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,580
example you cast to take magic and there
is an invisible creature in the room if

168
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:43,590
is an invisible creature in the room if
 

169
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,400
is an invisible creature in the room if
the effect level of that creatures and

170
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,410
the effect level of that creatures and
 

171
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,460
the effect level of that creatures and
visibility is equal to or greater than

172
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,470
visibility is equal to or greater than
 

173
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,979
visibility is equal to or greater than
the level that you cast to take magic at

174
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:51,989
the level that you cast to take magic at
 

175
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,380
the level that you cast to take magic at
then you will not detect the invisible

176
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,390
then you will not detect the invisible
 

177
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,990
then you will not detect the invisible
creature and of course there is an

178
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,000
creature and of course there is an
 

179
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,420
creature and of course there is an
exception to this rule if the source of

180
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,430
exception to this rule if the source of
 

181
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,059
exception to this rule if the source of
the illusion magic is an item and that

182
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:02,069
the illusion magic is an item and that
 

183
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,670
the illusion magic is an item and that
item is not using illusion magic to hide

184
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:04,680
item is not using illusion magic to hide
 

185
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,880
item is not using illusion magic to hide
its appearance then it will register

186
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:07,890
its appearance then it will register
 

187
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,280
its appearance then it will register
with the tag magic regardless of its

188
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,290
with the tag magic regardless of its
 

189
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,130
with the tag magic regardless of its
level just like any other item so for

190
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,140
level just like any other item so for
 

191
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,159
level just like any other item so for
example a wand of GU sound it has an

192
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:16,169
example a wand of GU sound it has an
 

193
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,500
example a wand of GU sound it has an
illusion aura because ghosts sound is an

194
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:18,510
illusion aura because ghosts sound is an
 

195
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,289
illusion aura because ghosts sound is an
illusion school spell but that would not

196
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:21,299
illusion school spell but that would not
 

197
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,120
illusion school spell but that would not
prevent the woman from being found by

198
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,130
prevent the woman from being found by
 

199
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,029
prevent the woman from being found by
the tech magic but instead think of a

200
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:26,039
the tech magic but instead think of a
 

201
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,279
the tech magic but instead think of a
sword that is under a magical effect

202
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:28,289
sword that is under a magical effect
 

203
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,129
sword that is under a magical effect
that makes a look like a common stick in

204
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:31,139
that makes a look like a common stick in
 

205
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,710
that makes a look like a common stick in
that case the sword would not be

206
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:33,720
that case the sword would not be
 

207
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,140
that case the sword would not be
registered by 2 Technic unless the

208
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,150
registered by 2 Technic unless the
 

209
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,510
registered by 2 Technic unless the
effect that hides it is a lower level

210
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
effect that hides it is a lower level
 

211
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,500
effect that hides it is a lower level
then you cast a tech magic act and the

212
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:42,510
then you cast a tech magic act and the
 

213
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,570
then you cast a tech magic act and the
second limitation to detect magic that

214
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,580
second limitation to detect magic that
 

215
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,540
second limitation to detect magic that
we need to talk about is traps when you

216
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:47,550
we need to talk about is traps when you
 

217
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,210
we need to talk about is traps when you
look at the stats for a trap you'll see

218
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,220
look at the stats for a trap you'll see
 

219
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,240
look at the stats for a trap you'll see
a line at the top with the stealth DC to

220
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,250
a line at the top with the stealth DC to

a line at the top with the stealth DC to
spot it this may or may not also include

222
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,190
spot it this may or may not also include
 

223
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,310
spot it this may or may not also include
a minimum proficiency level in

224
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
a minimum proficiency level in
 

225
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,580
a minimum proficiency level in
perception so here for example it says a

226
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:01,590
perception so here for example it says a
 

227
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,520
perception so here for example it says a
Pharaohs word trap has a stealth DC of

228
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,530
Pharaohs word trap has a stealth DC of
 

229
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,230
Pharaohs word trap has a stealth DC of
25 expert if there is any proficiency

230
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,240
25 expert if there is any proficiency
 

231
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,700
25 expert if there is any proficiency
requirement listed then it is absolutely

232
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,710
requirement listed then it is absolutely
 

233
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,940
requirement listed then it is absolutely
impossible to detect with detect magic

234
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:15,950
impossible to detect with detect magic
 

235
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,250
impossible to detect with detect magic
so in this case even if you are

236
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,260
so in this case even if you are
 

237
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,230
so in this case even if you are
legendary in spell casting and you

238
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240
legendary in spell casting and you
 

239
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,940
legendary in spell casting and you
heighten the tech magic to ninth level

240
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:22,950
heighten the tech magic to ninth level
 

241
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,990
heighten the tech magic to ninth level
this trap will still not register to

242
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,000
this trap will still not register to
 

243
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,770
this trap will still not register to
detect magic

244
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:28,780
detect magic
 

245
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,440
detect magic
a bottomless pit on the other hand has

no minimum proficiency requirement to

no minimum proficiency requirement to
notice and even goose the extra step of

250
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
notice and even goose the extra step of
 

251
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,909
notice and even goose the extra step of
specifically saying that it take magic

252
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:38,919
specifically saying that it take magic
 

253
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,850
specifically saying that it take magic
will work on it but even then the spell

254
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:41,860
will work on it but even then the spell
 

255
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,310
will work on it but even then the spell
will only tell you that there is magic

256
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
will only tell you that there is magic
 

257
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,580
will only tell you that there is magic
within 30 feet unless you heighten it to

258
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:47,590
within 30 feet unless you heighten it to
 

259
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,800
within 30 feet unless you heighten it to
fourth level it will not provide any

260
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:49,810
fourth level it will not provide any
 

261
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,100
fourth level it will not provide any
information about the traps location

262
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,110
information about the traps location
 

263
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,010
information about the traps location
so if detect magic only tells you if

264
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,020
so if detect magic only tells you if
 

265
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,309
so if detect magic only tells you if
there is magic within 30 feet of you how

266
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
there is magic within 30 feet of you how
 

267
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,830
there is magic within 30 feet of you how
do you know if something specific is

268
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:02,840
do you know if something specific is
 

269
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,980
do you know if something specific is
magical that's where you would use read

270
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:05,990
magical that's where you would use read
 

271
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,920
magical that's where you would use read
aura detect magic gives you very

272
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:08,930
aura detect magic gives you very
 

273
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,100
aura detect magic gives you very
imprecise information about a large area

274
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,110
imprecise information about a large area
 

275
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,129
imprecise information about a large area
but read aura grants specific

276
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:15,139
but read aura grants specific
 

277
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,589
but read aura grants specific
information about a single targeted

278
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:17,599
information about a single targeted
 

279
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,830
information about a single targeted
object read aura is a can trip and

280
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:20,840
object read aura is a can trip and
 

281
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,260
object read aura is a can trip and
requires one minute to cast after

282
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,270
requires one minute to cast after
 

283
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,570
requires one minute to cast after
casting it will tell you if the targeted

284
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:25,580
casting it will tell you if the targeted
 

285
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,089
casting it will tell you if the targeted
object is magical and if so you will

286
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:28,099
object is magical and if so you will
 

287
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:31,300
object is magical and if so you will
also learn is school of magic this is an

288
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,310
also learn is school of magic this is an
 

289
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,430
also learn is school of magic this is an
excellent first step in identifying

290
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
excellent first step in identifying
 

291
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,709
excellent first step in identifying
magical items since you cannot identify

292
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:35,719
magical items since you cannot identify
 

293
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,140
magical items since you cannot identify
a magic item until you know for certain

294
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,150
a magic item until you know for certain
 

295
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,959
a magic item until you know for certain
that it is magical if heightened the

296
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:40,969
that it is magical if heightened the
 

297
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:43,659
that it is magical if heightened the
third level one casting of red aura can

298
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:43,669
third level one casting of red aura can
 

299
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,730
third level one casting of red aura can
reveal information about ten different

300
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:45,740
reveal information about ten different
 

301
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,240
reveal information about ten different
objects and a sixth level it will reveal

302
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,250
objects and a sixth level it will reveal
 

303
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,580
objects and a sixth level it will reveal
information about all the objects within

304
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,590
information about all the objects within
 

305
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,490
information about all the objects within
range of the spell but note that since

306
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:54,500
range of the spell but note that since
 

307
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,100
range of the spell but note that since
you target objects with the spell you

308
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,110
you target objects with the spell you
 

309
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,409
you target objects with the spell you
have to know the objects are there

310
00:06:59,409 --> 00:06:59,419
have to know the objects are there
 

311
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,809
have to know the objects are there
before you can use read aura on them

312
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:01,819
before you can use read aura on them
 

313
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,510
before you can use read aura on them
therefore this is not a replacement for

314
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:04,520
therefore this is not a replacement for
 

315
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,820
therefore this is not a replacement for
detect magic and could it be used to

316
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:06,830
detect magic and could it be used to
 

317
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,149
detect magic and could it be used to
find a hidden magical trap and like the

318
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:10,159
find a hidden magical trap and like the
 

319
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:12,850
find a hidden magical trap and like the
tech magic read aura is also limited by

320
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:12,860
tech magic read aura is also limited by
 

321
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,640
tech magic read aura is also limited by
illusions if the illusions effect level

322
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:15,650
illusions if the illusions effect level
 

323
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,950
illusions if the illusions effect level
is equal to or higher than the level

324
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:17,960
is equal to or higher than the level
 

325
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,409
is equal to or higher than the level
that read aura is cast at then it does

326
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:20,419
that read aura is cast at then it does
 

327
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,990
that read aura is cast at then it does
not reveal any information to the caster

328
