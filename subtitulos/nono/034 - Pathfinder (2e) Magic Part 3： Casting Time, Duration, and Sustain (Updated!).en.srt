there are
a few questions that always seem to come

218
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
a few questions that always seem to come
 

219
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,149
a few questions that always seem to come
up the first is

220
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
up the first is
 

221
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,390
up the first is
can i sustain multiple spells at the

222
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
can i sustain multiple spells at the
 

223

same time
 

225
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,470
same time
and the answer to that is yes you can if

226
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
and the answer to that is yes you can if
 

227
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,750
and the answer to that is yes you can if
you somehow have

228
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
you somehow have
 

229
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,229
you somehow have
three active spells that all have a

230
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
three active spells that all have a
 

231
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,990
three active spells that all have a
duration of sustain

232
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
duration of sustain
 

233
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,910
duration of sustain
and have not passed their maximum

234
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
and have not passed their maximum
 

235
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,910
and have not passed their maximum
duration then you could spend

236
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
duration then you could spend
 

237
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,309
duration then you could spend
three actions and continue to sustain

238
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
three actions and continue to sustain
 

239
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,750
three actions and continue to sustain
all three of them

240
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
all three of them
 

241
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,710
all three of them
the second question is can i sustain the

242
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
the second question is can i sustain the
 

243
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,590
the second question is can i sustain the
same spell

244
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
same spell
 

245
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,150
same spell
multiple times in one round and the

246
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
multiple times in one round and the
 

247
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,990
multiple times in one round and the
answer to this is also yes

248
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
answer to this is also yes
 

249
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,469
answer to this is also yes
per the errata you can sustain spells

250

multiple times in one round
 

253
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,550
multiple times in one round
so on the round following the casting of

254
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
so on the round following the casting of
 

255
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,749
so on the round following the casting of
a sustained spell

256
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
a sustained spell

a sustained spell
you can spend three actions to sustain

258
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
you can spend three actions to sustain
 

259
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,350
you can spend three actions to sustain
the spell three times

260
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
the spell three times
 

261
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,749
the spell three times
and trigger its effects three times as

262
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
and trigger its effects three times as
 

263
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,469
and trigger its effects three times as
well

well
a good example of this would be

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
a good example of this would be
 

267
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,310
a good example of this would be
spiritual weapon where each time you
