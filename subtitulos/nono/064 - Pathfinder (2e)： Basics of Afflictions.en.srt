00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,490
affliction you attempt the listed save
if you succeed then the affliction has

if you succeed then the affliction has
no effect but if you feel it then you

some but not all afflictions have an
 

35
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,939
some but not all afflictions have an
onset period this is basically a delay

onset period this is basically a delay
 

37
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:52,029
onset period this is basically a delay
if an affliction lists an onset period

38
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:52,039
if an affliction lists an onset period
 

39
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,970
if an affliction lists an onset period
of one hour then if you fail the initial

40
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:54,980
of one hour then if you fail the initial

into an hour passes think of it as an

into an hour passes think of it as an
 

45
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,500
into an hour passes think of it as an
incubation period like when you get the

46
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,510
incubation period like when you get the
 

47
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,840
incubation period like when you get the
flu you don't start feeling the effects

48
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:04,850
flu you don't start feeling the effects
 

49
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,850
flu you don't start feeling the effects
of catching the flu for about two days

50
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:06,860
of catching the flu for about two days
 

51
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,750
of catching the flu for about two days
so the flu has an onset period of 48

52
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:10,760
so the flu has an onset period of 48
 

53
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,530
so the flu has an onset period of 48
hours but mechanically all you need to

know about onset periods is nothing

don't suffer any negative effects during

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:24,459
don't suffer any negative effects during
this period nor do you roll anymore same

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,889
set period listed then the affliction
takes effect immediately is essentially

00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,910
takes effect immediately is essentially
an onset period of zero seconds next

an onset period of zero seconds next

an onset period of zero seconds next
let's talk about stages afflictions are

78
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,070
let's talk about stages afflictions are
 

79
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,730
let's talk about stages afflictions are
divided up into a number of distinct

80
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:48,740
divided up into a number of distinct
 

81
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,109
divided up into a number of distinct
stages usually three each stage has an

82
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
stages usually three each stage has an
 

83
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,270
stages usually three each stage has an
effect listed followed by an amount of

00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
effect listed followed by an amount of
 

85
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,330
effect listed followed by an amount of
time shown in parentheses so when you

00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,340
time shown in parentheses so when you
 

87
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,940
time shown in parentheses so when you
fail the initial seems through you then

88
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:00,950
fail the initial seems through you then
 

89
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,340
fail the initial seems through you then
wait through the duration of the onset

90
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,350
wait through the duration of the onset
 

91
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,489
wait through the duration of the onset
period and once that passes you gain

92
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:06,499
period and once that passes you gain
 

93
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:09,359
period and once that passes you gain
stage one of the affliction you

94
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:09,369
stage one of the affliction you
 

95
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,830
stage one of the affliction you
immediately suffer the effects of that

96
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
immediately suffer the effects of that
 

97
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,350
immediately suffer the effects of that
stage and then treat the amount of time

1.d4 poison damage in sickened one and
in parentheses one minute then as soon

in parentheses one minute then as soon
 

109
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,690
in parentheses one minute then as soon
as you gain stage one you suffer one D

110
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:32,700
as you gain stage one you suffer one D
 

111
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,780
as you gain stage one you suffer one D
for poison damage you gain the sickened

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,300
for poison damage you gain the sickened
one condition and then nothing else

114
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,310
one condition and then nothing else
 

115
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,060
one condition and then nothing else
related to the affliction happens for

116
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,070
related to the affliction happens for
 

117
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,910
related to the affliction happens for
another minute you do not suffer a one D

118
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
another minute you do not suffer a one D
 

119
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,250
another minute you do not suffer a one D
for poison damage every round during

120
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:46,260
for poison damage every round during
 

121
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,220
for poison damage every round during
this minute nor do you continue rolling

122
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,230
this minute nor do you continue rolling
 

123
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,890
this minute nor do you continue rolling
saving throws during this time the

124
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:51,900
saving throws during this time the
 

125
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,200
saving throws during this time the
period shown in parentheses is again

126
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,210
period shown in parentheses is again
 

127
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,140
period shown in parentheses is again
sort of like the onset nothing happens

128
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,150
sort of like the onset nothing happens
 

129
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,740
sort of like the onset nothing happens
during this time but once that time is

130
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:00,750
during this time but once that time is
 

131
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,340
during this time but once that time is
up then you have to roll a new saving

132
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,350
up then you have to roll a new saving
 

133
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,850
up then you have to roll a new saving
throw if you succeed then you lose your

134
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:07,860
throw if you succeed then you lose your
 

135
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,120
throw if you succeed then you lose your
current stage and you gain one stage

136
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,130
current stage and you gain one stage
 

137
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,570
current stage and you gain one stage
lower if you fail then you lose the

138
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:14,580
lower if you fail then you lose the
 

139
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,740
lower if you fail then you lose the
current stage and gain one stage higher

140
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:17,750
current stage and gain one stage higher
 

141
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,960
current stage and gain one stage higher
so if your stage one and fail then you

142
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:20,970
so if your stage one and fail then you
 

143
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,390
so if your stage one and fail then you
become stage two when that happens you

144
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,400
become stage two when that happens you
 

145
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,810
become stage two when that happens you
suffer the listed effects of stage two

146
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:25,820
suffer the listed effects of stage two
 

147
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,490
suffer the listed effects of stage two
now that's what happens when you fail

148
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:28,500
now that's what happens when you fail
 

149
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,730
now that's what happens when you fail
the save but if you succeed then you

150
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:31,740
the save but if you succeed then you
 

151
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,280
the save but if you succeed then you
lose your current stage and gain one

152
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,290
lose your current stage and gain one
 

153
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,340
lose your current stage and gain one
stage lower and if you ever gain stage

154
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,350
stage lower and if you ever gain stage
 

155
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,800
stage lower and if you ever gain stage
zero then you're cured and the

156
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:39,810
zero then you're cured and the
 

157
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,470
zero then you're cured and the
affliction has no further effects also

158
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
affliction has no further effects also

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,780
affliction has no further effects also
is worth mentioning that critical

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,219
and that's important to know because it
informs us of what type of affliction

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,330
so if your stage 3 and fail or
critically fail your fortitude save you

critically fail your fortitude save you
 

397

ten minutes later you would still need
to roll another saving throw and if you

to roll another saving throw and if you
 

501

to roll another saving throw and if you
fail you lose stage two and gain stage

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:02,610
for example the drained condition
 

529
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,240
for example the drained condition
requires nights of rests in order to

causes you to suffer the drained
 

537
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,370
causes you to suffer the drained
condition then you will still be drained

538
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,380
condition then you will still be drained
 

539
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,920
condition then you will still be drained
after five minutes has passed and that

540
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:18,930
after five minutes has passed and that
 

541
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,980
after five minutes has passed and that
affliction has ended

542
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:20,990

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,590
and again these must be consecutive
successes you have to get two successes

successes you have to get two successes
 

565
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,049
