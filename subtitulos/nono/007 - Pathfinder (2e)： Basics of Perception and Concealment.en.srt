palm and object application of the
 

99
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,160
palm and object application of the
thievery skill so in this scenario you

100
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,170
thievery skill so in this scenario you
 

101
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,860
thievery skill so in this scenario you
would roll a thievery skill check which

102
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:14,870
would roll a thievery skill check which
 

103
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,140
would roll a thievery skill check which
would be contested by the perception

104

their modifier as being +5 and we know

112
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:30,709
their modifier as being +5 and we know
 

113
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,819
their modifier as being +5 and we know
that perception DC's are 10 plus the

114

that perception DC's are 10 plus the
 

115
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,849
that perception DC's are 10 plus the
perception modifier therefore the DC for

116
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:36,859
perception modifier therefore the DC for
 

117
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:40,599
perception modifier therefore the DC for
this check is 15 you would roll a d20

118

this check is 15 you would roll a d20
 

119
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,390
this check is 15 you would roll a d20
and add your thievery skill bonus if the

you are hiding a trinket if the total of
the fever check is 14 or lower then you

128
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:54,139
the fever check is 14 or lower then you
 

129
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,430
the fever check is 14 or lower then you
fail and they can

completely unaware that a creature or an
object is present then that creature or

object is present then that creature or
 

139
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,480

the unnoticed condition by itself does
not limit you but anytime a creature is

not limit you but anytime a creature is
unnoticed it is also undetected

times where the GM will make that role

what the total of the role is making

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,160
what the total of the role is making
this role in secret can sometimes

400
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,170
this role in secret can sometimes
 

401
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,110
this role in secret can sometimes
confuse players or even lead to

402
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
confuse players or even lead to
 

403
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,500
confuse players or even lead to
accusations of the GM quote cheating but

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,510
accusations of the GM quote cheating but
 

405
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,560
accusations of the GM quote cheating but
let me try to explain it this way in the

406
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,570
let me try to explain it this way in the
 

407
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,080
let me try to explain it this way in the
real world the results of a seek action

408
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,090
real world the results of a seek action
 

409
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,690
real world the results of a seek action
are very binary with only two outcomes

410
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:29,700
are very binary with only two outcomes
 

411
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,510
are very binary with only two outcomes
you either notice something or you do

412
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,520
you either notice something or you do
 

413
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,150
you either notice something or you do
not notice something in the real world

414
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,160
not notice something in the real world
 

415
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,550
not notice something in the real world
you don't know if you failed on a

416
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:37,560
you don't know if you failed on a
 

417
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,180
you don't know if you failed on a
perception yet to notice something so

418
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,190
perception yet to notice something so
 

419
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,400
perception yet to notice something so
let's think about how this works at the

420
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,410
let's think about how this works at the
 

421
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,800
let's think about how this works at the
game table in the real world you don't

422
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:45,810
game table in the real world you don't
 

423
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,960
game table in the real world you don't
know if you failed on a perception

424
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:47,970
know if you failed on a perception
 

425
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,730
know if you failed on a perception
can notice something because that

426
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:49,740
can notice something because that
 

427
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,640
can notice something because that
something might not actually be there to

428
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:52,650
something might not actually be there to
 

429
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,490
something might not actually be there to
be noticed in the first place let's say

430
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:55,500
be noticed in the first place let's say
 

431
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,770
be noticed in the first place let's say
the GM doesn't roll this check in secret

432
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:57,780
the GM doesn't roll this check in secret
 

433
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,050
the GM doesn't roll this check in secret
and you do it yourself like in most

434
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,060
and you do it yourself like in most
 

435
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,870
and you do it yourself like in most
checks of the game if you roll a four on

436
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
checks of the game if you roll a four on
 

437
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
checks of the game if you roll a four on
that check this tells you that you don't

438
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:05,610
that check this tells you that you don't
 

439
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,330
that check this tells you that you don't
notice anything but it also tells you

440
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:08,340
notice anything but it also tells you
 

441
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,030
notice anything but it also tells you
that you failed to check which could

442
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
that you failed to check which could
 

443
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,920
that you failed to check which could
make you even more suspicious of your

444
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:12,930
make you even more suspicious of your
 

445
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,050
make you even more suspicious of your
environment it doesn't mean there's

446
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,060
environment it doesn't mean there's
 

447
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,750
environment it doesn't mean there's
nothing hiding it only means that you

448
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
nothing hiding it only means that you
 

449
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,020
nothing hiding it only means that you
failed at spotting something and that is

450
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,030
failed at spotting something and that is
 

451
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,550
failed at spotting something and that is
more information than what you would

452
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
more information than what you would
 

453
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,580
more information than what you would
have in a real-world situation likewise

if you roll a 19 you can feel confident

456
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:28,740
if you roll a 19 you can feel confident
 

457
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,040
if you roll a 19 you can feel confident
that you succeeded on the check and not

458
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,050
that you succeeded on the check and not
 

459
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,290
that you succeeded on the check and not
only did you not notice anything but

460
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,300
only did you not notice anything but
 

461
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,080
only did you not notice anything but
your positive there is nothing hiding

your positive there is nothing hiding
 

463
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,390
your positive there is nothing hiding
there at all which can lead you to

464
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:38,400
there at all which can lead you to
 

465
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,370
there at all which can lead you to
behaving in a much more confident

466
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:40,380
behaving in a much more confident
 

467
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,930
behaving in a much more confident
approach than what you would probably

468
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:41,940
approach than what you would probably
 

469
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,930
approach than what you would probably
have in a real-world situation but when

470
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:44,940
have in a real-world situation but when
 

471
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,680
have in a real-world situation but when
the GM

makes the role for you in secret they
don't tell you what number was rolled or

476
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:50,580
don't tell you what number was rolled or
 

477
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,420
don't tell you what number was rolled or
if you succeeded or if you failed

if you succeeded or if you failed
 

479
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,390
if you succeeded or if you failed
they simply tell you if you notice

00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,400
they simply tell you if you notice
 

481
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,360
they simply tell you if you notice
something or not in a player without

is going to proceed in a more realistic
 

487
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,680
is going to proceed in a more realistic
fashion then a player who knows for

fashion then a player who knows for
 

489
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,230

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,570
bright light so for example a torch is
 

685
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,170
bright light so for example a torch is
listed as producing bright light for 20

listed as producing bright light for 20
 

687
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,500
listed as producing bright light for 20
feet therefore it also produces dim

realities in reality one the Goblin is
 

873
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,850
realities in reality one the Goblin is
hiding in the barrel which means you

874
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:23,860
hiding in the barrel which means you
 

875
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,070
hiding in the barrel which means you
missed it either the attack roll was

876
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
missed it either the attack roll was
 

877
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,350
missed it either the attack roll was
