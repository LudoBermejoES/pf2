516
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
attacks have not changed
 

517
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,149
attacks have not changed
so we calculate them as usual plus three

518
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
so we calculate them as usual plus three
 

519
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,829
so we calculate them as usual plus three
for a strength modifier

520
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
for a strength modifier
 

521
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,470
for a strength modifier
plus six for proficiency gives our

522
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
plus six for proficiency gives our
 

523
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,590
plus six for proficiency gives our
badger attack bonuses of plus nine

524
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
badger attack bonuses of plus nine
 

525
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,269
badger attack bonuses of plus nine
and we also need to adjust the hit

526
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
and we also need to adjust the hit
 

527
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,190
and we also need to adjust the hit
points again thanks to its increase in

528
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
points again thanks to its increase in
 

529
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,470

constitution

530
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
constitution
 

531
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,230
constitution
is important to remember that when

532
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
is important to remember that when
 

533
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,910
is important to remember that when
constitution increases

534
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
constitution increases
 

535
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,990
constitution increases
you calculate the character's hit points

536
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
you calculate the character's hit points
 

537
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,750
you calculate the character's hit points
as if it had always had

538
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
as if it had always had
 

539
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,990
as if it had always had
the higher constitution score

540
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
the higher constitution score
 

541
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,310
the higher constitution score
essentially making it retroactive

542
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
essentially making it retroactive
 

543
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,790
essentially making it retroactive
so the hit point calculation here is

544
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
so the hit point calculation here is
 

545
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,790
so the hit point calculation here is
eight for the hit points provided by the

546
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
eight for the hit points provided by the
 

547
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,230
eight for the hit points provided by the
badger animal type

badger animal type
 

549
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,430

and then an extra six plus three

550
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
and then an extra six plus three
 

551
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,670
and then an extra six plus three
more for the constitution modifier per

552
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
more for the constitution modifier per
 

553
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,030
more for the constitution modifier per
level gives the badger a total of 44 hit

554
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
level gives the badger a total of 44 hit
 

555
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,070

points

556

its size increases by one step if it was
