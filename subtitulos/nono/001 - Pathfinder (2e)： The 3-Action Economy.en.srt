its description which means it costs one

its description which means it costs one
action to perform and yes this does mean

that you can spend all three of your

so the strike action also has the attack

actions to spend in a turn for example
 

137
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,850
actions to spend in a turn for example
if a character is under the effects of a

haste spell so in that case if they
 

141
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,250
haste spell so in that case if they
spent all four actions on strike the

would have a negative five penalty and
both the third and the fourth strikes

both the third and the fourth strikes
 

149
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,009
both the third and the fourth strikes
would each suffer a negative 10 penalty

150
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:58,019
would each suffer a negative 10 penalty
