let's take a closer look at the two

70
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,010
let's take a closer look at the two
 

71
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,800
let's take a closer look at the two
requirements for flanking by reviewing

72
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:32,810
requirements for flanking by reviewing
 

73
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,070
requirements for flanking by reviewing
the examples in the core rulebook an

74
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,080
the examples in the core rulebook an
 

75
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,140
the examples in the core rulebook an
example 1 we have Valor Rose and Cara

76
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,150
example 1 we have Valor Rose and Cara
 

77
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,890
example 1 we have Valor Rose and Cara
battling and ogre are they flanking it

78
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:40,900
battling and ogre are they flanking it
 

79
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,480
battling and ogre are they flanking it
requirement number 1 says the ogre must

80
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,490
requirement number 1 says the ogre must
 

81
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,700
requirement number 1 says the ogre must
have enemies on opposite sides or

82
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:45,710
have enemies on opposite sides or
 

83
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,580
have enemies on opposite sides or
opposite corners if we draw an imaginary

84
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,590
opposite corners if we draw an imaginary
 

85
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,980
opposite corners if we draw an imaginary
line from the center of valor roses

86
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:50,990
line from the center of valor roses
 

87
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,040
line from the center of valor roses
Square to the center of Cairo Square we

88
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,050
Square to the center of Cairo Square we
 

89
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,320
Square to the center of Cairo Square we
see that line clearly passes through

90
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,330
see that line clearly passes through
 

91
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,680
see that line clearly passes through
opposite borders of the ogre space so

92
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,690
opposite borders of the ogre space so
 

93
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,530
opposite borders of the ogre space so
the first requirement is met and we can

94
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:02,540
the first requirement is met and we can
 

95
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,210
the first requirement is met and we can
safely assume they are both wielding

96
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:04,220
safely assume they are both wielding
 

97
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,430
safely assume they are both wielding
melee weapons so the second requirement

98
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:06,440
melee weapons so the second requirement
 

99
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,740
melee weapons so the second requirement
is met as well

100
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:07,750
is met as well
 

101
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,690
is met as well
therefore the ogre is being flanked and

102
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:10,700
therefore the ogre is being flanked and
 

103
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,240
therefore the ogre is being flanked and
does suffer a negative two penalty to

104
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,250
does suffer a negative two penalty to
 

105
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,699
does suffer a negative two penalty to
its armor class when being attacked by

106
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:15,709
its armor class when being attacked by
 

107
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,360
its armor class when being attacked by
valorous or kyra in the second example

108
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,370
valorous or kyra in the second example
 

109
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,600
valorous or kyra in the second example
mauricio closes from the north valorous

110
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:22,610
mauricio closes from the north valorous
 

111
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,060
mauricio closes from the north valorous
in Cara are flanking the ogre but what

112
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,070
in Cara are flanking the ogre but what
 

113
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,300
in Cara are flanking the ogre but what
about Marissa if we draw imaginary lines

114
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,310
about Marissa if we draw imaginary lines
 

115
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,699
about Marissa if we draw imaginary lines
from the center of her Square to the

middle of both valor Rose in kyra

118
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:32,930
middle of both valor Rose in kyra
 

119
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,860
middle of both valor Rose in kyra
squares we see that neither of those

120
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:35,870
squares we see that neither of those
 

121
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,280
squares we see that neither of those
lines pass through opposite borders or

opposite corners of the ogre and
 

125
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,820

therefore she is not flanking the ogre
 

127
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,530

creature the ogre has ten feet of reach
 

173
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,570
creature the ogre has ten feet of reach
therefore the second requirement is met

174
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,580
therefore the second requirement is met
 

175
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,660
therefore the second requirement is met
and Sione is flat-footed against both

176
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:50,670
and Sione is flat-footed against both
 

177
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,470
and Sione is flat-footed against both
the ogre and the Hobgoblin likewise we

178
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
the ogre and the Hobgoblin likewise we
 

179
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,330
the ogre and the Hobgoblin likewise we
should check to see if Sione is flanking

180
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:56,340
should check to see if Sione is flanking
 

181
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,360
should check to see if Sione is flanking
the ogre well we have Maurizio on the

182
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,370
the ogre well we have Maurizio on the
 

183
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,850
the ogre well we have Maurizio on the
ogres opposite border so that first

184
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:01,860
ogres opposite border so that first
 

185
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,190
ogres opposite border so that first
requirement is met and the second

186
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,200
requirement is met and the second
 

187
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,680
requirement is met and the second
requirement depends on what weapon Sione

188
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,690
requirement depends on what weapon Sione
 

189
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,020
requirement depends on what weapon Sione
is wielding if she's wielding a dagger

190
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,030
is wielding if she's wielding a dagger
 

191
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,530
is wielding if she's wielding a dagger
then no because a dagger can only reach

192
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:12,540
then no because a dagger can only reach
 

193
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,020
then no because a dagger can only reach
five feet away which is the adjacent

194
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,030
five feet away which is the adjacent
 

195
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,140
five feet away which is the adjacent
square but if she was wielding a long

196
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,150
square but if she was wielding a long
 

197
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,080
square but if she was wielding a long
spear then she would be flanking the

198
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,090
spear then she would be flanking the
 

199
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,260
spear then she would be flanking the
ogre because long Spears have a reach of

200
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,270
ogre because long Spears have a reach of
 

201
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,990
ogre because long Spears have a reach of
ten feet and at two vertical squares

202
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,000
ten feet and at two vertical squares
 

203
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,040
ten feet and at two vertical squares
away the ogre is ten feet away

204
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,050
away the ogre is ten feet away
 

205
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,810
away the ogre is ten feet away

their attention is split which makes it
more difficult for them to defend
