like to apply the flashlight rule which

60
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
like to apply the flashlight rule which
 

61
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,749
like to apply the flashlight rule which
says if Kyra could shine a flashlight on

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,870
there is line of effect so let's apply
that rule starting with the easy ones

68
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:19,880
that rule starting with the easy ones
 

69
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,590
that rule starting with the easy ones
valeros and marissal she easily could

70
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:22,600
valeros and marissal she easily could
 

71
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,950
valeros and marissal she easily could
shine the light on valeros and even

72
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
shine the light on valeros and even
 

73
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,749
shine the light on valeros and even
though there is a goblin between her and

obscure her her and CYO would still be

78
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:31,560
obscure her her and CYO would still be
 

79
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,069
obscure her her and CYO would still be
able to hit her with a flashlight so

80
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
able to hit her with a flashlight so
 

81
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,910
able to hit her with a flashlight so
there is line of effect to both of them

82
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,920
there is line of effect to both of them
 

83
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,590
there is line of effect to both of them
next let's consider ezin and sonone

84
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
next let's consider ezin and sonone
 

85
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,389
next let's consider ezin and sonone
those doors are open and even though it

86
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:41,399
those doors are open and even though it
 

87
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,670
those doors are open and even though it
might be difficult I believe Kyra could

88
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
might be difficult I believe Kyra could
 

89
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,670
might be difficult I believe Kyra could
shine her flashlight on both of them as

90
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
shine her flashlight on both of them as
 

91
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,469
shine her flashlight on both of them as
well so they do have line of effect too

92
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:49,479
well so they do have line of effect too

closed door Kyra could not shine a light
 

97
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,870
closed door Kyra could not shine a light
on him so there is no line of effect and

98
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
on him so there is no line of effect and
 

99
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,350
on him so there is no line of effect and
it's worth mentioning that it would not

100
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,360
it's worth mentioning that it would not
 

101
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,310
it's worth mentioning that it would not
make any difference at all if the door
