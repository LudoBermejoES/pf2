distinction here is that when someone

distinction here is that when someone
uses a scroll it is consumed and you do

216
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,190
uses a scroll it is consumed and you do
 

217
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,520
uses a scroll it is consumed and you do
not need to provide spell cost at the

not need to provide spell cost at the

stabs and wands which are not
 

223
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,500
stabs and wands which are not
consumables you do need to provide the

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,510
consumables you do need to provide the
 

225
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,680
consumables you do need to provide the
cost each time the spell is cast using

226
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:08,690
cost each time the spell is cast using
 

227
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,320
cost each time the spell is cast using
the staffer wand and therefore you do

228
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,330
the staffer wand and therefore you do
 

229
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,140

not also need to pay that spell cost
