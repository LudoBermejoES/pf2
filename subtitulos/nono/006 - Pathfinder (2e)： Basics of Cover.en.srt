both the attacker and their target then

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,970
both the attacker and their target then
the target receives the benefits of

the target receives the benefits of

then the GM may rule that they receive

then the GM may rule that they receive

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,629
then the GM may rule that they receive
no cover benefits from that object for

no cover benefits from that object for

example if a huge sized dragon is

202
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,550
example if a huge sized dragon is
 

203
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,300
example if a huge sized dragon is
standing behind a single tree the target

204
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,310
standing behind a single tree the target
 

205
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,610
standing behind a single tree the target
line might pass through that single tree

206
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,620
line might pass through that single tree
 

207
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,800
line might pass through that single tree
on the map but the GM may determine that

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:36,810
on the map but the GM may determine that
 

209
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,110
on the map but the GM may determine that
that is just not enough to provide

210
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
that is just not enough to provide
 

211
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,180
that is just not enough to provide
significant cover to the dragon and

212
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,190
significant cover to the dragon and
 

213
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,879
significant cover to the dragon and
therefore either provide less recover or

214
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:43,889
therefore either provide less recover or
 

215
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,879
therefore either provide less recover or
no cover at all

216
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:46,889
no cover at all
 

217
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,429
no cover at all
with all of that in mind let's look at a

218
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:49,439
with all of that in mind let's look at a
 

219
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,040
with all of that in mind let's look at a
few examples first we have valorous

220
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,050
few examples first we have valorous
 

221
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,589
few examples first we have valorous
fighting and over he is adjacent with

fighting and over he is adjacent with
 

223
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,899
fighting and over he is adjacent with
nothing between him and the ogre so

224
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:56,909
nothing between him and the ogre so
 

225
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:59,570
nothing between him and the ogre so
there is no cover in this situation this

226
00:04:59,570 --> 00:04:59,580
there is no cover in this situation this
 

227
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,110
there is no cover in this situation this
is a pretty simple example for the

228
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
is a pretty simple example for the
 

229
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,990
is a pretty simple example for the
second example let's consider Sione if

230
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
second example let's consider Sione if
 

231
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,879
second example let's consider Sione if
we draw a line from the center of her

232
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:07,889
we draw a line from the center of her
 

233
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,879
we draw a line from the center of her
space to the center of the ogre space we

space to the center of the ogre space we

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,890
space to the center of the ogre space we
see it does not pass through any objects

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:12,900
see it does not pass through any objects
 

237
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,020
see it does not pass through any objects
but it does pass through a creature

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,030
but it does pass through a creature
 

239
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,110
but it does pass through a creature
which is valorous and therefore the ogre

240
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,120
which is valorous and therefore the ogre
 

241
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,269
which is valorous and therefore the ogre
does receive the benefits of lesser

242

does receive the benefits of lesser
 

243
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,269
does receive the benefits of lesser
cover it doesn't matter that valorous is

think about line of effect that's an
