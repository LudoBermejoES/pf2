there are a couple of things to keep in

there are a couple of things to keep in
 

69
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,710
there are a couple of things to keep in
mind about using this

70
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
mind about using this
 

71
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,990
mind about using this
i i saw a number of people online just

72
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
i i saw a number of people online just
 

73
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,830
i i saw a number of people online just
oversimplifying this and saying if you

74
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
oversimplifying this and saying if you
 

75
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,270
oversimplifying this and saying if you
do risky surgery

76
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
do risky surgery
 

77
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,710
do risky surgery
and you get a success then instead of

78
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
and you get a success then instead of
 

79
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,830
and you get a success then instead of
worrying about 1d8 damage and 48 healing

80
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
worrying about 1d8 damage and 48 healing
 

81
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,550
worrying about 1d8 damage and 48 healing
just roll 38 healing because plus 48

82
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
just roll 38 healing because plus 48
 

83
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,350
just roll 38 healing because plus 48
healing

84
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
healing
 

85
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,390
healing
minus 1d8 damage uh gets you

86
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
minus 1d8 damage uh gets you
 

87
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,590
minus 1d8 damage uh gets you
a net result of 3d8 healing and so just

88
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
a net result of 3d8 healing and so just
 

89
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,749
a net result of 3d8 healing and so just
make life easy and roll that i would

90
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
make life easy and roll that i would
 

91
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,190
make life easy and roll that i would
recommend not doing that

92
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
recommend not doing that
 

93
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,830
recommend not doing that
and the big reason for that is if you or

94
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
and the big reason for that is if you or
 

95
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,950
and the big reason for that is if you or
your players roll

96
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
your players roll
 

97
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,350
your players roll
anything like my players do then it's

98
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
anything like my players do then it's
 

99
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,950
anything like my players do then it's
entirely possible

100
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
entirely possible
 

101
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,429
entirely possible
that you could deal 8 points of slashing

102
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
that you could deal 8 points of slashing
 

103
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,310
that you could deal 8 points of slashing
damage

104
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
damage
 

105
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,350
damage
on the 1d8 damage that you initially do

106
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
on the 1d8 damage that you initially do
 

107
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,469
on the 1d8 damage that you initially do
to the patient

108
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
to the patient
 

109
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,830
to the patient
and then roll nothing but ones on the

110
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
and then roll nothing but ones on the
 

111
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,310
and then roll nothing but ones on the
rest

112
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
rest
 

113
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,230
rest
of the healing so after all of this it

114
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
of the healing so after all of this it
 

115
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,429
of the healing so after all of this it
would still be a

116
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
would still be a
 

117
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,550
would still be a
net loss of hit points to the patient

118
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
net loss of hit points to the patient
 

119
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,710
net loss of hit points to the patient
and another question that came up was

120
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
and another question that came up was
 

121
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,949
and another question that came up was
about battle medicine can you use

122
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
about battle medicine can you use
 

123
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,750
about battle medicine can you use
risky surgery with battle medicine and

124
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
risky surgery with battle medicine and
 

125
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,869
risky surgery with battle medicine and
the answer to that is

126
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
the answer to that is
 

127
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,790
the answer to that is
no you wouldn't be able to because

128
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
no you wouldn't be able to because
 

129
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,070
no you wouldn't be able to because
battle medicine

130
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
battle medicine
 

131
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,550
battle medicine
even though it says that it uses the

132
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
even though it says that it uses the
 

133
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,589
even though it says that it uses the
same dc

134
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
same dc
 

135
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,070
same dc
as treat wounds and it heals the same

136
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
as treat wounds and it heals the same
 

137
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,830
as treat wounds and it heals the same
amount of hit points

138
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
amount of hit points
 

139
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,470
amount of hit points
as treat wounds it's pretty clear that

140
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
as treat wounds it's pretty clear that
 

141
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,270
as treat wounds it's pretty clear that
it's not

142
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
it's not
 

143
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,790
it's not
the same as tree wounds and a risky

144
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
the same as tree wounds and a risky
 

145
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,070
the same as tree wounds and a risky
surgery specifically

146
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
surgery specifically
 

147
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,869
surgery specifically
says that it applies to uses of treat

148
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
says that it applies to uses of treat
 

149
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,390
says that it applies to uses of treat
wounds so you would not be able to use

150
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
wounds so you would not be able to use
 

151
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,070
wounds so you would not be able to use
risky surgery when you're doing battle

152
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
risky surgery when you're doing battle
 

153
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,229
risky surgery when you're doing battle
medicine the next question was probably

00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
medicine the next question was probably
 

155
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,190
medicine the next question was probably
the biggest one

156
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
the biggest one
 

157
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,190
the biggest one
or the most frequent one that popped up

158
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
or the most frequent one that popped up
 

159
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,670
or the most frequent one that popped up
which was can you use assurance with

160
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
which was can you use assurance with
 

161
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,270
which was can you use assurance with
risky surgery

162

and then share you my thoughts um the
 

173
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,390
and then share you my thoughts um the
first uh

174
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
first uh
 

175
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,229
first uh
the first train of thought is that no

176
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
the first train of thought is that no
 

177
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,750
the first train of thought is that no
you cannot use

178
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
you cannot use
 

179
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,869
you cannot use
assurance with risky surgery and the

180
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
assurance with risky surgery and the
 

181
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,910
assurance with risky surgery and the
reason is

182
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
reason is
 

183
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,790
reason is
is because risky surgery uses the

184
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
is because risky surgery uses the
 

185
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,990
is because risky surgery uses the
terminology

186
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
terminology
 

187
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,750
terminology
if you roll a success okay

188
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
if you roll a success okay
 

189
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,550
if you roll a success okay
so it specifically says if you roll a

190
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
so it specifically says if you roll a
 

191
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,509
so it specifically says if you roll a
success

192
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
success
 

193
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,229
success
and the assurance fee says you can

194
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
and the assurance fee says you can
 

195
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:26,949
and the assurance fee says you can
forego

196
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
forego
 

197
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,149
forego
rolling in order to get us

198
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
rolling in order to get us
 

199
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,990
rolling in order to get us
a result so if you're foregoing

200
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
a result so if you're foregoing
 

201
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,110
a result so if you're foregoing
if you're forgoing a role and the

202
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
if you're forgoing a role and the
 

203
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,309
if you're forgoing a role and the
uh risky surgery feat specifically says

204
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
uh risky surgery feat specifically says

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:40,949
uh risky surgery feat specifically says
that

that
 

207
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,789
that
when you roll a success this is what

208
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
when you roll a success this is what
 

209
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,229
when you roll a success this is what
happens then

happens then
that school of thought is that you

212
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
that school of thought is that you
 

213
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,509
that school of thought is that you
wouldn't be able to use assurance

214
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
wouldn't be able to use assurance
 

215
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,110
wouldn't be able to use assurance
with it the other school of thought is

216
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
with it the other school of thought is
 

217
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,949
with it the other school of thought is
that the terminology is kind of loose

218
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
that the terminology is kind of loose
 

219
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,670
that the terminology is kind of loose
in pathfinder second edition that

220
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
in pathfinder second edition that
 

221
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,110
in pathfinder second edition that
rolling a success

222
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
rolling a success
 

223
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,750
rolling a success
is completely synonymous with just

224
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
is completely synonymous with just
 

225
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,670
is completely synonymous with just
performing any kind of a

226
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
performing any kind of a
 

227
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,110
performing any kind of a
check and therefore you would be able to

228
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
check and therefore you would be able to
 

229
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,750
check and therefore you would be able to
use

230
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
use
 

231
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,190
use
assurance with risky surgery

232
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
assurance with risky surgery
 

233
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,990
assurance with risky surgery
also if you the second school of thought

234
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
also if you the second school of thought
 

235
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,270
also if you the second school of thought
would say that if you

236
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
would say that if you
 

237
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,390
would say that if you
are that strict with the wording

238
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
are that strict with the wording
 

239
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,509
are that strict with the wording
of um of the feasts where it says if you

240
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
of um of the feasts where it says if you
 

241
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,870
of um of the feasts where it says if you
roll a success

242
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
roll a success
 

243
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,350
roll a success
then assurance probably wouldn't apply

244
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
then assurance probably wouldn't apply
 

245
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,150
then assurance probably wouldn't apply
to pretty much

246
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
to pretty much
 

247
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,030
to pretty much
anything because they all pretty much

248
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
anything because they all pretty much
 

249
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,350
anything because they all pretty much
say

250
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
say
 

251
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,469
say
when you roll this um

252
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
when you roll this um
 

253
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,350
when you roll this um
so those are the two different opposing

254
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
so those are the two different opposing
 

255
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,629
so those are the two different opposing
schools of thought on this

256
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
schools of thought on this
 

257
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,670
schools of thought on this
issue uh i believe that the intent

258
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
issue uh i believe that the intent
 

259
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,950
issue uh i believe that the intent
is that yes assurance would apply

260
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
is that yes assurance would apply
 

261
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,230
is that yes assurance would apply
to using risky medicine or risky surgery

262
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
to using risky medicine or risky surgery
 

263
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,870
to using risky medicine or risky surgery
um you would not get the plus two bonus

264
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
um you would not get the plus two bonus
 

265
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,590
um you would not get the plus two bonus
to that

266
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
to that
 

267
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,070
to that
if you choose to use assurance with

268
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
if you choose to use assurance with
 

269
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,909
if you choose to use assurance with
risky surgery you would not get the plus

270
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
risky surgery you would not get the plus
 

271
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,510
risky surgery you would not get the plus
two circumstance bonus

272
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
two circumstance bonus
 

273
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,830
two circumstance bonus
uh because there are no bonuses or

274
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
uh because there are no bonuses or
 

275
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,430
uh because there are no bonuses or
penalties applied

276
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
penalties applied
 

277
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,909
penalties applied
to uh to the check result when you use

278
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
to uh to the check result when you use
 

279
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,270
to uh to the check result when you use
assurance

280
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
assurance
 

281
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,710
assurance
every gm can make their own

282
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
every gm can make their own
 

283
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,469
every gm can make their own
determinations those are the two

284
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
determinations those are the two
 

285
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,749
determinations those are the two
different schools of thought on that

286
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
different schools of thought on that
 

287
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,670
different schools of thought on that
issue but yes i believe

288

issue but yes i believe
 

289
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,469
issue but yes i believe
that uh the intent here is that

that uh the intent here is that
assurance could be used

292
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
assurance could be used
 

293
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,110
assurance could be used
with uh with risky surgery so
