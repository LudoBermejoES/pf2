review of the different states of
 

13
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,640
review of the different states of
detection there are four states of

detection
 

17
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,970

the first is unnoticed and it applies to

the first is unnoticed and it applies to
 

19
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,640
the first is unnoticed and it applies to
any creature you have absolutely no idea

the second is undetected a creature is
undetected when you do not know where it

undetected when you do not know where it
 

27
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,890
undetected when you do not know where it
is by definition all unnoticed creatures

third state of detection is called
 

39
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,390
third state of detection is called
hidden and it applies when you know a

00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,630
searching characters perception check is
challenged by your stealth DC and

90
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,640
challenged by your stealth DC and
 

91
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,890
challenged by your stealth DC and
stealth DC is calculated as 10 plus your

then they do not notice that you're

they roll a perception check against
 

163
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,960
they roll a perception check against
your stealth DC instead of relying on

164
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:37,970
your stealth DC instead of relying on
 

165
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,410
your stealth DC instead of relying on
their perception DC for example you walk

166
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,420
their perception DC for example you walk
 

167
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,689
their perception DC for example you walk

you are either concealed from them or

you are either concealed from them or

have a source of cover then you have

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,670
have a source of cover then you have
nowhere to hide and the attempt

nowhere to hide and the attempt
 

259
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,580

automatically fails if you do have cover
then you add the covers bonus to your

262
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,140
then you add the covers bonus to your
 

263
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,290
then you add the covers bonus to your
stealth check but only for those

264

stealth check but only for those

creatures who are observing you from the

creatures who are observing you from the
other side of that cover this is

268
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,470
other side of that cover this is
 

269
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,590
other side of that cover this is
basically common sense if the cover is

270
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
basically common sense if the cover is
 

271
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,720
basically common sense if the cover is
not between you and them then it doesn't

272
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:55,730
not between you and them then it doesn't
 

273
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,300
not between you and them then it doesn't
give you any benefit and likewise if you

00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,310
give you any benefit and likewise if you
 

275
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,490
give you any benefit and likewise if you
lose your cover or concealment you

276
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:00,500
lose your cover or concealment you
 

277
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,820
lose your cover or concealment you
instantly become observed again you also

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,400
instantly become observed again you also
immediately become observed if you use

immediately become observed if you use

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,460
immediately become observed if you use
any actions other than sneak step or

282
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,470
any actions other than sneak step or
 

283
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,700
any actions other than sneak step or
hide now there are two exceptions to

284
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:12,710
hide now there are two exceptions to
 

285
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,310
hide now there are two exceptions to
this and the first is the strike action

286
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,320
this and the first is the strike action
 

287
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,820
this and the first is the strike action
if you strike a target while hidden you

288
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:18,830
if you strike a target while hidden you
 

289
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,160
if you strike a target while hidden you
resolve the attack first and don't

290
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,170
resolve the attack first and don't
 

291
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,580
resolve the attack first and don't
become observed until after the attack

292
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:23,590
become observed until after the attack
 

293
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,860
become observed until after the attack
this means the target is flat-footed for

294
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:26,870
this means the target is flat-footed for
 

295
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,840
this means the target is flat-footed for
the attack and therefore the attacker

296
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:28,850
the attack and therefore the attacker
 

297

can use abilities like sneak attack with

can use abilities like sneak attack with

can use abilities like sneak attack with

their strike but once the attack is
 

301
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,610
their strike but once the attack is
resolved the hiding character instantly

302
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:36,620
resolved the hiding character instantly

is unobtrusive for example the seek

is unobtrusive for example the seek

is unobtrusive for example the seek
action if the hidden character wishes to
