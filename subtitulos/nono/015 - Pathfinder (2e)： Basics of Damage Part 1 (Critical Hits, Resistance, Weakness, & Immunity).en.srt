there will be times when you need to

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,400
there will be times when you need to
double the damage or cut it in half for

double the damage or cut it in half for
 

233
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,200
double the damage or cut it in half for
example when you roll a critical hit the

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,210
example when you roll a critical hit the
 

235
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,050
example when you roll a critical hit the
damage is doubled this is pretty simple

damage is doubled this is pretty simple
 

237
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,960
damage is doubled this is pretty simple
you just roll the damage as normal with

238
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:24,970
you just roll the damage as normal with
 

239
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,450
you just roll the damage as normal with
all the usual bonuses such as a strength

240
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,460
all the usual bonuses such as a strength
 

241
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,760
all the usual bonuses such as a strength
bonus for a melee attack and then you

242
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:29,770
bonus for a melee attack and then you
 

243
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,750
bonus for a melee attack and then you
multiply that total by 2 and then any

244
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:33,760
multiply that total by 2 and then any
 

245
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,300
multiply that total by 2 and then any
extra damage that only applies to

extra damage that only applies to
 

247
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,990
extra damage that only applies to
critical hits is added on top of that

248
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
critical hits is added on top of that
 

249
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,240
critical hits is added on top of that
for example weapons with the deadly

250
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,250
for example weapons with the deadly
 

251
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,910
for example weapons with the deadly
trait inflict additional bonus damage on

252
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:44,920
trait inflict additional bonus damage on
 

253
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,090
trait inflict additional bonus damage on
critical hits so say you have a strength

254
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,100
critical hits so say you have a strength
 

255
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,820
critical hits so say you have a strength
modifier of +2 and score a critical hit

256
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:50,830
modifier of +2 and score a critical hit
 

257
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,090
modifier of +2 and score a critical hit
with a rapier rapiers deal when d6

with a rapier rapiers deal when d6

with a rapier rapiers deal when d6
damage and have the deadly d8 trait on a

damage and have the deadly d8 trait on a
 

261
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,330
damage and have the deadly d8 trait on a
critical hit you would roll the normal

262
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:00,340
critical hit you would roll the normal
 

263
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,870
critical hit you would roll the normal
damage of one d6 + 2 and then double

264
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:03,880
damage of one d6 + 2 and then double
 

265
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,280
damage of one d6 + 2 and then double
that total and then add the extra 1 d8

266
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,290
that total and then add the extra 1 d8
 

267
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,130
that total and then add the extra 1 d8
for the deadly trait the key to remember

for the deadly trait the key to remember
 

269
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,280
for the deadly trait the key to remember
is you never double damage that only

270
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,290
is you never double damage that only
 

271
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,400
is you never double damage that only
occurs on critical hits so you wouldn't

272
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,410
occurs on critical hits so you wouldn't
 

273
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,800
occurs on critical hits so you wouldn't
double the one d8 from the deadly trait

274
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:19,810
double the one d8 from the deadly trait
 

275
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,620
double the one d8 from the deadly trait
because it only applies to critical hits

276
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:22,630
because it only applies to critical hits
 

277
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,800
because it only applies to critical hits

next let's consider a rogue using their

next let's consider a rogue using their
dagger to sneak attack someone again

dagger to sneak attack someone again
 

283
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,030
dagger to sneak attack someone again
will say they have a +2 strength

284
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,040
will say they have a +2 strength
 

285
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,940
will say they have a +2 strength
modifier and their sneak attack deals 1

modifier and their sneak attack deals 1
 

287
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,970
modifier and their sneak attack deals 1
d6 damage if this rogue score is a

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:37,980
d6 damage if this rogue score is a

that entire total is doubled because

discussed in part two first there are
 

335
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,700
discussed in part two first there are
three kinds of physical damage which are

336
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:43,710
three kinds of physical damage which are
 

337
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,430
three kinds of physical damage which are
bludgeoning like being hit with a club

338
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,440
bludgeoning like being hit with a club
 

339
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,400
bludgeoning like being hit with a club
or hammer piercing like being shot with

represent the damage type so when you

350
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:04,620
represent the damage type so when you
 

351
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,159
represent the damage type so when you
strike a skeleton with a war hammer you

352
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:07,169
strike a skeleton with a war hammer you
 

353
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,920
strike a skeleton with a war hammer you
don't deal six points of damage rather

354
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:09,930
don't deal six points of damage rather
 

355
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,620
don't deal six points of damage rather
you deal six points of bludgeoning

356
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:12,630
you deal six points of bludgeoning
 

357
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,400
you deal six points of bludgeoning
damage energy damage works much the same

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:24,870
Warhammer I was just mentioning was a
 

365
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,740
Warhammer I was just mentioning was a
flaming war hammer it might deal six

366
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:27,750
flaming war hammer it might deal six
 

367
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,260
flaming war hammer it might deal six
points of bludgeoning damage and four

368
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,270
points of bludgeoning damage and four
 

369
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,500
points of bludgeoning damage and four
points of fire damage it's important to

370
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,510
points of fire damage it's important to
 

371
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,050
points of fire damage it's important to
keep those separate rather than simply

372
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,060
keep those separate rather than simply
 

373
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,420
keep those separate rather than simply
saying you hit the skeleton for ten

374
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,430
saying you hit the skeleton for ten
 

375
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,579
saying you hit the skeleton for ten
points of damage and you'll see why it's

376
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:40,589
points of damage and you'll see why it's
 

377
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,339
points of damage and you'll see why it's
important to keep those two damage poles

378
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:43,349
important to keep those two damage poles
 

379
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,750
important to keep those two damage poles
separate when we get into step three

380
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:46,760
separate when we get into step three
 

381
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,150
separate when we get into step three
the material a weapon is made out of is

382
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,160
the material a weapon is made out of is
 

383
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,460
the material a weapon is made out of is
also important to note for example

384
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,470
also important to note for example
 

385
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,250
also important to note for example
weapons made from adamantine cold iron

386
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,260
weapons made from adamantine cold iron
 

387
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,670
weapons made from adamantine cold iron
or silver because of this some weapons

388
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
or silver because of this some weapons
 

389
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,560
or silver because of this some weapons
will have more than one trade assigned

390
00:08:59,560 --> 00:08:59,570
will have more than one trade assigned
 

391
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,590
will have more than one trade assigned
to a single damage effect so let's

392
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:02,600
to a single damage effect so let's
 

393
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,960
to a single damage effect so let's
consider that Warhammer and the skeleton

394
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:04,970
consider that Warhammer and the skeleton
 

395
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,780
consider that Warhammer and the skeleton
again if it was a flaming silver

396
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:07,790
again if it was a flaming silver
 

397
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,079
again if it was a flaming silver
Warhammer and it struck a skeleton we

398
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:11,089
Warhammer and it struck a skeleton we
 

399
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,329
Warhammer and it struck a skeleton we
would note that it did six points a

400
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:13,339
would note that it did six points a
 

401
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,420
would note that it did six points a
blitzing damage that also has the silver

402
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,430
blitzing damage that also has the silver
 

403
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,960
blitzing damage that also has the silver
trait and in addition to that also

404
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:19,970
trait and in addition to that also
 

405
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,730
trait and in addition to that also
inflicted four points of fire damage

406
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:21,740
inflicted four points of fire damage
 

407
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,920
inflicted four points of fire damage
when a weapon is made of a special

408
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:23,930
when a weapon is made of a special
 

409
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,400
when a weapon is made of a special
material like silver or cold iron that

410
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,410
material like silver or cold iron that
 

411
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,800
material like silver or cold iron that
trait is applied to the weapons based

412
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:29,810
trait is applied to the weapons based
 

413
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,220
trait is applied to the weapons based
damage type so it's silver and

414
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,230
damage type so it's silver and
 

415
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,040
damage type so it's silver and
bludgeoning for six points of damage but

416
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,050
bludgeoning for six points of damage but
 

417
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,860
bludgeoning for six points of damage but
the fire damage is merely fire damage

418
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:38,870
the fire damage is merely fire damage
 

419
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,120
the fire damage is merely fire damage
and not silver fire damage those are the

420
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,130
and not silver fire damage those are the
 

421
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,400
and not silver fire damage those are the
most common damage types that we will be

422
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,410
most common damage types that we will be
 

423
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,319
most common damage types that we will be
using in this discussion about the

424
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:47,329
using in this discussion about the
 

425
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,840
using in this discussion about the
four-step process for managing damage

426
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:49,850
four-step process for managing damage
 

427
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,720
four-step process for managing damage
but there are a few more including

428
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:52,730
but there are a few more including
 

429
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,509
but there are a few more including
alignment damage positive damage

430
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
alignment damage positive damage
 

431
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,939
alignment damage positive damage
negative damage and precision damage

432
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:57,949
negative damage and precision damage
 

433
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:02,590
negative damage and precision damage
that all will be covered in part two

434
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:02,600

 

435
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,900

once you determine the type of damage

436
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:04,910
once you determine the type of damage
 

437
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,300
once you determine the type of damage
being inflicted you can then check for

438
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,310
being inflicted you can then check for
 

439
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,640
being inflicted you can then check for
any special resistances or weaknesses

440
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:09,650
any special resistances or weaknesses
 

441
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,610
any special resistances or weaknesses
the target might have and it's important

442
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:12,620
the target might have and it's important
 

443
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,140
the target might have and it's important
to note that these conditions are

444
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,150
to note that these conditions are
 

445
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,100
to note that these conditions are
applied in a very specific order first

446
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,110
applied in a very specific order first
 

447
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,940
applied in a very specific order first
you apply any immunities then you apply

448
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:21,950
you apply any immunities then you apply
 

449
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,850
you apply any immunities then you apply
any weaknesses unless you apply

450
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:24,860
any weaknesses unless you apply
 

451
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,260
any weaknesses unless you apply
resistances so first immunities when a

452
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,270
resistances so first immunities when a
 

453
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,290
resistances so first immunities when a
creature is immune to a damage type

454
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,300
creature is immune to a damage type
 

455
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,270
creature is immune to a damage type
damage of that type is completely

456
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,280
damage of that type is completely
 

457
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,920
damage of that type is completely
ignored but only that specific type so

458
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:38,930
ignored but only that specific type so
 

459
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,980
ignored but only that specific type so
if a creature that is immune to fire is

460
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:41,990
if a creature that is immune to fire is
 

461
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,190
if a creature that is immune to fire is
hit by a flaming silver warhammer that

462
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
hit by a flaming silver warhammer that
 

463
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,170
hit by a flaming silver warhammer that
deals six points of silver bleaching

464
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,180
deals six points of silver bleaching
 

465
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,210
deals six points of silver bleaching
damage and four points of fire damage

466
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,220
damage and four points of fire damage
 

467
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,030
damage and four points of fire damage
they'll ignore all of the fire damage

468
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,040
they'll ignore all of the fire damage
 

469
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,790
they'll ignore all of the fire damage
but still suffer the six points of

470
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
but still suffer the six points of
 

471
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,120
but still suffer the six points of
silver bludgeoning some creatures like

472
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,130
silver bludgeoning some creatures like
 

473
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,700
silver bludgeoning some creatures like
uses might be immune to critical hits

474
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:00,710
uses might be immune to critical hits
 

475
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,210
uses might be immune to critical hits
and I think that that is poorly named it

476
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,220
and I think that that is poorly named it
 

477
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,070
and I think that that is poorly named it
might be better to think of it as

478
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,080
might be better to think of it as
 

479
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,310
might be better to think of it as
immunity to critical damage because when

480
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,320
immunity to critical damage because when
 

481
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,920
immunity to critical damage because when
a creature that is listed as being

482
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:11,930
a creature that is listed as being
 

483
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,260
a creature that is listed as being
immune to critical hits is tricked by a

484
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,270
immune to critical hits is tricked by a
 

485
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,690
immune to critical hits is tricked by a
critical hit it does normal damage

486
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:16,700
critical hit it does normal damage
 

487
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,660
critical hit it does normal damage
instead of double damage and that's the

488
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:19,670
instead of double damage and that's the
 

489
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,020
instead of double damage and that's the
only change if the critical hit includes

490
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,030
only change if the critical hit includes
 

491
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,320
only change if the critical hit includes
other effects like a grapple then that

492
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,330
other effects like a grapple then that
 

493
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,040
other effects like a grapple then that

the deadly trait after all if the use is

the deadly trait after all if the use is
immune to critical hits because it

immune to critical hits because it
 

513
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,660
immune to critical hits because it
doesn't have any vital organs then is

the single highest weakness value and

the single highest weakness value and
this can be a little tricky so if a

this can be a little tricky so if a

this can be a little tricky so if a
creature has two weaknesses say they

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,620
have the witness silver ten and the
weakness pledging five and you hit it

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:14,630
weakness pledging five and you hit it
 

573
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,499
weakness pledging five and you hit it
with a flaming silver war hammer that

damage and four points of fire damage
 

579
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,530
damage and four points of fire damage
then that creature will suffer sixteen

580
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:23,540
then that creature will suffer sixteen
 

581
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,660
then that creature will suffer sixteen
points of silver bludgeoning damage not

21 and four points of fire damage for a
total of twenty because when more than

00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,629
total of twenty because when more than
one trait applies to the same damage

one trait applies to the same damage
 

589
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,870
one trait applies to the same damage
effect in this case both silver and

590
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:37,880
effect in this case both silver and
 

591
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,509
effect in this case both silver and
bludgeoning apply to these six points of

592
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:40,519
bludgeoning apply to these six points of
 

593
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,120
bludgeoning apply to these six points of
weapon damage then you only apply the

594
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,130
weapon damage then you only apply the
 

595
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,269
weapon damage then you only apply the
highest weakness and neither of those

596
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:46,279
highest weakness and neither of those
 

597
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,670
highest weakness and neither of those
traits apply to the fire damage effect

598
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:48,680
traits apply to the fire damage effect
 

599
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,579
traits apply to the fire damage effect
so it is not changed by the weaknesses

600
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:51,589
so it is not changed by the weaknesses
 

601
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,280
so it is not changed by the weaknesses
even though fire was caused by a weapon

602
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,290
even though fire was caused by a weapon
 

603
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,220
even though fire was caused by a weapon
that has those traits for its physical

604
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,230
that has those traits for its physical
 

605
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,129
that has those traits for its physical
damage type but if a creature has the

606
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:00,139
damage type but if a creature has the
 

607
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,100
damage type but if a creature has the
witness's fire fawn life and silver ten

608
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,110
witness's fire fawn life and silver ten
 

609
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,860
witness's fire fawn life and silver ten
and is struck by our hammer it will

610
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:05,870
and is struck by our hammer it will
 

611
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,530
and is struck by our hammer it will
suffer both of those weaknesses because

612
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,540
suffer both of those weaknesses because
 

613
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,480
suffer both of those weaknesses because
they are separate damage roles in

614
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,490
they are separate damage roles in
 

615
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,090
they are separate damage roles in
separate damage effects even though

616
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,100
separate damage effects even though
 

617
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,090
separate damage effects even though
they're from the same attack the key to

618
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,100
they're from the same attack the key to
 

619
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,329
they're from the same attack the key to
remember here is that this almost never

620
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:19,339
remember here is that this almost never
 

621
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,730
remember here is that this almost never
occurs except when a creature is

622
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:21,740
occurs except when a creature is
 

623
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,460
occurs except when a creature is
vulnerable to both a type of physical

624
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,470
vulnerable to both a type of physical
 

625
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,530
vulnerable to both a type of physical
damage like bludgeoning piercing or

626
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:26,540
damage like bludgeoning piercing or
 

627
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,860
damage like bludgeoning piercing or
slashing and also weak to the material

628
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:29,870
slashing and also weak to the material
 

629
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,110
slashing and also weak to the material
the weapon is made of like adamantine

630
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,120
the weapon is made of like adamantine
 

631
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,679
the weapon is made of like adamantine
cold iron or silver because then is one

632
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:35,689
cold iron or silver because then is one
 

633
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:38,559
cold iron or silver because then is one
damage role but two traits that trigger

634
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:38,569
damage role but two traits that trigger
 

635
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:42,549
damage role but two traits that trigger
two weaknesses and last after applying

636
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:42,559
two weaknesses and last after applying
 

637
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,069
two weaknesses and last after applying
immunities in weaknesses you then apply

638
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:45,079
immunities in weaknesses you then apply
 

639
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,460
immunities in weaknesses you then apply
resistances this works much the same way

640
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:48,470
resistances this works much the same way
 

641
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,189
resistances this works much the same way
as weaknesses except you subtract the

642
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
as weaknesses except you subtract the
 

643
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,019
as weaknesses except you subtract the
value listed from the damage instead of

644
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:53,029
value listed from the damage instead of
 

645
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,360
value listed from the damage instead of
adding it so if you attack a creature

646
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,370
adding it so if you attack a creature
 

647
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,790
adding it so if you attack a creature
that has resistance to bludgeoning ten

648
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:57,800
that has resistance to bludgeoning ten
 

649
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,429
that has resistance to bludgeoning ten
and deals six points of bludgeoning and

650
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:00,439
and deals six points of bludgeoning and
 

651
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,410
and deals six points of bludgeoning and
four points of fire damage with your

652
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:02,420
four points of fire damage with your
 

653
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,960
four points of fire damage with your
trusty flaming Warhammer they will

654
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:04,970
trusty flaming Warhammer they will
 

655
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,019
trusty flaming Warhammer they will
suffer 0 bludgeoning damage but would

656
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:08,029
suffer 0 bludgeoning damage but would
 

657
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:10,179
suffer 0 bludgeoning damage but would

until step four and one more type of

664
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,410
until step four and one more type of
 

665
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,670
until step four and one more type of
resistance that's worth mentioning is

666
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:20,680
resistance that's worth mentioning is
 

667
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,610
resistance that's worth mentioning is
resistance to non magical attacks and a

668
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:24,620
resistance to non magical attacks and a
 

669
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,249
resistance to non magical attacks and a
case like that you apply the resistance

670
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:27,259
case like that you apply the resistance
 

671
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,949
case like that you apply the resistance
to normal weapon attacks but not to

672
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:29,959
to normal weapon attacks but not to
 

673
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,319
to normal weapon attacks but not to
magical weapon attacks so say you're

674
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:32,329
magical weapon attacks so say you're
 

675
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,999
magical weapon attacks so say you're
fighting a creature that has resistance

676
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:34,009
fighting a creature that has resistance
 

677
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,759
fighting a creature that has resistance
five to non-magical weapons if you hit

678
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:36,769
five to non-magical weapons if you hit
 

679
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,429
five to non-magical weapons if you hit
it with a normal hammer and roll six

680
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:39,439
it with a normal hammer and roll six
 

681
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,189
it with a normal hammer and roll six
points of damage that will be reduced to

682
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:42,199
points of damage that will be reduced to
 

683
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:45,069
points of damage that will be reduced to
only one but if you hit it with a plus

684
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,079
only one but if you hit it with a plus
 

685
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,920
only one but if you hit it with a plus
one war hammer it has the magical trait

686
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:47,930
one war hammer it has the magical trait
 

687
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,379
one war hammer it has the magical trait
and therefore none of his damage is

688
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:50,389
and therefore none of his damage is
 

689
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,079
and therefore none of his damage is
reduced by resistance to non magical

690
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:53,089
reduced by resistance to non magical
 

691
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:55,430
reduced by resistance to non magical
attacks

692
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440

 

693
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,330

so just to bring this all together

694
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,340
so just to bring this all together
 

695
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,910
so just to bring this all together
remember that damage is applied in four

696
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
remember that damage is applied in four
 

697
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,720
remember that damage is applied in four
steps step one is calculate the damage

698
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:05,730
steps step one is calculate the damage
 

699
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,690
steps step one is calculate the damage
you roll the damage dice and add all the

700
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:08,700
you roll the damage dice and add all the
 

701
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,470
you roll the damage dice and add all the
usual modifiers to it step two determine

702
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
usual modifiers to it step two determine
 

703
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,950
usual modifiers to it step two determine
the type of damage at this step you're

704
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:15,960
the type of damage at this step you're
 

705
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,260
the type of damage at this step you're
mostly just making note of the different

706
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,270
mostly just making note of the different
 

707
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,330
mostly just making note of the different
traits of the attack for use in the next

708
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,340
traits of the attack for use in the next
 

709
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,600
traits of the attack for use in the next
step which is step three where you apply

710
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:23,610
step which is step three where you apply
 

711
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,080
step which is step three where you apply
immunities and then you apply witnesses

712
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,090
immunities and then you apply witnesses
 

713
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,610
immunities and then you apply witnesses
and last you apply resistances and last

714
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:31,620
and last you apply resistances and last
 

715
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,160
and last you apply resistances and last
in step four you reduce the targets hit

716
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,170
in step four you reduce the targets hit
 

717
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,930
in step four you reduce the targets hit
points by whatever amount of damage

718
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:35,940
points by whatever amount of damage
 

719
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,870
points by whatever amount of damage
remains after step three this would also

720
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
remains after step three this would also
 

721
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,970
remains after step three this would also
be when you would apply the hardness of

722
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:40,980
be when you would apply the hardness of
 

723
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,760
be when you would apply the hardness of
an object or shield the value of the

724
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,770
an object or shield the value of the
 

725
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,920
an object or shield the value of the
hardness is deducted from the final

726
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:45,930
hardness is deducted from the final
 

727
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,560
hardness is deducted from the final
total of damage and not individually for

728
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:48,570
total of damage and not individually for
 

729
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,200
total of damage and not individually for
each different type is important to

730
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,210
each different type is important to
 

731
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,450
each different type is important to
understand these steps so that you can

732
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:53,460
understand these steps so that you can
 

733
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,030
understand these steps so that you can
answer questions like if I critically

734
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,040
answer questions like if I critically
 

735
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,220
answer questions like if I critically
hit a monster that has a weakness to

736
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,230
hit a monster that has a weakness to
 

737
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,620
hit a monster that has a weakness to
fire with my flaming war hammer do i

738
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:00,630
fire with my flaming war hammer do i
 

739
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,660
fire with my flaming war hammer do i
double the extra damage from that

740
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,670
double the extra damage from that
 

741
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,309
double the extra damage from that
weakness and the answer is no you don't

742
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
weakness and the answer is no you don't
 

743
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,110
weakness and the answer is no you don't
even though a critical hit doubles all

744
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
even though a critical hit doubles all
 

745
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,329
even though a critical hit doubles all
the damage that is not dependent on

746
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339
the damage that is not dependent on
 

747
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,569
the damage that is not dependent on
there being a critical hit that doubling

748
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:14,579
there being a critical hit that doubling
 

749
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,350
there being a critical hit that doubling
occurs in step one and you don't adjust

750
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,360
occurs in step one and you don't adjust
 

751
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,260
occurs in step one and you don't adjust
for a weakness or a resistance until

752
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,270
for a weakness or a resistance until
 

753
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,400
for a weakness or a resistance until
step three

754
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,410
step three
 

755
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,579
step three
so know that extra damage from the

756
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:25,589
so know that extra damage from the
 

757
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,550
so know that extra damage from the
weakness is not doubled because that

758
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:28,560
weakness is not doubled because that
 

759
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,070
weakness is not doubled because that
doubling happens in step one which is

760
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,080
doubling happens in step one which is
 

761
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,260
doubling happens in step one which is
before the weakness being applied in

762
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,270
before the weakness being applied in
 

763
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,440
before the weakness being applied in
step three and that's the basic

764
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,450
step three and that's the basic
 

765
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,050
step three and that's the basic
foundation for how damage works in path

766
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,060
foundation for how damage works in path
