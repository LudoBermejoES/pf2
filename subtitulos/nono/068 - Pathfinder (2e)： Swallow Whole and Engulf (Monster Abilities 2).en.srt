423
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,189

those are the general rules for swallow

those are the general rules for swallow
 

425
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,029
those are the general rules for swallow
hull but there is another related

hull but there is another related

monster ability that we need to discuss
 

429
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,070
monster ability that we need to discuss
and that is engulf engulf works much the

430
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
and that is engulf engulf works much the
 

431
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,589
and that is engulf engulf works much the
same way as swallow hull

432
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
same way as swallow hull
 

433
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,350
same way as swallow hull
