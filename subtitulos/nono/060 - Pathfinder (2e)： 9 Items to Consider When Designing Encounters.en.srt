these are not items that must be

these are not items that must be
 

89
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,990
these are not items that must be
included in each encounter but again are

included in each encounter but again are
 

91

99
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,390

the first item on the list is the rule

100
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
the first item on the list is the rule
 

101
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,429
the first item on the list is the rule
of six

102
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
of six
 

103
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,749

the rule of six basically means spread
