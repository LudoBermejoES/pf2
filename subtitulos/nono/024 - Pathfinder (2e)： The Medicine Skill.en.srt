to wear up to two bulk worth of tools
 

209
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,589
to wear up to two bulk worth of tools
when doing so they can retrieve and stow

210
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
when doing so they can retrieve and stow
 

211
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,589
when doing so they can retrieve and stow
the tools with the same actions they

the tools with the same actions they
 

213
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,670
the tools with the same actions they
spend in order to use them

spend in order to use them
 

215
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,830
spend in order to use them
so for example it would only take two

216
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
so for example it would only take two
 

217
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,110
so for example it would only take two
actions for a person

218
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
actions for a person
 

219
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,710

were instead
 

227
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,149
were instead
stored then that person would need to

00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
stored then that person would need to
 

229
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,229
stored then that person would need to
spend one interact action to get their

fourth action to put the tools away

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
fourth action to put the tools away
 

239
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,949
fourth action to put the tools away
meaning they couldn't do all of this

240
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
meaning they couldn't do all of this
 

241
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,750
meaning they couldn't do all of this
in one turn so remember you are allowed

242
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
in one turn so remember you are allowed
 

243
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,670

when you use administer first aid you
 

251
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,469
when you use administer first aid you
choose to either stabilize the target or

00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
choose to either stabilize the target or
 

253
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,030
choose to either stabilize the target or
stop their bleeding when stabilizing you

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
you need to roll a missing check that is
 

273
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,390
you need to roll a missing check that is
5 higher than this

5 higher than this
 

275
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,310
5 higher than this
or usually 15 plus that person's dying

11 recovery check on their turn and you
 

285
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,150
11 recovery check on their turn and you
would need to roll

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
would need to roll
 

287
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,430
would need to roll

their recovery check would be dc13 and
 

297
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,310

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,629
critically fail this check then you do
more harm than good

more harm than good
 

323
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,469

of each of their turns and then get to
 

335
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,430
of each of their turns and then get to
roll a dc-15 flat shake to see if the

bleed effect wears off
 

339
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,350
