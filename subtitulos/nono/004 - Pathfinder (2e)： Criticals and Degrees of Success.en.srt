00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,089
Pathfinder second edition by how it's
played in Pathfinder most actions result

6
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:11,099
played in Pathfinder most actions result

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,450
played in Pathfinder most actions result
in one of four degrees of success

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,460
in one of four degrees of success
 

9
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,250
in one of four degrees of success
success failure critical success and

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,260
success failure critical success and
 

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,890
success failure critical success and
critical failure success and failure are

12
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:18,900
critical failure success and failure are
 

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,290
critical failure success and failure are
often understood but the two critical

14
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,300
often understood but the two critical
 

15
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,290
often understood but the two critical
results can sometimes cause confusion so

16
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,300
results can sometimes cause confusion so
 

17
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,090
results can sometimes cause confusion so
in this video I'm going to cover how to

18
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,100
in this video I'm going to cover how to
 

19
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,830
in this video I'm going to cover how to
determine the degree of success for a

20
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
determine the degree of success for a
 

21
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,290
determine the degree of success for a
chick and specifically how critical

22
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:30,300
chick and specifically how critical
 

23
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,130
chick and specifically how critical
successes work with damage

24
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,140
successes work with damage
 

25
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,930
successes work with damage
determining success or failure is fairly

26
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,940
determining success or failure is fairly
 

27
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,510
determining success or failure is fairly
easy each check involves rolling a D20

28
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,520
easy each check involves rolling a D20
 

29
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,150
easy each check involves rolling a D20
adding or subtracting modifiers to it

30
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,160
adding or subtracting modifiers to it
 

31
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,610
adding or subtracting modifiers to it
and then comparing that total to a

32
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:43,620
and then comparing that total to a
 

33
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,790
and then comparing that total to a
difficulty class or DC in the case of

34
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
difficulty class or DC in the case of
 

35
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,549
difficulty class or DC in the case of
most attacks the target's Armor class is

36
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:49,559
most attacks the target's Armor class is
 

37
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,150
most attacks the target's Armor class is
the DC for that check so for example if

38
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
the DC for that check so for example if
 

39
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,150
the DC for that check so for example if
an enemy had an armor class of 24 you

40
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
an enemy had an armor class of 24 you
 

41
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,729
an enemy had an armor class of 24 you
would need to roll a 24 or higher for

42
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:58,739
would need to roll a 24 or higher for
 

43
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,709
would need to roll a 24 or higher for
that check to be a success and hit them

44
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
that check to be a success and hit them
 

45
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,850
that check to be a success and hit them
if you roll a 23 or lower you fail and

46
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:04,860
if you roll a 23 or lower you fail and
 

47
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,530
if you roll a 23 or lower you fail and
it's important to note that the person

48
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:06,540
it's important to note that the person
 

49
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,950
it's important to note that the person
rolling the die wins the ties that's

50
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:09,960
rolling the die wins the ties that's
 

51
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,109
rolling the die wins the ties that's
pretty straightforward and probably what

52
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:12,119
pretty straightforward and probably what
 

53
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,429
pretty straightforward and probably what
you're used to if you've played other

54
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
you're used to if you've played other
 

55
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,010
you're used to if you've played other
D20 role-playing games but critical

56
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,020
D20 role-playing games but critical
 

57
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,289
D20 role-playing games but critical
results is where things differ with

58
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:18,299
results is where things differ with
 

59
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,170
results is where things differ with
Pathfinder second edition here a check

60
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,180
Pathfinder second edition here a check
 

61
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,450
Pathfinder second edition here a check
results in a critical when the modified

62
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:23,460
results in a critical when the modified
 

63
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,749
results in a critical when the modified
total is at least 10 more or 10 less

64
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
total is at least 10 more or 10 less
 

65
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,310
total is at least 10 more or 10 less
than the DC

66
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
than the DC
 

67
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,649
than the DC
so going back to our example if you're

68
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:30,659
so going back to our example if you're
 

69
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,330
so going back to our example if you're
attacking an enemy that has an armor

70
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:32,340
attacking an enemy that has an armor
 

71
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,050
attacking an enemy that has an armor
class of 24 roll a 19 on the die and

72
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,060
class of 24 roll a 19 on the die and
 

73
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,870
class of 24 roll a 19 on the die and
have an attack bonus of plus 15 the

74
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
have an attack bonus of plus 15 the
 

75
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,170
have an attack bonus of plus 15 the
total for that check is 34 which is 10

76
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,180
total for that check is 34 which is 10
 

77
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,050
total for that check is 34 which is 10
higher than the target DC and therefore

78
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,060
higher than the target DC and therefore
 

79
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,289
higher than the target DC and therefore
the result is a critical success as

80
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:48,299
the result is a critical success as
 

81
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,149
the result is a critical success as
another example let's say the party

82
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
another example let's say the party
 

83
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,310
another example let's say the party
wizard is making an untrained Athletics

84
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
wizard is making an untrained Athletics
 

85
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,609
wizard is making an untrained Athletics
check they have a modifier of plus 0 and

86
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:55,619
check they have a modifier of plus 0 and
 

87
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,730
check they have a modifier of plus 0 and
the DC for the check is 16. they roll a

88
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:58,740
the DC for the check is 16. they roll a
 

89
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,310
the DC for the check is 16. they roll a
4 and the nine plus zero so it's also a

90
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,320
4 and the nine plus zero so it's also a
 

91
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,310
4 and the nine plus zero so it's also a
total of four which is more than 10

92
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
total of four which is more than 10
 

93
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,310
total of four which is more than 10
lower than the DC so they critically

94
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,320
lower than the DC so they critically
 

95
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,949
lower than the DC so they critically
failed this check as you can see in

96
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:09,959
failed this check as you can see in
 

97
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,050
failed this check as you can see in
Pathfinder second edition there are more

98
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,060
Pathfinder second edition there are more
 

99
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,270
Pathfinder second edition there are more
ways to score a critical success or a

100
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,280
ways to score a critical success or a
 

101
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,490
ways to score a critical success or a
critical failure than rolling a natural

20 or a natural one
as mentioned before there are four

106
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,260
as mentioned before there are four
 

107
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,890
as mentioned before there are four
degrees of success from best result to

108
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:24,900
degrees of success from best result to
 

109
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,030
degrees of success from best result to
worst they are critical success success

110
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,040
worst they are critical success success
 

111
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,890
worst they are critical success success
failure and critical failure it's

112
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:30,900
failure and critical failure it's
 

113
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,690
failure and critical failure it's
important to remember that in Pathfinder

114
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:32,700
important to remember that in Pathfinder
 

115
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,990
important to remember that in Pathfinder
a natural 20 is not an automatic success

116
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
a natural 20 is not an automatic success
 

117
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,410
a natural 20 is not an automatic success
or a critical success likewise a natural

118
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:39,420
or a critical success likewise a natural
 

119
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,350
or a critical success likewise a natural
one is not always automatically a

120
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,360
one is not always automatically a
 

121
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,890
one is not always automatically a
critical failure instead a natural 20

122
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:45,900
critical failure instead a natural 20
 

123
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,470
critical failure instead a natural 20
means you calculate success as normal

124
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
means you calculate success as normal
 

125
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,470
means you calculate success as normal
and then increase the degree of success

126
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,480
and then increase the degree of success
 

127
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,410
and then increase the degree of success
by one step in a natural one means you

128
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:54,420
by one step in a natural one means you
 

129
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,690
by one step in a natural one means you
calculate success as normal and then

130
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:56,700
calculate success as normal and then
 

131
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,270
calculate success as normal and then
decrease its degree of success by one

132
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
decrease its degree of success by one
 

133
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,050
decrease its degree of success by one

00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:02,099
for example let's say a player is
 

137
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,130
for example let's say a player is
attacking an enemy of a significantly

145
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,930
class of 30. they're rolling natural 20
but that does not mean they scored a

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:14,940
but that does not mean they scored a
 

147
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,449
but that does not mean they scored a
critical hit instead you need to

148
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459
critical hit instead you need to
 

149
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,910
critical hit instead you need to
determine the degree of success as usual

150
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
determine the degree of success as usual
 

151
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,570
determine the degree of success as usual
20 plus 8 is 28 compared to an armor

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,990
on a normal success this doesn't mean
that it is impossible to fail or

when an attack scores a critical hit it
 

321
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,110
when an attack scores a critical hit it
deals double the normal damage what this

deals double the normal damage what this
 

323
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,170
deals double the normal damage what this
means is all damage that would occur for

means is all damage that would occur for
 

325
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,930
means is all damage that would occur for

a critical hit is not doubled let's take

330
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
a critical hit is not doubled let's take
 

331
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,610
a critical hit is not doubled let's take
a look at a few examples to help

332
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,620
a look at a few examples to help
 

333
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,930
a look at a few examples to help
illustrate this

334
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:11,940
illustrate this
 

335
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,689
illustrate this
in our first example a fighter scores a

in our first example a fighter scores a
critical hit with their long sword this

338
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,100
critical hit with their long sword this
 

339
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,610
critical hit with their long sword this
attack normally deals 1d8 damage for the

attack normally deals 1d8 damage for the
 

341
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,710
attack normally deals 1d8 damage for the
sword plus three for their strength

modifier

344
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:22,740
modifier
 

345
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,670
modifier
since all of this damage normally occurs

346
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
since all of this damage normally occurs
 

347
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,189
since all of this damage normally occurs
on a regular hit you roll it as normal

348
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:28,199
on a regular hit you roll it as normal
 

349
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,309
on a regular hit you roll it as normal
and then double it so if this finder

350
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:31,319
and then double it so if this finder
 

351
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,129
and then double it so if this finder
rolled A3 on the d8 you would add the

352
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:34,139
rolled A3 on the d8 you would add the
 

353
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,290
rolled A3 on the d8 you would add the
strength modifier a plus three for a

354
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,300
strength modifier a plus three for a
 

355
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,749
strength modifier a plus three for a
total of six and then double that to

356
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:38,759
total of six and then double that to
 

357
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,409
total of six and then double that to
find the total of 12 damage and yes this

358
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:42,419
find the total of 12 damage and yes this
 

359
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,930
find the total of 12 damage and yes this
does mean that static bonuses like the

360
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
does mean that static bonuses like the
 

361
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,510
does mean that static bonuses like the
strength modifier do get doubled in

362
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
strength modifier do get doubled in
 

363
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,309
strength modifier do get doubled in

about the sneak attack damage does that
 

397
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,629
about the sneak attack damage does that
get doubled well ask yourself would this

determine the amount that is doubled you

434
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
determine the amount that is doubled you
 

435
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,370
determine the amount that is doubled you
just ask yourself how much of this

436
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,380
just ask yourself how much of this
 

437
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,430
just ask yourself how much of this
damage would be applied on a regular hit

438
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
damage would be applied on a regular hit
 

439
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,650
damage would be applied on a regular hit
well all of this except for the d8 from

440
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:24,660
well all of this except for the d8 from
 

441
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,230
well all of this except for the d8 from
the weapons deadly trait would occur on

442
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,240
the weapons deadly trait would occur on
 

443
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,470
the weapons deadly trait would occur on
a regular success a normal hit so all of

444
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
a regular success a normal hit so all of
 

445
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,750
a regular success a normal hit so all of
that damage is going to be doubled and

446
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,760
that damage is going to be doubled and
 

447
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,670
that damage is going to be doubled and
the d8 from the deadly trait would only

448
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680
the d8 from the deadly trait would only
 

449
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,790
the d8 from the deadly trait would only
apply once therefore you calculate this

450
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:37,800
apply once therefore you calculate this
 

451
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,810
apply once therefore you calculate this
as 12 plus 8 plus 4 and then add the

452
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:41,820
as 12 plus 8 plus 4 and then add the
 

453
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,970
as 12 plus 8 plus 4 and then add the
four from the deadly trait for a total

454
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:43,980
four from the deadly trait for a total
 

455
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,210
four from the deadly trait for a total
of 28. again you would not double the

456
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,220
of 28. again you would not double the
 

457
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,910
of 28. again you would not double the
four from deadly because deadly does not

458
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
four from deadly because deadly does not
 

459
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,550
four from deadly because deadly does not
occur on regular hits since it is

460
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
occur on regular hits since it is
 

461
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,190
occur on regular hits since it is
triggered by critical hits it is not

462
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
triggered by critical hits it is not
 

463
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,829
triggered by critical hits it is not
doubled and yes this doubling also

464
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
doubled and yes this doubling also
 

465
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,530
doubled and yes this doubling also
