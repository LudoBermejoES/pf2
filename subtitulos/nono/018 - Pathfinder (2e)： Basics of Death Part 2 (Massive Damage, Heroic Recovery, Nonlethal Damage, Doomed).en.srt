and Pathfinder is what happens to all of
my conditions in other effects when I

22
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,210
my conditions in other effects when I
 

23
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,509
my conditions in other effects when I
get knocked unconscious for example if

24
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
get knocked unconscious for example if
 

25
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,090
get knocked unconscious for example if
I'm a wizard and have spills active do

26
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:34,100
I'm a wizard and have spills active do
 

27
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,830
I'm a wizard and have spills active do
they remain active while I'm knocked out

28
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
they remain active while I'm knocked out

duration ends let's look at wall afire

34
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:44,780
duration ends let's look at wall afire
 

35
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,500
duration ends let's look at wall afire
we see here it has a duration of one

36
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:47,510
we see here it has a duration of one
 

37
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,170
we see here it has a duration of one
minute so if you cast wall of fire and

38
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,180
minute so if you cast wall of fire and
 

39
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,479
minute so if you cast wall of fire and
then get reduced to zero hit points or

40
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:52,489
then get reduced to zero hit points or
 

41
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,539
then get reduced to zero hit points or
even if you die then that death will

42
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:55,549
even if you die then that death will
 

43
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,179
even if you die then that death will
have no effect on the wall it will

44
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:58,189
have no effect on the wall it will
 

45
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:00,759
have no effect on the wall it will
persist until one minute has passed from

46
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:00,769
persist until one minute has passed from
 

47
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,340
persist until one minute has passed from
the moment that you cast it but on the

48
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,350
the moment that you cast it but on the
 

49
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,100
the moment that you cast it but on the
other hand let's say you cast protectors

50
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,110
other hand let's say you cast protectors
 

51
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,399
other hand let's say you cast protectors
sphere and then get knocked unconscious

52
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:08,409
sphere and then get knocked unconscious
 

53
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,469
sphere and then get knocked unconscious
does that mean the sphere goes away and

54
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:11,479
does that mean the sphere goes away and
 

55
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,469
does that mean the sphere goes away and
your allies lose their damage resistance

56
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:13,479
your allies lose their damage resistance
 

57
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,149
your allies lose their damage resistance
well if we look at its duration we see

58
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
well if we look at its duration we see
 

59
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,899
well if we look at its duration we see
it says sustained up to one minute

60
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:18,909
it says sustained up to one minute
 

61
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,390
it says sustained up to one minute
sustain means the spell ends at the end

62
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
sustain means the spell ends at the end
 

63
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,480
sustain means the spell ends at the end
of your next turn unless you use an

64
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,490
of your next turn unless you use an
 

65
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,429
of your next turn unless you use an
action to sustain it for another round

66
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
action to sustain it for another round
 

67
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,059
action to sustain it for another round
in the case of protector sphere it can

68
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:31,069
in the case of protector sphere it can
 

69
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,919
in the case of protector sphere it can
be sustained up to one minute

70
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:32,929
be sustained up to one minute
 

71
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,559
be sustained up to one minute
so we'll say you cast the sphere and

72
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:35,569
so we'll say you cast the sphere and
 

73
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,959
so we'll say you cast the sphere and
then get reduced to zero hit points in

74
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:37,969
then get reduced to zero hit points in
 

75
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:40,870
then get reduced to zero hit points in
knocked unconscious the sphere does not

76
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
knocked unconscious the sphere does not
 

77
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,899
knocked unconscious the sphere does not
go away immediately and instead it

78
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:43,909
go away immediately and instead it
 

79
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,989
go away immediately and instead it
continues to operate until the end of

80
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:46,999
continues to operate until the end of
 

81
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,389
continues to operate until the end of
your next turn which should be a full

82
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:49,399
your next turn which should be a full
 

83
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,830
your next turn which should be a full
round because when you're not

84
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:50,840
round because when you're not
 

85
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,050
round because when you're not
unconscious your place and initiative is

86
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,060
unconscious your place and initiative is
 

87
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,569
unconscious your place and initiative is
moved to immediately before the turn in

88
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:55,579
moved to immediately before the turn in
 

89
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,639
moved to immediately before the turn in
which you are reduced to zero hit points

90
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:57,649
which you are reduced to zero hit points
 

91
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,879
which you are reduced to zero hit points
if someone heals you before then so you

92
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:00,889
if someone heals you before then so you
 

93
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,309
if someone heals you before then so you
have hit points in our conscious you

94
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:03,319
have hit points in our conscious you
 

95
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,440
have hit points in our conscious you
can't sustain the spell on your next

96
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,450
can't sustain the spell on your next
 

97
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,620
can't sustain the spell on your next
turn just like normal but if your next

98
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:08,630
turn just like normal but if your next
 

99
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,210
turn just like normal but if your next
turn comes around and you're still

100
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,220
turn comes around and you're still
 

101
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,790
turn comes around and you're still
unconscious then the sphere will go away

102
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
unconscious then the sphere will go away
 

103
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,640
unconscious then the sphere will go away
and everyone will lose their dr at the

104
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:15,650
and everyone will lose their dr at the
 

105
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,699
and everyone will lose their dr at the
end of that turn that's what happens to

106
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:18,709
end of that turn that's what happens to
 

107
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:19,990
end of that turn that's what happens to
use spell effects when you're knocked

108
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
use spell effects when you're knocked
 

109
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,870
use spell effects when you're knocked
out but what about afflictions well if

110
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:22,880
out but what about afflictions well if
 

111
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,670
out but what about afflictions well if
you're suffering damage every round from

112
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:24,680
you're suffering damage every round from
 

113
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,280
you're suffering damage every round from
a poison and full unconscious bad news

114
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,290
a poison and full unconscious bad news
 

115
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,380
a poison and full unconscious bad news
but that poison is going to continue

116
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,390
but that poison is going to continue
 

117
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,540
but that poison is going to continue
damaging you every round until you

118
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,550
damaging you every round until you
 

119
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,880
damaging you every round until you
succeed under saving throws or its

120
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:33,890
succeed under saving throws or its
 

121
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,680
succeed under saving throws or its
maximum duration passes

122
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:35,690
maximum duration passes
 

123
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,140
maximum duration passes
and Amy's totals don't matter while

124
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,150
and Amy's totals don't matter while
 

125
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,300
and Amy's totals don't matter while
you're on college isn't dying so this

126
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,310
you're on college isn't dying so this
 

127
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,250
you're on college isn't dying so this
would just increase the value of your

128
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,260
would just increase the value of your
 

129
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,250
would just increase the value of your
dying condition like normal and the same

130
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,260
dying condition like normal and the same
 

131
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,410
dying condition like normal and the same
is true for persistent damage and other

132
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:47,420
is true for persistent damage and other
 

133
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,690
is true for persistent damage and other
conditions like being paralyzed being

134
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:49,700
conditions like being paralyzed being
 

135
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,670
conditions like being paralyzed being
knocked unconscious has no effect and

136
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
knocked unconscious has no effect and
 

137
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,020
knocked unconscious has no effect and
they all continue as normal

138
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,030

 

139
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,510

in the previous video we discussed the

140
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:58,520
in the previous video we discussed the
 

141
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,460
in the previous video we discussed the
Dunning condition and the unfortunate

142
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,470
Dunning condition and the unfortunate
 

143
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,770
Dunning condition and the unfortunate
result of reaching dying for is your

144
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:02,780
result of reaching dying for is your
 

145
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,460
result of reaching dying for is your
death dying for is the default dying

146
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,470
death dying for is the default dying
 

147
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,250
death dying for is the default dying
threshold but there are a couple ways to

148
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,260
threshold but there are a couple ways to
 

149
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,160
threshold but there are a couple ways to
adjust that first is through the doomed

150
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,170
adjust that first is through the doomed
 

151
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,920
adjust that first is through the doomed
condition when a character is suffering

152
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:14,930
condition when a character is suffering
 

153
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,199
condition when a character is suffering
from the doom to condition their dying

154
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,209
from the doom to condition their dying
 

155
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,410
from the doom to condition their dying
threshold is lowered by the value of the

156
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:20,420
threshold is lowered by the value of the
 

157
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,140
threshold is lowered by the value of the
doomed condition so if you get struck by

158
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,150
doomed condition so if you get struck by
 

159
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,970
doomed condition so if you get struck by
a Grim Reaper scythe you gain doomed 1

160
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:26,980
a Grim Reaper scythe you gain doomed 1
 

161
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,220
a Grim Reaper scythe you gain doomed 1
this means you will die at dying 3

162
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,230
this means you will die at dying 3
 

163
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,820
this means you will die at dying 3
instead of dying for if you get hit

164
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:33,830
instead of dying for if you get hit
 

165
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,340
instead of dying for if you get hit
