this is a portion of the initiative and

00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:09,059
this is a portion of the initiative and

this is a portion of the initiative and
surprise video that was previously

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,130
surprise video that was previously
 

9
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,060
surprise video that was previously
published that I had cut out and removed

10
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,070
published that I had cut out and removed
 

11
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,160
published that I had cut out and removed
at the eleventh hour of putting that

12
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,170
at the eleventh hour of putting that
 

13
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,460
at the eleventh hour of putting that
video together in that video I provide

14
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,470
video together in that video I provide
 

15
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,040
video together in that video I provide
four different examples of how the

16
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,050
four different examples of how the
 

17
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,410
four different examples of how the
initiative in surprise might work using

18
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,420
initiative in surprise might work using
 

19
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,170
initiative in surprise might work using
the same scenario for each of the four

20
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,180
the same scenario for each of the four
 

21
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,859
the same scenario for each of the four
different examples and originally it was

22
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:30,869
different examples and originally it was
 

23
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,979
different examples and originally it was
five examples and I actually created a

24
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:33,989
five examples and I actually created a
 

25
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,470
five examples and I actually created a
fifth example recorded audio for it put

26
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
fifth example recorded audio for it put
 

27
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,299
fifth example recorded audio for it put
all the timings into the video and so

28
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,309
all the timings into the video and so
 

29
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,880
all the timings into the video and so
forth and then in the 11th hour decided

30
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:40,890
forth and then in the 11th hour decided
 

31
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,459
forth and then in the 11th hour decided
you know what this example really has

32
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:43,469
you know what this example really has
 

33
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,889
you know what this example really has
less to do with initiative in surprise

34
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:45,899
less to do with initiative in surprise
 

35
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,310
less to do with initiative in surprise
it is really all about perception and

36
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,320
it is really all about perception and
 

37
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,270
it is really all about perception and
how perception is based on a creature to

38
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
how perception is based on a creature to
 

39
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,360
how perception is based on a creature to
creature basis instead of a universal

40
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,370
creature basis instead of a universal
 

41
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,560
creature basis instead of a universal
basis so I removed it from the published

42
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,570
basis so I removed it from the published
 

43
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,950
basis so I removed it from the published
official initiative in surprise video

44
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
official initiative in surprise video
 

45
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,359
official initiative in surprise video
but I don't know I've been sitting

46
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,369
but I don't know I've been sitting
 

47
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,270
but I don't know I've been sitting
around thinking I've made it it is

48
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,280
around thinking I've made it it is
 

49
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,539
around thinking I've made it it is
together and who knows maybe somebody

50
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:11,549
together and who knows maybe somebody
 

51
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,969
together and who knows maybe somebody
out there would find benefit in seeing

52
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:13,979
out there would find benefit in seeing
 

53
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,640
out there would find benefit in seeing
it so I've decided just to kind of

54
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,650
it so I've decided just to kind of
 

55
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,830
it so I've decided just to kind of
quickly and formally throw it together

56
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:18,840
quickly and formally throw it together
 

57
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,789
quickly and formally throw it together
and put it up and if people like seeing

58
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
and put it up and if people like seeing
 

59
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,789
and put it up and if people like seeing
a previously cut footage or small

81
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,450

let's reset the scenario one more time

82
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:54,460
let's reset the scenario one more time
 

83
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,180
let's reset the scenario one more time

119
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,530
perception DC is 17 and Marissa has a
perception DC of 16 so in this case

120
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:51,540
perception DC of 16 so in this case
 

121
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,229
