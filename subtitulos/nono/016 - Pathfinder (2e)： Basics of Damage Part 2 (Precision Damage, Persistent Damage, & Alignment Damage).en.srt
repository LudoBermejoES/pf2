level rogue performs a sneak attack with
 

175
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,090
level rogue performs a sneak attack with
a dagger it will deal 1.d4 piercing

damage for the sneak attack but these
 

181
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,730
damage for the sneak attack but these
are not two different pools of damage

182
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:11,740
are not two different pools of damage
 

183
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,370
are not two different pools of damage
you wouldn't apply one D for piercing

184
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,380
you wouldn't apply one D for piercing
 

185
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,130
you wouldn't apply one D for piercing
for the dagger and then 1 d6 precision

for the dagger and then 1 d6 precision
 

187
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,710
for the dagger and then 1 d6 precision
damage for the sneak attack instead the

damage for the sneak attack instead the
 

189
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,830
damage for the sneak attack instead the
precision damage increases the base

190
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:22,840
precision damage increases the base
 

191
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,370
precision damage increases the base
damage meaning this work would deal 1 d

separate pools of damage is important

202
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,160
separate pools of damage is important
 

203
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,830
separate pools of damage is important
when dealing with resistances and

204
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
when dealing with resistances and
 

205
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,860
when dealing with resistances and
weaknesses for example say this rogue

206
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:43,870
weaknesses for example say this rogue
 

207
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,780
weaknesses for example say this rogue
used their sneak attack against a

208
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:45,790
used their sneak attack against a
 

209
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,030
used their sneak attack against a
skeleton with resistance 5 versus

210
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,040
skeleton with resistance 5 versus
 

211
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,070
skeleton with resistance 5 versus
piercing damage if he treated the

212
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
piercing damage if he treated the
 

213
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,409
piercing damage if he treated the
piercing and precision damage separately

214
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:52,419
piercing and precision damage separately
 

215
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,230
piercing and precision damage separately
and the rogue rolled a 2 for the daggers

216
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,240
and the rogue rolled a 2 for the daggers
 

217
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,900
and the rogue rolled a 2 for the daggers
piercing damage and a 6 for the sneak

218
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:57,910
piercing damage and a 6 for the sneak
 

219
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,360
piercing damage and a 6 for the sneak
attacks precision damage you might be

220
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,370
attacks precision damage you might be
 

221
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,220
attacks precision damage you might be
tempted to say that the skeletons

222
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,230
tempted to say that the skeletons
 

223
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,100
tempted to say that the skeletons
resistance to piercing a 5 would nullify

224
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,110
resistance to piercing a 5 would nullify
 

225
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,950
resistance to piercing a 5 would nullify
the daggers damage but the skeleton

226
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:07,960
the daggers damage but the skeleton
 

227
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,320
the daggers damage but the skeleton
would still suffer the 6 precision

228
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,330
would still suffer the 6 precision
 

229
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,450
would still suffer the 6 precision
damage from the sneak attack and that's

230
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:12,460
damage from the sneak attack and that's
 

231
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,190
damage from the sneak attack and that's
not correct

232
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,200
not correct
 

233
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,650
not correct
instead precision damage raises the base

damage type of the attack that is
associated with so in this case it would

piercing damage which is then lowered by

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:30,640
piercing damage which is then lowered by
 

245
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,940
piercing damage which is then lowered by
5 due to the skeletons resistance to

246
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:32,950
5 due to the skeletons resistance to
 

247
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,210
5 due to the skeletons resistance to
piercing leaving only 3 points of damage
