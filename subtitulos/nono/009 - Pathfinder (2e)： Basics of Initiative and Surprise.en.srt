choose to group certain creatures
 

95
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,149
choose to group certain creatures
together for example if the players are

00:01:59,149 --> 00:01:59,159
together for example if the players are
 

97
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,180
together for example if the players are
fighting a bugbear in three goblins it

98
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,190
fighting a bugbear in three goblins it
 

99
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,460
fighting a bugbear in three goblins it
might be easiest for the GM to have the

100
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,470
might be easiest for the GM to have the
 

101
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,160
might be easiest for the GM to have the
bugbear act on its initiative and then

102
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,170
bugbear act on its initiative and then
 

103
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,010
bugbear act on its initiative and then
roll initiative once for all of the

104
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,020
roll initiative once for all of the
 

105
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,559
roll initiative once for all of the
other goblins acting together on their

00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:12,569
other goblins acting together on their

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,619
other goblins acting together on their
singular initiative total there is no

108
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:15,629
singular initiative total there is no
 

109
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,229
singular initiative total there is no
right or wrong approach but I would

110
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
right or wrong approach but I would
 

111
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,420
right or wrong approach but I would
caution GM's to not have too many

112
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,430
caution GM's to not have too many
 

113
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,699
caution GM's to not have too many
enemies act on the same initiative

114
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:22,709
enemies act on the same initiative
 

115
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,280
enemies act on the same initiative
number say for example the players are

116
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,290
number say for example the players are
 

117
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,520
number say for example the players are
fighting 10 goblins rolling initiative

118
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,530
fighting 10 goblins rolling initiative
 

119
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,850
fighting 10 goblins rolling initiative
once in having all 10 goblins act at the

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:31,860
once in having all 10 goblins act at the
 

121
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,240
once in having all 10 goblins act at the
same time can be pretty brutal as the

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,250
same time can be pretty brutal as the
 

123
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,670

125
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,830

that large you might want to break it up

that large you might want to break it up
 

131
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,470
that large you might want to break it up
into say 2 groups of 5 or maybe break it

into say 2 groups of 5 or maybe break it
 

133

135
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,839
up as 2 groups of 3 and one group of 4
as opposed to having all 10 act at the

throw off some experienced players
 

165
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,379
throw off some experienced players
especially if they played first edition

especially if they played first edition
 

167
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,830

and that means there's no need to call

494
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:52,069
and that means there's no need to call
 

495
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,389
and that means there's no need to call
for initiative to be enrolled now let's

496
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:55,399
for initiative to be enrolled now let's
 

497
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,550
for initiative to be enrolled now let's
see how this might be different if the

00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,560
see how this might be different if the
 

499
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,740
see how this might be different if the

503
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,160
