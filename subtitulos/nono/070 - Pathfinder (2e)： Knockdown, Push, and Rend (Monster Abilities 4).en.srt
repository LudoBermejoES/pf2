melee attacks
also note that this cover bonus while

94
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
also note that this cover bonus while
 

95
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,789
also note that this cover bonus while
prone only applies to armor class and

96
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
prone only applies to armor class and
 

97
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,030
prone only applies to armor class and
does not apply to reflex savings throws

98
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
does not apply to reflex savings throws
 

99
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,830
does not apply to reflex savings throws
like with the normal greater cover bonus

100
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
like with the normal greater cover bonus
 

101
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,910
like with the normal greater cover bonus
so the key to using knockdown is to

102
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
so the key to using knockdown is to
 

103
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,109
so the key to using knockdown is to
remember it costs

104
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
remember it costs
 

105
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,109
remember it costs
two actions one to attack with an

106
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
two actions one to attack with an
 

107
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,789
two actions one to attack with an
ability that includes knockdown in its

108
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
ability that includes knockdown in its
 

109
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,749
ability that includes knockdown in its
damage entry

110
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
damage entry
 

111
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,310
damage entry
and if that hits you can spend a second

112
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
and if that hits you can spend a second
 

113
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,710
and if that hits you can spend a second
action to apply prone to the target

114
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
action to apply prone to the target
 

115
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,429
action to apply prone to the target
this is with normal knockdown but there

116
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
this is with normal knockdown but there
 

117
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:55,830
this is with normal knockdown but there
is an

118
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
is an
 

119
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,310
is an
advanced form called improved knockdown

120
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
advanced form called improved knockdown
 

121
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,230
advanced form called improved knockdown
which works exactly like a regular

122
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
which works exactly like a regular
 

123
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,789
which works exactly like a regular
knockdown

124
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
knockdown
 

125
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,350
knockdown
except it can be used as a free action

126
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
except it can be used as a free action
 

127
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,350
except it can be used as a free action
so basically when an attack hits with

128
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
so basically when an attack hits with
 

129
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,590
so basically when an attack hits with
improved knockdown then in that case the

130
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
improved knockdown then in that case the
 

131
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,550
improved knockdown then in that case the
target is

132
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
target is
 

133
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,550
target is
automatically rendered prone

134
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560

 

135
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,869

next up we have push which functions a

136
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
next up we have push which functions a
 

137
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,630
next up we have push which functions a
lot like knock down and grab

138
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
lot like knock down and grab
 

139
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,790
lot like knock down and grab
when you see an attack that has a damage

140
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
when you see an attack that has a damage
 

141
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,830
when you see an attack that has a damage
entry that says

142
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
entry that says
 

143
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,790
entry that says
plus push x mini feet it doesn't mean

144
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
plus push x mini feet it doesn't mean
 

145
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,150
plus push x mini feet it doesn't mean
that the target of the attack is

146
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
that the target of the attack is
 

147
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,670
that the target of the attack is
automatically pushed back when they're

148
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
automatically pushed back when they're
 

149
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,229
automatically pushed back when they're
hit

150
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
hit
 

151
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,830
hit
it means that the monster who made the

152
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
it means that the monster who made the
 

153
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,750
it means that the monster who made the
attack has the option of spending

154
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
attack has the option of spending
 

155
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,630
attack has the option of spending
one action more in order to apply the

156
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
one action more in order to apply the
 

157
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,030
one action more in order to apply the
push

158
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
push
 

159
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,910
push
effect and if they have improved push

160
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
effect and if they have improved push
 

161
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,670
effect and if they have improved push
instead of regular push then it works

162
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
instead of regular push then it works
 

163
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,110
instead of regular push then it works
just like with knockdown and improved

164
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
just like with knockdown and improved
 

165
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,910
just like with knockdown and improved
knockdown

166
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
knockdown
 

167
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,309
knockdown
meaning improved push can be used as a

168
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
meaning improved push can be used as a
 

169
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,509
meaning improved push can be used as a
free action

170
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
free action
 

171
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,030
free action
if the monster does apply the push

172
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
if the monster does apply the push
 

173
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,949
if the monster does apply the push
effect then the target of the attack is

174
