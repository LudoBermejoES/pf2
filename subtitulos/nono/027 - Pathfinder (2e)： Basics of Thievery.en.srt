although thief tools are required to

although thief tools are required to
 

445
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,110

to use improvised tools I think the
 

449
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,060
to use improvised tools I think the
classic example of this is using a

450
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,070
classic example of this is using a
 

451
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,300
classic example of this is using a
hairpin to pick a lock in this case the

452

hairpin to pick a lock in this case the
 

453
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,300
hairpin to pick a lock in this case the
improvised lock picks are treated as if

improvised lock picks are treated as if
they are shoddy tools which means the
