next you need to calculate the game's

260
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
next you need to calculate the game's
 

261
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,869
next you need to calculate the game's
party level which is easy if all the

00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
party level which is easy if all the
 

263
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,470

players are the same level

players are the same level
 

265
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,869
players are the same level
but if you have some pcs who are higher

266
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
but if you have some pcs who are higher
 

267
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,710
but if you have some pcs who are higher
or lower than the others in the group

00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
or lower than the others in the group
 

269
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,030

then it's a little more complicated if

270
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
then it's a little more complicated if
 

271
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,870
then it's a little more complicated if
everyone playing is the same character

then that is also their party level
that's what i do and i

that's what i do and i

then set the party level as equal to the

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
then set the party level as equal to the
 

305
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,310

that case
 

315
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,909

you would set the party level as fifth

you would set the party level as fifth

then set the party level as the lowest

322
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
then set the party level as the lowest
 

323
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,629
then set the party level as the lowest

the party level would be
third but you would add one extra

third but you would add one extra
 

341
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,029
