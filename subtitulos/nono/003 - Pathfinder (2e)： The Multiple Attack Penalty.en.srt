97
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,569
example if we look at the description
for strike we see that it doesn't make

98
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:02,579
for strike we see that it doesn't make
 

99
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,490
for strike we see that it doesn't make
any mention of this multiple attack

100
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,500
any mention of this multiple attack
 

101
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,130
any mention of this multiple attack
penalty but it does have the attack

102
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,140
penalty but it does have the attack
 

103
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,190
penalty but it does have the attack
trait and it is this trait that notes

104
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
trait and it is this trait that notes
 

105
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,050
trait and it is this trait that notes
was affected by the multiple attack

106
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,060
was affected by the multiple attack
 

107
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,030
was affected by the multiple attack
penalty let's take a look at a few

108
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,040
penalty let's take a look at a few
 

109
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,850
penalty let's take a look at a few
examples the acid aerospell has the

110
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:16,860
examples the acid aerospell has the
 

111
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,670
examples the acid aerospell has the
attack trait therefore it does suffer

112
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
attack trait therefore it does suffer
 

113
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,070
attack trait therefore it does suffer
from the multiple attack penalty if a

114
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
from the multiple attack penalty if a
 

115
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,170
from the multiple attack penalty if a
sorcerer wanted to strike an enemy with

116
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,180
sorcerer wanted to strike an enemy with
 

117
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,869
sorcerer wanted to strike an enemy with
their staff using their first action and

118
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
their staff using their first action and
 

119
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,150
their staff using their first action and
then cast acid Arrow at another Target

120
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,160
then cast acid Arrow at another Target
 

121
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,850
then cast acid Arrow at another Target
with their second and third actions then

122
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:31,860
with their second and third actions then
 

123
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,430
with their second and third actions then
the staff attack would suffer no penalty

124
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
the staff attack would suffer no penalty
 

125
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,589
the staff attack would suffer no penalty
because it's the first attack made in

126
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:36,599
because it's the first attack made in
 

127
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,809
because it's the first attack made in
that turn but there would be a negative

128
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:38,819
that turn but there would be a negative
 

129
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,910
that turn but there would be a negative
five penalty applied to the casting of

130
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920
five penalty applied to the casting of
 

131
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,550
five penalty applied to the casting of
acid Arrow it would be considered the

132
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,560
acid Arrow it would be considered the
 

133
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,949
acid Arrow it would be considered the
second use of an attack action for that

134
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:45,959
second use of an attack action for that
 

135
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,430
second use of an attack action for that
turn even though it caused two actions

136
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
turn even though it caused two actions
 

137
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,630
turn even though it caused two actions
to use

138
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
to use
 

139
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,250
to use
just for the sake of comparison let's

140
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,260
just for the sake of comparison let's
 

141
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,470
just for the sake of comparison let's
take a look at another spell electric

142
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
take a look at another spell electric
 

143
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,410
take a look at another spell electric
Arc it's similar to acid arrow in that

144
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:57,420
Arc it's similar to acid arrow in that
 

145
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,869
Arc it's similar to acid arrow in that
it's a spell that deals a type of energy

attack penalty would not apply here
 

151
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,150
attack penalty would not apply here
because electric Arc does not have the

152
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,160
because electric Arc does not have the
 

153
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,550
because electric Arc does not have the
attack trait and it also wouldn't apply

154
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
attack trait and it also wouldn't apply
 

155
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,710
attack trait and it also wouldn't apply
because electric Arc does not call for

suffer from the multiple attack penalty
if a player tries to trip an enemy and

then stab them while they're prone there
would be no penalty for the trip but

would be no penalty for the trip but
 

179
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,910
would be no penalty for the trip but
there would be a negative five penalty

there would be a negative five penalty
 

181
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,130
there would be a negative five penalty
applied to the attack or negative four

no penalty for the first Athletics check
 

193
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,570
no penalty for the first Athletics check
rolled for shove but there would be a

so yes these kinds of combat Maneuvers
and athletic skill checks are

and athletic skill checks are
 

203
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,369
and athletic skill checks are
technically considered attacks and they

00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:13,379
technically considered attacks and they
 

205
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,869
technically considered attacks and they
do suffer from the multiple attack

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,650
skill check is very important because it
means that anything that modifies attack

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:39,660
means that anything that modifies attack
 

225
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,710
