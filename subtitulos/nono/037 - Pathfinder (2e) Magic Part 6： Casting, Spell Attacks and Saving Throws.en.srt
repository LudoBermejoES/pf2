a spell is disrupted not only is that
action lost

action lost
 

179
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,710
action lost
but the spell that you are attempting to

180
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
but the spell that you are attempting to
 

181
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,350
but the spell that you are attempting to
sustain immediately ends

182
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360

another important consideration on
 

185
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,390
another important consideration on
casting spells is line

186
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
casting spells is line
 

187
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,869
casting spells is line

ranged attacks
 

191
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,149
ranged attacks
but can be especially noteworthy when it

00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
but can be especially noteworthy when it
 

193
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,670
but can be especially noteworthy when it
comes to spells

194
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
comes to spells
 

195
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,670
comes to spells
line of effect means there is an

196
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
line of effect means there is an
 

197
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,910
line of effect means there is an
unobstructed path to the target

198
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
unobstructed path to the target
 

199
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,309
unobstructed path to the target
and generally as long as the target is

200
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
and generally as long as the target is
 

201
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,390
and generally as long as the target is
not behind a solid wall

202
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
not behind a solid wall
 

203
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,030
not behind a solid wall
that blocks all physical axes to them

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
that blocks all physical axes to them
 

205
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,990
that blocks all physical axes to them
then you have

206
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
then you have
 

207
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,509
then you have
line of effect when you cast any spell

208
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
line of effect when you cast any spell
 

209

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,309
not just spell attacks you must have
line of effect to the target

those enemies also need to have a line

those enemies also need to have a line

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,670
those enemies also need to have a line

penalties
 

299
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,909
penalties
that affect attack roles for example

that affect attack roles for example
 

301
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,469
that affect attack roles for example
victims of a bane spell suffer a

attack roles this does include spell
 

307
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,710
attack roles this does include spell
attack roles too whatever effects say

308
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
attack roles too whatever effects say
 

309
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,830
attack roles too whatever effects say
that they modify

310
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
that they modify
 

311
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,150

just attacks without specifying a

specific type of attack
 

315
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,029
specific type of attack
affect spell attacks too but if the

316
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
affect spell attacks too but if the
 

317
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,590
affect spell attacks too but if the
effect calls out a specific type of

318
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
effect calls out a specific type of

attack
 

321
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,430
attack
like weapon attacks then obviously those

322
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
like weapon attacks then obviously those
 

323
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,150
like weapon attacks then obviously those
would not apply to spill attacks

324
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
would not apply to spill attacks
 

325
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,790
would not apply to spill attacks
now one specific penalty that definitely

326
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
now one specific penalty that definitely
 

327
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,150
now one specific penalty that definitely
needs to be discussed

328
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
needs to be discussed
 

329
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,870
needs to be discussed
is the multiple attack penalty this

330
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
is the multiple attack penalty this
 

331
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,670
is the multiple attack penalty this
applies

332
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
applies
 

333
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,110
applies
to all actions with the attack trait

334
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
to all actions with the attack trait
 

335
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,230
to all actions with the attack trait
for example acid arrow requires a spell

336
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
for example acid arrow requires a spell
 

337
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,710
for example acid arrow requires a spell
attack role and has the attack trait

338
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
attack role and has the attack trait
 

339
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,029
attack role and has the attack trait
therefore it is affected by and

340
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
therefore it is affected by and
 

341
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,469
therefore it is affected by and
contributes to

342
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
contributes to
 

343
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,270
contributes to
the multiple attack penalty but on the

344
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
the multiple attack penalty but on the
 

345
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,150
the multiple attack penalty but on the
other hand

346
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
other hand
 

347
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,029
other hand
let's look at tanglefoot it also

348
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
