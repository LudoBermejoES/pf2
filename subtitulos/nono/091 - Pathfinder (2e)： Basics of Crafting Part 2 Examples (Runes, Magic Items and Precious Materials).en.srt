now to begin crafting we need to provide

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,300
now to begin crafting we need to provide

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,110
now to begin crafting we need to provide
fifty percent of the price up front in

fifty percent of the price up front in
 

279

fifty percent of 2400 is 1200 gold if we

282
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:47,800
fifty percent of 2400 is 1200 gold if we
 

283
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,070
fifty percent of 2400 is 1200 gold if we
look back at the step block for the

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
look back at the step block for the
 

285
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,130
look back at the step block for the
adamantine armor we see it requires that

286
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,140
adamantine armor we see it requires that
 

287
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,850
adamantine armor we see it requires that
the initial raw materials must include

again this suit of armor is five bulk

again this suit of armor is five bulk
 

293
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,920
again this suit of armor is five bulk
five times 20 is 100 so that means

294
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:07,930
five times 20 is 100 so that means
 

295
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,500
five times 20 is 100 so that means
before because our crafting we need

out-of-pocket since it's assumed that we
can find these basic materials just

can find these basic materials just
 

309
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,510
can find these basic materials just
about anywhere but adamantine is

about anywhere but adamantine is

about anywhere but adamantine is
uncommon we can't just go to a store and

uncommon we can't just go to a store and
buy it most likely we received a chunk

buy it most likely we received a chunk
 

315
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,570
buy it most likely we received a chunk
of adamantine as part of the treasure

of adamantine as part of the treasure
 

317

329
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,780
days working after which there is a
skill check and if we succeed that check

330
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:57,790
skill check and if we succeed that check
 

331
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,240

downtime working to lower that balance
 

337
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,360
downtime working to lower that balance
just note that if we decide to pay off

338
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,370
just note that if we decide to pay off
 

339
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,060
just note that if we decide to pay off
the balance none of that needs to
