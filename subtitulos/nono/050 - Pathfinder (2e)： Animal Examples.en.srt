have a +6 bonus to this attack but this
 

235
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,650
have a +6 bonus to this attack but this
time it only gets a +2 bonus because

236
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:52,660
time it only gets a +2 bonus because

attack rolls are a type of check and
therefore the bonus is reduced by 4

240

therefore the bonus is reduced by 4
 

241
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,210
therefore the bonus is reduced by 4
because of the frightened 4 condition

because of the frightened 4 condition
this still leaves one action left for

there's a couple of different ways to

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,170
there's a couple of different ways to
handle this and by raw an argument could

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,209
handle this and by raw an argument could
be made that it would stop after its

be made that it would stop after its

be made that it would stop after its

it's worth I think the right call is
