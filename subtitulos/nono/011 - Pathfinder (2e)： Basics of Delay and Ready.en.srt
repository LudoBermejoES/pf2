00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,090
2nd edition in the previous course we
 

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,120
2nd edition in the previous course we
discussed how initiative is used to

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,130
discussed how initiative is used to
 

9
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,709
discussed how initiative is used to
determine the order in which characters

10
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
determine the order in which characters
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,560
determine the order in which characters
act during encounters and this video is

12
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:15,570
act during encounters and this video is
 

13
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,210
act during encounters and this video is
going to follow up on that by discussing

14
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:17,220
going to follow up on that by discussing
 

15
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,279
going to follow up on that by discussing
two of the most common ways that

16
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:19,289
two of the most common ways that
 

17
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,200
two of the most common ways that
characters can adjust when they act

18
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,210
characters can adjust when they act
 

19
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,480
characters can adjust when they act
within that order

20
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,490

 

21
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,790

the first is by using the delay action

22
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
the first is by using the delay action
 

23
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,820
the first is by using the delay action
at the start of a player's turn if they

24
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:29,830
at the start of a player's turn if they
 

25
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,250
at the start of a player's turn if they
don't know what they want to do or if

26
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,260
don't know what they want to do or if
 

27
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,050
don't know what they want to do or if
they believe it would be better if one

28
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,060
they believe it would be better if one
 

29
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,360
they believe it would be better if one
of their allies went before them then

30
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,370
of their allies went before them then
 

31
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,490
of their allies went before them then
they may choose to delay their action

32
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:38,500
they may choose to delay their action
 

33
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,430
they may choose to delay their action
when a player delays the essentially

34
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
when a player delays the essentially
 

35
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,500
when a player delays the essentially
step aside as far as initiative is

36
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,510
step aside as far as initiative is
 

37
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,979
step aside as far as initiative is
concerned and allow others to pass them

38
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:45,989
concerned and allow others to pass them
 

39
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,570
concerned and allow others to pass them
after each other character finishes

40
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:48,580
after each other character finishes
 

41
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,670
after each other character finishes
their turn the delaying player may

42
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:50,680
their turn the delaying player may
 

43
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,229
their turn the delaying player may
announce that they are done waiting and

44
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
announce that they are done waiting and
 

45
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,420
announce that they are done waiting and
wish to jump back into the initiative

46
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:54,430
wish to jump back into the initiative
 

47
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,420
wish to jump back into the initiative
order there at that time they take their

48
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,430
order there at that time they take their
 

49
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,420
order there at that time they take their
entire turn meaning all three of their

entire turn meaning all three of their
 

51
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,330
entire turn meaning all three of their
actions and from that point forward for

52
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,340
actions and from that point forward for
 

53
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,370
actions and from that point forward for
the rest of the encounter they use this

54
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:05,380
the rest of the encounter they use this
 

55
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,060
the rest of the encounter they use this

that's it in a nutshell but there are a
 

105
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,140
that's it in a nutshell but there are a
few other specifics that are worth

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,150
few other specifics that are worth
 

107
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,750
few other specifics that are worth
mentioning first when you declare that

108
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
mentioning first when you declare that
 

109
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,970
mentioning first when you declare that
you are delaying you effectively step

110
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:17,980
you are delaying you effectively step
 

111
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,340
you are delaying you effectively step
out of the initiative order while doing

out of the initiative order while doing
 

113
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,150
out of the initiative order while doing
this you cannot take any reactions so if

114
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
this you cannot take any reactions so if
 

115
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,800
this you cannot take any reactions so if
an enemy does something that would

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:25,810
an enemy does something that would
 

117
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,810
an enemy does something that would
normally provoke one of your reactions

normally provoke one of your reactions
 

119
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,330
normally provoke one of your reactions
while you are delaying then you're out

you have to wait until you finish

you have to wait until you finish
delaying and move back into the proper

reason one way this distinction is
 

385
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,219
reason one way this distinction is
important is it means you still have one

and then use your remaining two actions
 

405
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,240
