to gallop you would need to spend two of
your actions to do so you then make a

up straight offense and then leap over
it you would spend three actions to do

it you would spend three actions to do
 

285
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,210
it you would spend three actions to do
so but because stand stride and leap are

all basic actions they can sort of be
 

289
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,910
all basic actions they can sort of be
bundled together and you would only need

bundled together and you would only need
 

291
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,790

it would suffer a negative for penalty

attack hits misses does damage or
 

425
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,150
attack hits misses does damage or
doesn't do damage then the animal

doesn't do damage then the animal
 

427
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,179
doesn't do damage then the animal
becomes frightened for again and also

428
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:55,189
becomes frightened for again and also
 

429
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:58,780
becomes frightened for again and also
therefore becomes fleeing again the only

430
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:58,790
therefore becomes fleeing again the only
 

431
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,449
therefore becomes fleeing again the only
exceptions to this panic that are called

432
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:01,459
exceptions to this panic that are called
 

433
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,220
exceptions to this panic that are called
out in the core rules are animals that

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,230
out in the core rules are animals that
 

435
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,290
out in the core rules are animals that
have been specifically trained for

436
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,300
have been specifically trained for
 

437
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,800
have been specifically trained for
battle such as war horses and war ponies

438
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:08,810
battle such as war horses and war ponies
 

439
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,230
battle such as war horses and war ponies
but I would assume that any animal

440
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,240
but I would assume that any animal
 

441
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,819
but I would assume that any animal
that's being used by the GM as an

442
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:12,829
that's being used by the GM as an
 

443
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,179
that's being used by the GM as an
adversary such as a bear or rats warms

444
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:16,189
adversary such as a bear or rats warms
 

445
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:18,790
adversary such as a bear or rats warms
or giant scorpions that they would all

446
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
or giant scorpions that they would all
 

447
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,670
or giant scorpions that they would all
be immune to this panic as well

448

449
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,519

so this might raise the question of how

450
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:25,529
so this might raise the question of how
 

451
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,799
so this might raise the question of how
do you prevent your dog from running off

452
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:27,809
do you prevent your dog from running off
 

453
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,530
do you prevent your dog from running off
at the first sign of danger the rules

454
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,540
at the first sign of danger the rules
 

455
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,929
at the first sign of danger the rules
say the following if you successfully

456
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:32,939
say the following if you successfully
 

457
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:36,470
say the following if you successfully
command your animal using nature you can

458
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
command your animal using nature you can
 

459
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
command your animal using nature you can
keep it from fleeing though this doesn't

460
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,730
keep it from fleeing though this doesn't
 

461
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,869
keep it from fleeing though this doesn't
remove is frightened condition this is a

00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:41,879
remove is frightened condition this is a
 

463
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,999
remove is frightened condition this is a
little bit of unusual warning and has

464
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:44,009
little bit of unusual warning and has
 

465
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,280
little bit of unusual warning and has
caused some discussion online over the

466
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,290
caused some discussion online over the
 

467
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,280
caused some discussion online over the
intent I'm going to provide you how I

468
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,290
intent I'm going to provide you how I
 

469
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,769
intent I'm going to provide you how I
think it is supposed to work and just

470
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:51,779
think it is supposed to work and just
 

471
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,840
think it is supposed to work and just
make a mental note here that this is one

472
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:53,850
make a mental note here that this is one
 

473
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,119
make a mental note here that this is one
person's interpretation and if an

official source clarifies this I will

476
00:10:58,609 --> 00:10:58,619
official source clarifies this I will
 

477
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,530
official source clarifies this I will
update this video accordingly

478
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:00,540
update this video accordingly
 

479
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,319
update this video accordingly
I believe the intent is if you

480
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:03,329
I believe the intent is if you
 

481
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,329
I believe the intent is if you
successfully command a frightened animal

482
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:05,339
successfully command a frightened animal
 

483
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,840
successfully command a frightened animal
to do anything then it loses the fleeing

484
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:08,850
to do anything then it loses the fleeing
 

485
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,359
to do anything then it loses the fleeing
condition for that round for example you

486
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:11,369
condition for that round for example you
 

487
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,220
condition for that round for example you
could spend one action to command the

488
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,230
could spend one action to command the
 

489
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,059
could spend one action to command the
animal destroyed 15 feet and stop on its

490
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:17,069
animal destroyed 15 feet and stop on its
 

491
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:19,850
animal destroyed 15 feet and stop on its
turn the animal would do so with its

492
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
turn the animal would do so with its
 

493
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,400
turn the animal would do so with its
first action and would not spend its

494
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,410
first action and would not spend its
 

495
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,639
first action and would not spend its
