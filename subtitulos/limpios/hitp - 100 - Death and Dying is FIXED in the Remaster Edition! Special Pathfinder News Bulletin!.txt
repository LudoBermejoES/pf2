[Music] hey everybody Dave here and I just wanted to get out a very quick update in regard to the brand new remaster editions that released officially today um and especially in regards to one piece of information that was delivered in my previous video about the remaster editions where I answered uh questions from the community about it um today along with the release of those two new books they also released and updated on their website list of verada for both player core and GM core as well as some remaster updates to other existing books like the advanced players guide and if you saw my video on the uh questions that were being answered about the remaster editions you know that my my number one concern um the number one change that I was really kind of upset about was that they had made uh the death and dying rules much much much more lethal uh for those who are not familiar in the original release of uh Second Edition there was some conflicting language uh both in the player or the core rule book as well as the uh beginners box set where in some places it said that you only add your wounded value to your dying value uh at the time that you're knocked unconscious in other places said that you added your wounded condition to your dying value basically every time you fall unconscious plus every time you fail a recovery check plus every time you take additional damage while unconscious which essentially meant that if you had a wounded value of one and you fail even one recovery check you you die um and that's probably not great uh I had expressed a lot of concerns about what this was going to mean to new players ERS who come in and are trying to learn the system and find out that they're having a tbk right off the bat it's a real good way to to ruin a new players fun but here's I guess the good news in the newly released ARA to the new player core book they include this passage Pages 411 the text for the wounded condition was changed for consistency but became consistent with the wrong piece of textt which I think is an interesting an interesting way to phrase it in an interesting mistake uh and I'm not sure how this slips past QA but uh so be it that's what it says it goes on to say this would lead to much deadlier encounters I believe so the following changes should ensure that death and dying works the way we intended in the recovery checks degrees of success remove all instances of that parenthetical that says plus your wounded condition of any that's both in the failure and critical failure entries under taking damage remove the final sentence that reads if you have the wounded condition remember to add the value of your wounded condition to your dying value this reminder should only apply to when you gain the dying condition after getting knocked out so I believe with this official AA it does put it back in line with what I originally thought the rule was what my videos that deal with death dying in the wooden condition say and that is you only apply the value of your wounded condition to your dying condition at the time you become unconscious and not again when you fail or critically fail a recovery check or take additional damage so uh that's it for tonight I just wanted to get out a very quick video to let everybody know that because this is a a topic that has generated a lot of conversation uh both on the comment section of my previous remaster video as well as all over the forums and reddits and every and every place else and of course thank you to everybody who supports me whether that's by clicking the like button subscribing to the channel subscribing to the patreon buying a super thanks I appreciate everything you folks do to support me thanks for watching take care and happy [Music] game [Music]
