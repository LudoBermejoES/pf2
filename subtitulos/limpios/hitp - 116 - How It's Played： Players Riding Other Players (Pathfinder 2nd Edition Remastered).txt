hey everybody Dave here with another Pathfinder rule reminder for you and today's question is about players writing upon other players with the release of how of the wild we now have large size ancestries that players can play so this specific scenario involves what if we have two players one of them is a human that's mediumsized and the other is a minur which is large size what are the rules for the human player to ride upon their large siiz minur friend into combat and so let's take a look at these rules the rules are provided in Hall of the wild the same book that gives us the new large size ancestries and it's on page nine and the first thing that uh this rule says is a PC can write on another PC as long as the second PC is at least two size categories larger than them so this is a little different than the rules we've seen before and and before Hall of the wild when you looked at any information uh for example the mount action uh it would specifically say that you used it to get upon a creature that was one size category larger than you so that right there is going to invalidate the scenario of a medium-size human riding on a large siiz Minotaur because that's only a on siiz category difference uh instead what we would have to have is a small size character wanting to ride upon the minur so uh that would be a halfling for example or a goblin anything the small size leesy whatever writing upon the um the minur uh I actually think the the the new moon uh Heritage uh seren are like Smalls siiz minotaurs so you could even have some bizarre situation of a small-sized minur riding upon a large siiz minur shoulder players don't get up to Wacky stuff with uh with with these rules and that's one possibility but uh anyway uh I think the reason that the previous uh rules always refer to two- size categories larger is because they were specifically talking about creatures that were intended to be mounts these are typically long creatures instead of tall creatures and typically quadrupeds so even though the roles didn't you know specify that you had to be long instead of tall and you had to have four limbs to walking Pond instead of two uh that was what the Assumption was so we're talking horses or riding dogs uh you Wars for goblins stuff like that but now that is actually PCS who are typically going to be by pedal we have a new set of rules so that's the first part uh you have to be two size categories larger for that to serve as um a creature to be ridden upon here it also says this requires a tremendous amount of coordination to ensure the smaller PC doesn't get in the way or the two PCS don't jostle each other into losing actions as a result for most parties this tactic is less favorable than the smaller PC just using their amount and yeah and as I go through this it's I think it's going become more and more clear that um there's not a lot of mechanical benefit to uh to having one PC ride upon another uh especially in combat so why would they do this answer is simple because it's fun because it's cool because it's narratively interesting uh those are the reasons why players are going to want to engage in these rules not because in most cases uh there might be one little Fringe area we'll talk about in a bit but in in certainly in most cases there's not going to be a uh a distinct mechanical benefit to doing this um I think right off the bat the most the most clear downside to this is you're now occupa occupying the same space on the board which means uh if someone wants to hit you with an AOE they only have to hit one of your your squares instead of being able to set the cone or the burst or whatever so it's hitting two different squares so that right off the bat is a downside at doing this but uh let's go ahead and see what else it says here if a PC who is at least two sizes smaller rides along with with another PC or similar non minion intelligent creature roll both their initiatives and use the lower of the two results the two PCS act in either order on the same initiative count so what the raw is saying here is uh it doesn't matter what order you roll your initiatives in between the person writing and the characters being written upon they both roll their initiatives as normal but you take the lower of the two in every round those two characters can take their actions in either order but my reading of the rule would be that uh whichever one goes first they resolve all of their actions they they resolve their entire turn and then the other character resolves all of their actions in their turn separately not intermingling those actions together and it continues on to say while traveling in this way the PCS gain two actions at the start of their turns instead of three since the larger PC spends one action keeping the smaller one balanced on their back and the smaller PC spends one action maintaining their grip there's not a whole lot of of benefit to do this mechanically the benefit in doing this is is going to be uh narrative because it's fun because it's cool because it might be awesome to be a halfling pursed on your buddy's shoulder your minur buddy shoulder and you're holding a hor with one hand and you're whacking people with a mace as he runs past them with the other uh mechanically not going to give you a lot of benefit but it's that it's that it's that narrative moment that you might appreciate and the last bit of text says some ancestry specialize in being able to carry smaller riders or have Feats to enable this such as Centaur so that's the guidance we have in raw for writing PCS you must have uh two size C atories different and both those people are going to be reduced to only having two actions per turn uh as basically they're each losing one action in favor of either not accidentally throwing a person off or or holding on for deer life and staying on that minur shoulder or what have you um and initiative is going to be at the lowest of their two roles but every round round as I read it they can swap so like maybe one round is most advantageous for the writer to go first and then the the character being ridden to go next or in the next round they could swap that order and go the other way so let's talk about those special situations like the centur so centur if we look at their ancestry they have a special feature called Mount and it says your ecoin body is well suited for caring trusted allies a piece PC can ride you if they are one size category smaller than you rather than needing to be two size category smaller so if the PC that is being written upon is like a centur and has the mount feature as part of their ancestory then you only have to be one siiz category different so a medium-sized human could ride a centur that large size whereas they could not if it was a minur in that case the minor would just be carrying the mediumsized creature like anything else and there's an additional optional feat that uh that the centur players can pick up at level five and it's called accommodating Mount you've trained to serve as a mount if only for your most trusted allies when another PC writes you as a mount your expert coordination allows them to gain three actions at the start of their turn rather than the two they would normally for writing another PC you still gain only two actions at the start of your turn in so three as you spend one action keeping them balanced on your back in ensuring they're firmly mounted so um so if you do want to lighten the load a little bit of the rule that says you only are going to start each turn with two actions instead of the normal three then the Centaur player could get accommodating amount to to offset that a little bit by giving the person rotting upon them their fourth reactions so there are a number of other things that we might want to look at uh questions that come up um in regard to this and I will say there's going to have to be a little bit of GM interpretation for a lot of this GM is going to have to think about the rules as written and the rules as intended or interpreted and uh what's going to be most uh most narratively satisfying and most importantly fun for your players as you figure out how to use each of these rules but the first is going to be the question about bulk so if uh if one player is writing upon another player uh do we need to enforce bulk rules I would assume so and so uh if you want to know what the bulk of a character is that's going to be found in player core one there's a table on page 269 that gives you sort of a rough average bulk for a creature by uh size category and then you would just take the additional B that that character is carrying add those two numbers together and that would be the bulk of what the uh the creature being ridden upon is now having to accommodate another question would be about mounted Feats so especially if maybe like you're you're a Cavalier you might have a lot of Feats that they that give you special abilities and features while you are mounted so how does this apply to riding another piece c um the section on running PC doesn't really go into this so again this is going to be a place where hgms going to have to make their own rulings um I think a lot of the mounted Feats uh are definitely are probably going to apply when you are riding upon a creature that has the mount feature like a centaur um and may not apply to when you're writing another creature or another PC uh you'll notice the section on writing PC uh doesn't use the term Mount anywhere doesn't say that you use the mount action to get onto or off of the creature that you're riding upon it doesn't refer to the creature you're riding upon as a quote Mount um so uh a lot of the Feats that give you bonuses to being mounted uh I think GMS are well within their right to say like I don't think it's going to defend the situation where you're writing on perched on the shoulder of a minur uh versus the um versus a on the back of a centaur but again do what's going to be uh narratively satisfying and fun for your players as long as it doesn't break the game uh another thing to keep in mind is a lot of these Mount Feats or no not a lot but some of them certainly imply that the person who is writing is also controlling the creature they're riding upon and that's not going to be the case when you're riding upon another PC that the PC that's being written upon is going to maintain their full agency and do what they want to move where they want to go so those Feats for mounted combat may not apply here either so what about things like in mounted combat it talks about cover well this is an area that I think probably would apply to when you're riding up a PC even though they don't have the mount trait it may not officially be called a mount uh just because it makes sense to me uh those cover rules are that the rider receives a a basically receives lesser cover from the creature they're riding upon that's going to be a plus one AC but it also says that they are going to suffer a negative2 to their reflex saves uh simply because they're not in control entirely of being able to dodge out of the way of things at the mercy of what they're what they're riding upon kind of a Akin to that especially with reflex an area of a attacks uh do do you as a rider occupy all the same spaces as the creature you're riding upon the section on writing PCS doesn't go into this uh but the section on mounted combat does specifically say that uh if you're mounted on a creature that's larger than you then you occupy your tree is occupying all the same scores as they are I would assume this is the same for when you are riding a PC uh instead of having to choose which of the four specific squares a large creature occupies for your Square you would be treated as occupying all of all four of those squares at the same time another quick question is about reach um in mounted combat it says you got to have 15 feet of reach to attack two squares away instead of 10 feet of reach to attack two squares away if you're are ridning upon a mount that is size large uh wouldn't apply if you're like a small siiz character riding on a uh mediumsized U you know uh riding dog or work or something like that I would assume that's going to apply here um so even though that this is again we're not entire I'm not entirely certain if you know where we draw the line between writing a PC and them being a mount other than centaurs having the mount trait I think rules like this will still apply how about using a jousting weapon uh jousting weapons uh are used on mounts and what it is is you can either use the the jousting weapon for example a lance with two hands and do its regular damage in the case of a lance that would be a d8 weapon die or you can joust with it which means you can hold it in one hand and have your other hand fore to hold a shield um and it does uh in the case of a lance it does a D6 damage wielded one hand instead of instead of U 1d8 for two hands I would assume that you would have to do that uh when you're riding on another creature using the example of a halfling on a menur uh they can't wield a two-handed weapon they'd have to have one hand on on minotaur's Horns or whatever to hold themselves study and then they would Jou with the other now the the tricky area here is jeling weapons say that if you move at least 10 feet on the action immediately before you make a a a strike with your Lance then you're going to get a bonus of damage equal to the number of weapon dice so in in using a regular Lance uh that's that'd be 1 D6 damage jousting you would get a plus one that damage if the if the mount that you're runting upon moves at least 10 feet on the action immediately before you make strike so that's the piece that by raw gets really fuzzy here because the rules for jousting and for mounts uh assume that you as the rider you're controlling the mount and so on your turn you're controlling where the mount goes and how the and how that action economy spent is spent but with the rules for writing a PC one creature completely takes all their actions and completely resolves their turn and then the next creature does or the next player does so that makes it a little more difficult to say that um if if the if the creature being ridden upon takes their actions first uh does this mean that they have to spend their last action on stride and the first action of the next character's turn must be a strike in order to get that bonus uh in my uh Asad Dev series uh I I I talked to or ask a Pathfinder designer series a question similar to this came up and they said that whenever you see this text that says on the action before they're referring to your actions and it's not you're not splitting between rounds you're not splitting between players is intended like you spend your first action do to do a thing and then your second so that kind of by raw makes the jousting trait uh just not really functional uh so as as with my other recommendations I say you know do what makes sense and what makes fun uh and I would say as long as during the uh turn of the person being ridden during that turn if they move 10 ft at least uh then I would allow the character writing to make that strike and get the bonus I've actually not had this this situation come up in my own games yet but I I think I would probably give them the freedom to intermingle their three actions and use them however makes sense that can get fuzzy when you're getting to things like uh if they're suffering persistent damage when does that persistent damage kick in stuff like that but uh it that just seems to make more sense to me and be easier for the players to understand if you say uh okay you know player one that's being that's playing the Centaur you spend your first action stride okay now go ahead uh human on his back uh spin your ACT first action to make your strike just makes it easier my rules uh so I would allow that and also the question would you allow jousting to be um to be something that a character writing upon another player that is not a mount like a centaur would you allow that uh for me this is falling in that category of uh this sounds fun so why not uh if a halfling wants to have a a lance in one hand and holding the minotaur's horn and the other and the minur is going to make a charge attack against an enemy uh why not let the halfling you know thrust with their Lance and get their jousting benefit in doing so so uh get you know luring or or or just getting a plus one bonus to that damage making it 1 D6 plus one 186 damage it's not going to break the game and it sounds fun so let your players do stuff like that um okay so that's it for today's rule reminder about what are the rules for when a smaller size player wants to ride upon a larger size Ally uh in combat if you have any
