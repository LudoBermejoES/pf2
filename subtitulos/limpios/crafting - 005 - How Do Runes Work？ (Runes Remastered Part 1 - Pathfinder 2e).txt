hello and welcome to runes in Pathfinder second edition remastered part one in this video we're going to cover what runes are and how they work and in part two we'll examine other related topics like how to upgrade a rune how to remove a rune from its item or transfer a rune from one item to another as a reminder this video is for the remaster Edition so if your game is using the original Legacy edition of Pathfinder Edition please see the link in the description for a video that covers those rules most magic weapons armor and shields gain their special properties through runes runes represent ancient secrets in magical science that bestow power to the items that they're engraved upon and they take two forms fundamental runes and property runes fundamental runes provide the most basic and common magical effects for our weapons these runes increase attack bonus in damage for armor these runes provide a bonus to armor class and saves and for Shields these runes provide an increase to the shields hardness hit points and break threshold any weapon or armor can have one and only one of each kind of fundamental Rune the second type of runes are property runes these Grant many other effects beyond the basic enhancements provided by fundamental runes for example making a suit of armor resistant to acid damage or setting a long sours blade on fire let's take a closer look at fundamental runes first there are two kinds of fundamental runes for armor and those are armor potency runes and resilient runes armor potency runes Grant an item bonus to Armor class and the number of the bonus also indicates the maximum number of property runes that the item can have so a suit of Plus one leather armor means it is a suit of leather armor and gets a plus one item bonus to armor class in addition the potency Rune makes the armor magical and it will register dis spells like detect magic in rora the plus one potency Rune also means this leather armor may have one property Rune etched on it as well the second fundamental rune for armor is the resilient Rune resilient runes Grant a bonus to all saving throws in common three varieties resilient greater resilient and major resilient each of those runes increase the bonus of Saves by one so resilient runes are plus one to all saves greater resilient runes are plus two and major resilient runes are plus three remember when you see the name of a suit of armor the plus value in the name refers to its armor potency Rune and is also the bonus it receives to Armor class the plus number has nothing to do with the resilient Rune and its bonus to saves instead the armor will have the word resilient for plus one to saves the name will say greater resilient for a plus two to saves or major resilient for a plus three to all saves fundamental runes for weapons function in much the same way the First Fundamental rune for weapons is weapon potency when a potency rune is added to a weapon it is shown as a plus number in the weapon's name so a plus two battle axe has a plus two weapon potency Rune etched on it and that plus number is both the item bonus added to attack roles as well as the number of property runes the weapon can have and remember that plus value is only added to attack roles it does not Grant a bonus to damage instead to increase the weapon's damage you'll want to etch the second kind of weapon fundamental Rune which is called striking striking runes can increase the number of damage dice rolled with a weapon a striking Rune increases the weapon's damage to two dice a greater striking Rune increases base damage to three Dice and a major striking Rune increases base damage to four dice so if you add a striking Rune to a long sword it will deal 2 to8 damage on a hit instead of 1d8 and remember this is an increase to the weapon base damage dice so anytime the weapon dice are modified the extra damage from striking is also modified as well for example the twoand trait changes the weapon's base damage dice so a plus one striking Bastard Sword does 2 d8 damage when used with one hand and 2 D12 damage when used in both hands not 1 D12 plus 1d8 and the the damage due to striking is also increased if the effect specifically says it is for example the deadly trait states that its damage is increased if the weapon has a greater or major striking Rune therefore the number of deadly dice are increased but not if the weapon has just a regular striking Rune but striking runes do not increase the damage dice of damaging effects that are in addition to the base physical weapon damage for example Bon damage from a sneak attack would not be increased because of a striking Rune or fire damage caused by a flaming weapon that also would not be increased due to a striking Rune Shields only have one type of Rune which is called a reinforcing Rune reinforcing runes increase the shields hardness hit points and break threshold also note that reinforcing runes come in six types each with increasing bonuses and level requirements they are minor lesser moderate greater major and supreme as mentioned before there are two kinds of runes fundamental runes are the core runes that provide basic enhancements and the second type of runes are property runes simply put property runes let the armor or weapon do all kinds of other cool stuff beyond the basic things that come from fundamental runes want to give your sword the voral quality or where armor that can turn you invisible then you need to add property runes when you look at a property Rune step block you will see some effects are passive and always occur when the item is in use for example armor Ed with a shatter Rune grants its benefit whenever the armor is worn and invested but other runes like the shifting Rune require you to activate the item in this case it takes a single action to use the shifting Rune special properties there are way too many property runes to go over all of them here but it's pretty simple you would just treat those property runes in a very similar way as you would any other magical item the key difference being that runes cannot be used on their own they must be attached to another item it's also important to remember that there are limits to how many runes a single item can have etched on it each weapon or suit of armor can have one potency Rune in and either one resilient Rune if it's armor or one striking Rune if it is a weapon and then can have as many property runes as the bonus that's provided by its potency Rune so for example a plus one long sword has a plus one weapon potency Rune etched on it a plus one striking long sword has a plus one weapon potency Rune and a striking Rune and a plus one striking flaming long sword has a plus one weapon potency Rune a striking Rune and a flaming Rune this long sword cannot gain a second property Rune until it first increases its potency Rune to plus two and since the Striking Rune is a fundamental Rune it does not count against the number of property runes the sword can have and note that an item cannot have more than one of the same type of fundamental Rune so you couldn't have two plus one potency runes and instead dead would start with a single plus one potency Rune and then upgrade it to plus two but note that a weapon or armor can have multiple etchings of the same kind of property runes on them however the benefits do not stack if a weapon or armor has two or more of the same type of property Rune you only count whichever one provides the highest benefit that should give you a basic idea of how runes work in Pathfinder second edition remastered in the next video of this series we will expand this conversation by covering topics such as how to upgrade a rune how to remove a rune from an item and how to transfer a rune from one item to another and as always I'd like to take a quick moment to thank everybody who supports me in this channel whether that be by clicking the like
