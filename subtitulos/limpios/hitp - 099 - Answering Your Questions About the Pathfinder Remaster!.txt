[Music] hey everybody Dave here and today I've got a little bit of a sneak peek preview at the new and upcoming player core remaster and GM core remaster books for Pathfinder second edition if you've been following this channel for a while you've probably seen my previews before the way I usually do them is by sharing pages from the book by sharing the table of content by doing a broad overview of page counts and that sort of thing as well as giving a little bit of an overview of the highlights for these remaster books I'm going to do it a little bit different because the majority of the concept is going to be very familiar if you have the core rule book if you have the game mastery guide for Pathfinder second edition then you largely already know what is in the books and how they function and instead for this video what I thought I would do is solicit questions from the community about whatever aspects of these two new books are are most curious to them in providing answers to those questions and that's exactly what I did I I posted on both my patreon as well as to Reddit and a lot of folks out there were kind enough to offer their their questions and the things that their most interested in learning about the new books and I'm going to go over a number of those with you today now I do want to do a couple of disclaimers first of all I should let you know that I was provided copies of these books by piso and also I'm not going to be able to go over literally every one of the questions that was posed to me um some of them um were just not applicable for example there were a lot of questions that were specific to either the champion or monk classes and those surprisingly are not included in player Core 1 instead we will have to wait until player Core 2 to uh get the new writeups for those classes and also some of the questions that were asked were um things that frankly I'm going to have to do a lot of analysis to really formulate an opinion on um and some other items were were just simply things that I couldn't get a definite uh yes no answer when I look them up and so again I'm I might take a little more time to do a little more digging uh with the materials have been provided before answering those questions but don't worry there's still a lot for us to cover today so with that all in mind let's go ahead and jump into the first question that was asked and it's all about recall knowledge we we have heard that recall knowledge is going to change and now finally in player core one we we have the U the new Rite up for for recall knowledge essentially what the change is is they're adapting a common house rule that I already used in my games and I know a lot of other people did as well where instead of taking the original rules which said that you gave the most commonly um the most commonly known fact about an item or a monster that's being identified or something like that with recall knowledge um instead we are turning it now in the new system you your player is going ask you one specific question they're not going to say I want to do recall knowledge on this windigo they might say I'm going to do recall knowledge and I would like to know if the the Windy go is weak to fire so it's going to be one question they ask and then the gy is going to make a a secret um skill check for that person's um recall knowledge check and if it is a success then they're going to answer that question if it is a failure nothing happens if it's a critical failure the GM is going to give them a false bit of information and if it's a critical success then the GM's going to answer that question and either expound on it with more related adjacent information or might um might uh just allow them to ask a second question as well so in a nutshell that's how recall knowledge is working now uh no more do we have to worry about the mystery of figuring out what would be the most commonly known uh trait or aspect of whatever recall knowledge is being applied to and instead uh the onus is on the player to ask us a specific question that they want answered so the second question was all about uh states of awareness in Stealth have there been any uh meaningful material changes to those and from an overview and reading of those pieces in the player core I do not see any meaningful material changes um that are applied to any of the uh states of awareness or to stealth moving on is kind of a big one and I'm going to have to kind of divide it into a number of different parts and these are all about the new damage types so how to how do vitality and void work how do holy and Unholy damage work and how does Spirit damage work so first up vitality and void damage as far as I can tell they are pretty much just onetoone correspondence to the positive and negative damage types that we already had uh Vitality damage will only harm Undead and uh the opposite is true void damage will only harm the living um then holy and Unholy so holy and Unholy damage types and the holy and Unholy traits are largely replacing the mechanical side of alignments so if you haven't heard the big news in the Pathfinder second edition remaster alignments are a thing of the past and so there's still a mechanical need especially for divine characters to be able to apply some sort of additional effect when they're fighting um fiends and evil doers and so forth but we can't say evil doer anymore cuz evil is not a mechanical concept anymore so first thing you need to know is there is this thing called being Sanctified and sanctification when you are a uh when you choose to play a cleric and this is really in player core one the only area with this comes into effect we'll have to wait for player Core 2 to see how uh sanctification applies to uh Champions and potentially other other uh classes but um if you are a cleric you must choose a god you worship and that God is going to have some manner of sanctification listing in their little write up in the uh in the rule book and so that is either going to say if that the clerics that follow that God must be Sanctified as holy or must be Sanctified as Unholy or it could say that the cleric is required to choose one of those two or it may say that the cleric can choose one of those two if a cleric follows a God where the sanctification listing says that they can choose either holy or or Unholy that means that they can also choose none of the the above and not be Sanctified but uh in general uh good aligned so to speak uh deities are going to require their their followers uh or their clerics to be specific to be holy uh evil deities are probably going to ask that their um their clerics be Unholy and neutral in other French cases it could be you get to choose if you want to be holy or Unholy or you get to choose either of those or say none of the above but provided you are Sanctified then you gain the holy trait or you gain the Unholy trait now this also applies to uh casting spells and other damaging effects so holy affects anything with the Unholy trait so this is typically going to be fiends of every variety demons Devils so forth if it is a fiend it will probably have the Unholy trait and most Undead will also most likely have the Unholy trait so if you're dealing holy damage it's going to apply to uh most likely to fiends to undid but also to anything that has the Unholy trait which would include a cleric of a pre previously defined evil deity and the opposite of that is also going to be true uh Unholy damage is going to affect anything with the Holy trait which are typically going to be celestials like angels as well as any creatures with the Holy trait such as the cleric to a good aligned deity also there are a number of different spells and other effects that say if the target has either the holy or Unholy trait is going to do this extra effect as well now the third type of damage is Spirit damage so Spirit damage um as the name implies it uh damages the spirit of a creature so this is not inherently living or Undead um because a ghost is a spirit it most likely has a spirit and could be affected by Spirit damage but this damage is not affecting the physical body is affecting the soul so one example that the book points out is that if a creature is possessed by another being and you deal Spirit damage to them then it's not the physical possessed person who is hurt is going to be the person doing the possessing who is home harm because it's their Spirit who is in control of that possessed body and uh constructs are going to be immune to this kind of damage because they don't have Spirits typically so the next question that kind of is is building onto that is about holy and Unholy runes do we have magical runes for those new damage types and yes we do holy runes deal an extra 1 D4 Spirit damage to a weapon attack that has a holy Rune or 2 D4 against enemies with the Unholy trait also once per day after critically succeeding on a strike against an Unholy Target the wheeler can spend their reaction to heal themselves double the target's level Unholy creatures are going to be infeed too whenever carrying or wielding a weapon that has a holy r Rune etched upon it and Unholy runes are going to function pretty much exactly the same way except they don't heal on those Critical Hits once per day instead they're going to apply bleed damage once per day to a holy Target that they critically succeed their strikes against so next question is there a way to get the holy and Unholy traits other than being a clarc I did not see any other ways in the uh player core book uh to apply sanctification and gain the holy and Unholy traits um outside of being a cleric by class or taking the cleric multiclass uh dedication feat which requires you to undergo sanctification in the exact same way as as a regular cleric um you still have to choose a God and apply either holy or Unholy or none of the above if you get that option uh I was a little surprised by that I was expecting there to be some other some other method within the the game to gain those um those traits uh for example the Nephilim which is sort of the catch all ancestry for Outsiders or people who have an outsider Heritage in their bloodline so teelings and ASMR and so on and so forth in the new book are all gathered together Under The Heading of Nephilim and um even though it writes about like you know uh uh if you have an infernal ancestry or what would used to have been called a teeling uh people look at you and see horns and hoofs and they might assume you have the Unholy trait but I didn't see anything in that write up that gave a path to earning either the holy or Unholy trait all right so moving on I got a question about uh Consecration and the consecrate ritual so the consecration trait is unchanged as far as I can tell from uh the Legacy Pathfinder Second Edition rules but the consecrate ritual has been adjusted to account for Holy and Unholy traits and it now has a a part of it that reads as follows if your deity's Divine sanctification allows you to choose holy or Unholy you can choose to make the consecrated site holy or Unholy as well if the deities sanctification must be holy or Unholy you must make the site match that sanctification and it adds strikes made by worshippers of your deity within the area gain the sight's sanctification trait if any so if you perform the consecrate ritual and uh you are following a holy God and you have been Sanctified as being holy then that uh area of the consecration is going to have the Holy trait applied to that area and any followers of your God in that area or regardless if they're clerics or not or if they have uh the holy trait or not all those followers within that area they follow your God will have the Holy trait applied to their strikes and their attack against enemies within that area so uh next question is about Focus points and the focus pool are Focus pools still capped at three yes there is still a hard cap of a maximum of three Focus points but you can use the refocus activity every 10 minutes without limitation so in the original Pathfinder Second Edition rules you could refocus for 10 minutes but you could only do that if you had spent at least one Focus Point since the last time you uh refocused and so that would prevent someone from taking 30 minute taking a 30- minute break after a fight and getting all three of their points back and having them all available for the next fight that rule was uh more than a little confusing to to a number of people so they've simplified it in the remaster Edition and uh now that language is removed from refocus it no longer has that limitation so now if you do have 30 minutes you can spend uh all 30 minutes and refocus three times in a row and get all three of your focus points back but uh three points is still the listed maximum for Focus points uh the next couple questions are all dealing with the layout of the book um is it more user friendly is it easier to navigate gate around does it look nice uh so first of all yeah I think it looks very nice second of all um it is a little easier to navigate around but I don't think the changes are are so uh material and wide sweeping that I would go so far as to say that it's fundamentally an easier layout and book for for new players if you want a layout that's going to be friendly for new people then perhaps the beginner box is still the place to to look for that but some of the things that they've done uh with the layout and presentation of the remaster books first of all they are using green as a dominant color so it's easy to recognize what is uh a remaster book versus one of the original Legacy Rule books they are also applying some more use of bold there are some sidebars in the new book that have bolded words to Stand Out whereas in the original version those same sidebars did not and uh the index has been improved uh in my point of view because for example the player core one not only includes all the index items that you would expect to find in a player core rule book but if there was something that was included in the core rule book in the original release that has now been moved to GM core then the player core book has an index entry for those items and it says hey that's not in this book anymore you're going to want to go check out the GM core and it will give you the page number to the GM core which is super handy a good example of this is runes runes are no longer found in the player book runes are now listed solely in the GM book but because players might be looking for that information the index in the player core book does direct them to the appropriate page in the GM core rules which I think was um a great addition and well thought out next question is about Shield runes we heard that there were changes coming to Shields um but what about Shield runes how are these going to function okay so Shields now have their own potency runes that are called reinfor forcing runes reinforcing runes increase the hardness the hit points and the break threshold all three of them for any Shield that is Eed with a reinforcing Rune unlike potency runes for uh for weapons and for armor Shield potency runes these reinforcing runes come in six varieties instead of three the first it becomes available at fourth level and then a new one every three levels after so the six types of reinforcing runes are minor lesser moderate greater major and supreme now those are the um potency runes for Shields however at this time I don't believe there are any potency runes for Shields I didn't see any of those listed uh that could be something that they plan to add later I don't know but for example there's no like flaming shield runes and and so forth there are still plenty of just standard magical Shields that apply different different aspects similar to what we would achieve through potency runes or through U through property runes excuse me um but as of right now in this first release No property runes for Shields only potency runes they are called reinforcing runes they increase hardness hit points and break threshold so next question was uh are there any changes to crafting and yes and um there are changes that I am pretty excited about that I like um these changes are going to alleviate some of the most common um concerns about crafting but if there's one thing I've learned running this channel is that there's a lot of people out there who just fundamentally hate the crafting rules in Pathfinder second addition for those folks this may not uh may not fix all year problems but here's what they've done to crafting first of all they have reduced the base time to craft from 4 days to only two days so now you have to it still works the same way you still have to have half of the value of the item you want to craft and raw materials you spend two days instead of four days uh setting up and beginning work and uh exhaust those uh that value that half value of uh the price of the item you're crafting and then make a skill check and then after that you can choose to either pay the remaining cost out of your pocket and finish immediately or continue working additional days and for every additional day spent crafting you reduce the uh the remaining budget by the amount found on the earn income table that process is is all the same the difference is instead of having to work four days before you can finish you only have to work two also another big thing that changed is if what you are crafting is common Rarity then you do not need a formula for it so you no longer have to have a formula to craft something if it is common Rarity now if you want to craft something that is not common Rarity then you either must have the formula for that item or you must have an already crafted uh sample of that item if I want to uh craft a magic weapon and that magic weapon is uncommon Rarity I either need a formula for that weapon or I need to have that weapon in front of me for me to examine and figure out and basically replicate now here's the thing though you no longer have to have a formula for common Rarity and you don't have to have a formula for uncommon and more rare as long as you have a sample to work off of but if you do have the formula for what you're trying to craft then the amount of time needed to to craft it is further reduced from two days to only one day so if you were to apply this logic to the original crafting rules and you have the formula for whatever you're trying to craft then it goes from being a minimum four days to a minimum one day of work uh so I think that's going to make a lot of people happy out there even if it doesn't fix all of the concerns that exist uh with crafting moving on the next question is about disarm did they fix disarm rules um and I can't objectively say if it is fixed or not but they did improveed this did get a buff and what they've done is they've removed the limitation that's listed in the write up for disarm that says until the start of that creature's turn so in the original disarm rules if you succeeded but not critically succeeded on a uh disarm attempt then you JW the item loose in your opponent's hand and that gives you a plus two to Future attempts to knock it out which would require a critical success and it imposes a negative -2 penalty to that person uh wanting to use it but in the original rules those penalties immediately went away at the start of that creature's next turn which basically meant imposing the2 to their attacks with the weapon you're trying to disarm completely useless except if maybe they were going to uh get an opportunity attack um uh which is no longer called an attack of opportunity in this system uh but uh I'm sure you get the idea that's very limited use the new version of his arm just removes that language and instead the penalty that's app applied to using an item that has been knocked Loose by a disarm attempt persists until that person spins an action to to interact with the weapon or whatever you're trying to remove from their grasp and fix their grip so uh that so when it comes to that that character that enemy's turn they're going to have to make the decision do I want to attack with this and suffer a negative -2 to the attack or do I want to sacrifice one of my three actions to regrip the weapon properly um and remove those penalties so probably is not the uh the fix solution that some people want it's not going back to the housian days of Pathfinder first edition but this is definitely a buff to disarm attempts so next up we have the Ruffian Rogue and the Ruffian Rogue is something that uh they had hinted that there were changes coming for so now they're here so let's talk about them this is going to deal with what weapons a Ruffian Rogue can use to make sneake attacks in the original Legacy first release of Pathfinder second edition uh that was limited to simple weapons they could use Simple weapons to make their sneak attacks and that's been changed uh and it now reads as the following you can deal sneak attack damage with any weapon not just the weapons listed in the sneak attack class feature this benefit does not apply to a simple weapon with a damage die greater than d8 or a marshall or Advanced weapon with a damage die greater than D6 apply any abilities that alter the damage die first critical hits you make with these weapons gain the weapon critical specialization benefit if the target is off guard to you um offu by the way is the new term for flat footed so uh this was great they're they're uh greatly expanding the weapons that a Ruffian Rogue can use to make snake attacks with however there is a damag die cap again for simple weapons that cap is d8 and for Marshall or Advanced weapons that cap is at D6 so next is uh a question that um by now if you're on Reddit or following uh a number of my peers in the world of YouTube you've probably heard an awful lot about and that is wounded and dying did they clarify exactly when the wounded value is added to your your dying condition value and this goes back to inconsistencies in the original text and also the beginnner bunks had areas where they they said that uh the wounded condition only applies to your or only increases your dying value at the moment you become unconscious and there's other places that say that you add the wounded's value to your dying value every single time you either fail a recovery check while you're unconscious with the dying condition or whenever you suffer additional damage while you have the dying condition the good news is this has been clarified uh the bad news is that I I absolutely cannot fathom why they decided to go this way uh but for whatever is worth the new official rules clearly specify that for Recovery checks the dying condition increases by one plus your wounded value on a failure or two plus the wounded value on a critical failure and also your wounded value is added to your dying value every time you suffer additional damage while you have the dying condition so if you are wounded one and get knocked down into zero hit points you immediately go to dying two if you fail your first recovery check that is going to increase by one for the failure and go from two to three but you're also going to apply your wounded condition value again taking U24 and um Pathfinder second edition has been the most most lethal D20 based RPG I've ever run I have had more player deaths in this system than any others so making it more deadly more dangerous more difficult to play I have no clue why piso decided to go this way um if you if if your goal is to to uh scare away new players this is an excellent way to do that this is a great way to make sure people do not adopt and play your game uh so that said uh my house rule number one is I'm not doing that I'm only applying the wounded value to the dying condition when a person gains the dying condition and not after every single failed recovery Checker when they suffer additional damage uh the game is simply just lethal enough the way it is and if I'm introducing new players to my game uh I want to be a little more lenient with them making mistakes um and again I I am baffled frankly baffled by their decision to go this way but that's what the the new rule is and our next question is about the warrior Muse bard uh this question says that they mentioned that they were doing something to make it feel better but we haven't heard anything since okay so uh the warrior Muse Bard I did a a cursory look at it and I believe the changes are have been applied to the Marshall performance feat which all Warrior Muse bars receive the old version said you become trained with all Marshall weapons if you gain the B weapon expertise class feature your proficiency rank with Marshall weapons increases to expert now the new version of Marshall performance for the warrior Muse BS has been completely Rewritten and it now says when you have a courageous Anthem composition canri active Al so it's worth mentioning that courageous Anthem is the new name for inspire courage so this is sort of like saying in the old version whenever you have Inspire courage active but now it's called courageous Anthem so when you have that cantrip active and you damage an enemy with a strike the Spell's duration is extended by one round you can extend an individual casting only once this way so I believe what they're basically saying here is as long as you can reliably strike and deal damage to your enemies then you will only need to spend one action to cast a courageous Anthem or Inspire courage once every two rounds instead of having to spend an action on it every single round but again you have to be able to successfully strike and deal damage to an enemy in order to get that benefit uh it goes on to say if you gain the rallying Anthem or song of strength composition cantrips you can apply this benefit to those cantrips as well and uh this is another time where the U the names have changed a little bit rallying Anthem is what used to be known as Inspire defense it's now called rallying Anthem but um if you are a warrior Muse bar then you get that same benefit for courageous anthem for rallying Anthem and for song of strength as if you have one of those cast and it's active and you strike and deal damage to an enemy then it extends the duration of that casting by one round but you can only do that one time per casting so again I believe the benefit here is that uh as long as you can reliably hit and deal damage you will only sacrifice one action every two turns on those can trips instead of once every single turn all right so those were a handful of questions that were asked on Reddit and on patreon and uh if you have any questions about them please feel free to leave those in the comments if you have any questions that uh were not touched on in this video I do plan to do more videos about this please leave those in the comments as well and as always I want to take a quick moment to say thank you to everybody out there who supports me whether that's by leaving those questions and comments and suggestions or clicking the like button subscribing to this Channel or subscribing to the patreon I really appreciate everything you folks do to support me and with that thanks for watching take care and happy
