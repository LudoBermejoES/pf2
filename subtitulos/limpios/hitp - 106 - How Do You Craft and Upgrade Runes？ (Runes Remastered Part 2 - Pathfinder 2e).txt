hello and welcome to runes for Pathfinder second edition remastered part two in the previous video we discussed the foundation for runes and Pathfinder primarily the relationship between fundamental runes and property runes and in this video we're going to expand on that by covering a few of the other additional rules including how to etch or create a magic rune how to upgrade runes and how to transfer runes from one item to another this video does does rely heavily on the crafting rules so if you've not already viewed my videos on Crafting it's highly recommended that you do so before continuing here links to these videos are provided in the description the term etching a rune is just a formal way of saying creating a rune and adding it to an item this follows the same system as crafting anything else the only real difference is you're not making an entirely new item you're just adding to an already existing item if you want to etch a plus one weapon potency Rune on a long sword you would first need to be at least expert Proficiency in the crafting skill and have the magical crafting feat you also need the long sword you plan to etch the Rune on and you need to either have the formula for weapon potency runes or you need to have another item with that Rune on it already that you can copy and you would need to have at least half the rune's price available in raw materials in this case that would be half half of 35 gold which is 17 gold and five silver from there assuming you have the formula you spend one day of work as usual with crafting and after that you will make a skill check and if that's successful you can pay the balance to finish the project or invest more time in lowering the balance again check out my videos about crafting for more detail on how all of that works some runes typically fundamental runes allow you to upgrade low lower level versions into higher level versions if a rune is eligible to be upgraded it will say so in its description here the description for the armor potency Rune spells it all out for you the process is simple it works just like etching a rune except the price is discounted by the price of the existing Rune that is being replaced so if you want to upgrade a suit of plus one chain mail to plus two chain mail you would treat it the same as crafting a plus two armor potency Rune from scratch you need to have either the formula for armor potency runes or have another item with the armor potency Rune on it that you're going to copy you must be at least 11th level and have Master Proficiency in crafting you need the magical crafting feat and you must provide 50% of the run's price up front in raw materials the difference with upgrading though is the normal price for this Rune is 1,60 gold but when upgrading you discount it by the original runes price P of 160 gold making the upgrade price 900 gold pieces you pay 50% of that up front or 450 gold spend one day of downtime working assuming you're using the formula and then make a crafting skill check as usual then assuming you succeed the check you can either pay off the remaining balance of 450 gold or spend more days of downtime lowering that balance further note that the table on page 224 of the GM or rule book outlines a typical progression for upgrading armor and weapons and follows the pattern of upgrading the potency Rune then the resilient rune for armor or striking rune for weapons then upgrading the potency Rune again and repeating this is a typical progression but it is not absolutely required for example you can upgrade the Striking Rune of a weapon before upgrading its potency Rune you can even have a striking Rune on a weapon that has no potency Rune but given the availability of these runes and the way their prices are staggered it makes most sense to follow the progression that's provided in these charts you can also use the crafting skill to move a rune from one item to another or swamp a rune on one item with a rune that's on another item doing so takes one day of downtime and costs 10% of the runes price if you're swapping runes between two items then you only use the price of the highest level Rune to determine the cost you don't have to pay 10% of the price of each of the runes being swapped only the higher level one also you don't need a formula to transfer a rune but otherwise this is identical to crafting or etching a rune you must have the magical crafting feat and pay half the cost which is 5% of the run's price up front then make your crafting check and if that's successful you can choose to pay the other half or continue working as normal with crafting ing there are a couple of other rules that you might want to be aware of first if swapping runes they must both be fundamental runes or both must be property runes and the final item or items must be legal for example you can't transfer a wounding rune from a dagger onto a mace because this Rune requires it to be attached to a slashing or piercing weapon and maces are boning weapons one tweak to be aware of is when transferring potent runes it's possible you might end up with an item that has property runes on it that can no longer function because they require a potency Rune that is no longer present this doesn't prevent you from transferring the potency Rune but affected property runes go dormant until they're either transferred to an item that does have the necessary potency Rune or until you etge the appropriate potency Rune onto the item that is bearing those dormant runes at which time they reactivate and can function again I also want to mention run Stones runestones cost three gold pieces each and they essentially provide a way of transporting a rune without requiring it to be etched onto a weapon Shield or suit of armor these are provided so that GMS can distribute runes to players so that those players can decide how best to use the runes rather than giving them runes already etched onto equipment they may not want to use or may not even be able to use R Stones work like any other item for the purposes of crafting or transferring a rune you can etch a rune onto a runstone or you can transfer a rune off of an item and onto a run Stone the big difference is that runestones are consumed and destroyed as soon as its Rune is removed off of them and transferred to another item and that transfer has no cost associated with it under normal circumstances when you transfer a rune off an item you have to pay 10% of its price but if that item is a run Stone there is no cost associated with transferring that Rune from that runestone and onto another item so that's it for the fundamentals of runes for those of you who would like a summary of what has changed with the remaster Edition the key mechanical differences lie with the crafting rules the minimum time required to craft or upgrade a rune has decreased from 4 days to 1 day and it is now possible to craft an item without having its formula as long as you have a sample of that item and are making a copy of it however having the formula allows you to craft the item faster in addition to that there are several other points that have been clarified since the original release of second edition those are you do not have to upgrade potency before other fundamental runes like resilient and striking you don't have to upgrade runes step by step for example you can upgrade a plus one weapon potency Rune directly to a plus three Rune and and you do not need a formula to transfer a rune but you do need to have the magical crafting feat to transfer runes if you have any questions please leave them in the comments below and as always I'd like to take a brief moment to thank everyone who
