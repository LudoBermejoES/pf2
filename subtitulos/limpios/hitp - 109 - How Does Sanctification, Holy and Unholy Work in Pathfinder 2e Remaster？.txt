[Music] hello and welcome to sanctification in Pathfinder second edition remastered by how it's played sanctification is a new system added to the game as part of the remaster project and does not apply if your group is using the Pathfinder second edition Legacy rules simply put the original release of second edition used The Familiar alignment system found in most D20 fantasy RPGs but alignment was removed as part of the remaster and sanctification takes its place some deities but certainly not all participate in the ongoing holy war between celestials and fiends and use their divine power to imbue their followers with abilities that potentially make them more deadly to members of the other side of the conflict but also possibly more vulnerable this process is called sanctification it applies either the holy or Unholy trait to the sponsored character and only those who have a mechanical feature that specifically calls for them to become Sanctified may be Sanctified this will most likely be through the deity class feature that belongs to both the champion and cleric classes members of these classes must choose a deity that they worship and selecting that deity informs the player of their sanctification options for example the stats for iom say Divine sanctification must choose holy meaning all characters Sanctified by iom must be holy and have the Holy trait and if we look at eroa it says Divine sanctification must choose Unholy meaning all characters Sanctified by eroa will have the Unholy trait those are two examples that have strict sanctification requirements but but many deities allow their devotees some flexibility for example the block for desna says Divine sanctification can choose holy meaning those characters who have a class feature that grants sanctification and follow desna get a choice they can either choose to be Sanctified holy and therefore have the Holy trait or they can choose not to be Sanctified at all but they cannot choose to be Sanctified Unholy should they choose not to be Sanctified at all then they will have neither the holy nor Unholy traits and abidar entry says Divine sanctification can choose holy or Unholy so his clerics can choose to gain the holy trait the Unholy trait or can choose not to be Sanctified and received neither and one last example is Goa whose entry says Divine sanctification none and never sanctifies their clerics the key to Remember When choosing sanctification is if your deity's entry has the word can in it then you have the option of choosing either what is listed or you can choose not to be Sanctified at all and therefore not have either the holy or Unholy trait but if your DD's entry says must then you have to be Sanctified according to the listing and cannot choose to not be Sanctified and remember that a character must have a feature that grants sanctification in order to be holy or Unholy for example a sorcerer who worships ium and cast spells from the Divine tradition is not Sanctified and does not have the Holy trait at least not by default this sorcerer could gain sanctification by taking a feature that mechanically provides sanctification such as multiclassing with cleric but once a character cleric Champion or otherwise gains such a mechanical feature they must choose a deity to follow in each deity stat block describes what sanctification options are available to their worshippers so what does it mean to be Sanctified and gain the holy or Unholy trait in and of themselves these traits do very little but what matters is how they interact with other mechanics and effects First Holy and Unholy are frequently used as prerequisites to gain access to something for example the Eternal blessing feat can only be selected by a character who has the holy trait second all Sanctified actions you perform gain your sanctification trait for example the Divine Lance spell has the Sanctified trait making it a Sanctified spell what this means is that it is neither inherently holy nor Unholy but if the person casting it has the holy or Unholy trait then the divine l Spell gains that corresponding trait meaning it will trigger weaknesses of that same type only spells with the Sanctified trait gain your holy or Unholy trait not all spells or similar effects meaning when a cleric of saren Ray who is Sanctified as holy casts Divine Lance it gains the holy trait and triggers any weaknesses to Holy the target has but if that same cleric casts Fireball that will not become a holy Fireball and Trigger those weaknesses because Fireball does not have the holy or Sanctified traits and the same is true when casting the heel spell heel does not have the holy or Sanctified traits therefore the damage it deals to Undead does not trigger weaknesses to Holy nor does it harm living creatures that are weak to Holy however there is a feat clerics can take at first level called Divine castigation that grants heal the holy trait and allows it to damage anyone with the Unholy trait this is Spirit damage and it would apply to any creature with the Unholy trait and if that creature is also weak to Holy it would trigger that weakness as well let's look at a more specific example Kirra is a cleric of sarra and is Sanctified as holy therefore she has the holy trck she attacks a goblin warrior with Divine Lance because Divine Lance has the Sanctified trait it adopts her holy trait making it a holy Divine Lance so to speak if she hits the goblin with her holy Divine Lance it will suffer 2 D4 Spirit damage just like most anything else the goblin is not weak to Holy and there is nothing else here that interacts with the Holy trait so Kyra being holy makes no difference in this example her Divine Lance functions the same as any other Divine casters when attacking this Goblin next let's consider what happens when Kyra casts Divine Lance at a bar guest we see here that bargus have the Unholy trait and weakness five to Holy therefore if Kyra hits it with her Divine Lance she will trigger its weakness and deal an extra five damage for a total of 2 D4 + 5 Spirit damage and now let's look at what happens when Kyra casts Divine Lance at a grave Knight we can see here that grave Knights do have the Unholy trait so what happens when Kyra hits it with one of her holy Divine lances well nothing special it simply deals its normal 2 D4 Spirit damage why because there is nothing in the Great Knight stat block that interacts with holy effects simply being Unholy isn't enough the creature needs to have a weakness to Holy which grave Knights do not have or they need some other mechanic that specifically mentions how it interacts with holy effects but what if Kyra had cast Holy Light at the grave Knight here it specifically says that if the target has the Unholy trait It suffers an additional 5d6 Spirit damage and Grave Knights do have the Unholy trait so in this case they would suffer 5d6 fire damage plus an additional 5d6 spirit damage so to sum up Simply Having the Holy or Unholy trait does not make you weak to the opposite effects you must specifically have a weakness to Holy or Unholy likewise Having the Holy trait does not make you automat atically suffer additional damage from Unholy sources all of an Unholy Champion strikes have the Unholy trait but they won't do any extra damage to Kyra because she does not specifically have a weakness to Unholy the holy and Unholy traits also modify how certain items can be used if a creature who is weak to Holy or Unholy attempts to use an item with that trait they suffer an amount of damage equal to their weakness for example there is nothing that prevents a devil that has weakness five to Holy from picking up and using a defeated enemy's holy long sword but if they do they will suffer Five Points of damage every time they attack with it they will also be in feeble to per the text of the Holy Rune while carrying it assuming they have the Unholy trait in addition to being weak to Holy and similar to using Sanctified weapons we should also discuss who can cast Sanctified spells and the short answer is anyone who can cast spells of that tradition can cast the spell you can cast a spell that has the holy trait even if you are not holy and even if you are Unholy and vice versa a person who is Sanctified as holy can cast spells that have the Unholy trait but there is one major problem if they do casting such a spell might be an anema to their religion behaviors that are anathema are against your personal code or an institution you are bound to like a religion to deities these acts are heresy and indirect violation of their beliefs to gain some insight into what a deity labels as anathema check out their writeup for example in the Church of abdar it is forbidden to engage in banditry or piracy to steal or undermine a law of abiding Court into eroa it is anathema to deny your appetites destroy Undead or to sacrifice your life committing such acts have serious consequences the exact punishments of committing acts that are anathema to your faith are largely up to the GM to determine but some guidance is provided in the deity class feature for clerics and champions here it says if you perform enough acts that are anema to your deity you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity and these abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual the book also says casting spells with the Unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow Unholy sanctification and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification casting spells that are anathema to the tenants or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity for example casting a spell to create Undead would be anatha to fasma the goddess of death so can you cast Unholy spells if you are Sanctified holy yes but you run the risk of being punished by your deity exactly when that happens into what extent is LIF up to your GM to decide but it'd probably be wise not to even test those Waters so what has changed with the remaster well basically everything with the elimination of the alignment system everything in this video is New Territory so instead of listing the differences here as I usually do I'm instead going to go over a few points to remember about conversions if you are running a remaster Edition game and want to use content from the Legacy Edition there are a couple of things worth noting first alignment damage is no longer supported instead wherever in the Legacy Edition you see effects that deal good damage or evil damage you should instead change that to Spirit damage also resistances and weaknesses to alignment damage should be updated if a legacy monster has resistance or weakness to good damage change that to Holy and if they have a resistance or weakness to evil damage change that to Unholy it would probably be reasonable to also give them the appropriate sanctification trait as well so there you have it sanctification and Pathfinder second edition remastered
