hello and welcome to Shields and Pathfinder second edition remastered Shields and Pathfinder function a little different than what you may be used to from other D20 Fantasy games as you might expect Pathfinder Shields require an arm to use and Grant a circumstance bonus to Armor class but what's different are a couple tweaks to the old Formula First Shields do not always grant their bonus to Armor class instead a character must use the raise a shield action to gain that benefit this costs one action and grants The Shield's circumstance bonus to armor class until the start of their next turn if you want to keep this bonus going longer then you need to keep spending one of your actions every turn and note that this is a general action so it is available to everyone there is no Shield proficiency requirement anyone can pick up a shield and use the raise a shield action to gain its bonus to Armor class the second point we need to discuss is The Shield block feat this feat is provided automatically to several Marshall classes such as Champions Druids exemplars and Fighters War priest clerics also gain this feat for free but not other clerics and as a general feat anyone of any class can pick up Shield block as one of their General feat selections and I would would recommend anyone who plans to make using a shield a regular part of their game play to do so if you're willing to invest in action every round to use your Shield you might as well get the most benefit out of doing so what this feat does is it allows you to spend your reaction each round to mitigate the damage received from a successful enemy attack this can only be done while you have a shield raised so you would spend one action on your turn to raise the shield and then later in the round during during an enemy's turn if they hit you with an attack that deals physical damage you can spend your reaction that round to block it so since this costs a reaction you typically will only be able to block one attack per round with your Shield but there is an exception to this that we will talk about a little bit later and remember that blocking an attack with your Shield does not mean that you suffer no damage it just reduces the amount of damage you receive each Shield has a listed hardness rating as well as hit points and break threshold abbreviated as BT hardness is damage reduction when you block an enemy's attack with your Shield you calculate their damage as normal and then subtract The Shield's hardness value from that and if there is any remaining damage after hardness is removed that amount of damage is applied to both you and your Shield remember this excess damage is not divided between you and the shield it is applied equally to both you and the shield for example let's say valorous the fighter is battling a goblin on his turn valeros spins one action to raise his wooden Shield doing so increases his armor class by two then on the Goblin's turn it makes an attack roll and scores a hit even with Valero's buffed up Armor class the goblin rolls damage and gets a total of five is's player now decides to spend their reaction on Shield block and this is important to remember you do not have to declare that you are using Shield block until after the damage has been rolled wooden Shields have a hardness value of three so we would subtract that from the damage of five leaving two points of damage that would be applied to both valeros and his shield so valeros loses two hit points and his wooden Shield is reduced from 12 hit points to 10 if the goblin spent its second action to attack again valerus would still have the plus two bonus to armor class but would not be able to use Shield block again because doing so Conant reaction and he has no more reactions to spend this round we've discussed how Shields can be used to mitigate or absorb damage with the shield block feet so now let's look at what happens when your Shield takes too much damage and runs out of hit points as previously mentioned each Shield is listed on the table with a break threshold when a shield or really any object has its hit points lowered to this threshold number it becomes broken broken items no longer function as they are meant to which means a broken shield no longer grants a bonus to Armor class and in fact cannot even be used with raise a shield nor can it be used to block further damage it's worth noting that the entry for the broken condition does contain exceptions to this for broken armor but mechanically speaking a shield is not armor and therefore does not interact with this exception when a Shield's hit points are equal to or lower than his broken threshold it effectively ceases to be a shield and if a shield or or any item has its hit points reduced all the way to zero is destroyed so if a shield is destroyed at zero hit points and a broken shield can't be used anyway then why even have a broken condition wouldn't it make more sense just to say The Shield is destroyed at its broken threshold says it can't be used anymore well the reason for this distinction between broken and destroyed is a broken shield can still be repaired and used again whereas a destroyed Shield is beyond the point of repair unsurprisingly to repair a shield you use the repair applic ation of the crafting skill you do not need to be trained in the crafting skill to attempt a repair but it definitely helps to use repair you'll need a repair toolkit and spend 10 minutes of work hammering out dents and mending tears at the end of this time you'll roll a crafting skill check versus a DC set by the GM this is usually a level based DC per the table on page 53 of the GM core rule book based on The Shield's level not the players on a sus The Shield regains a number of hit points equal to five plus five more for each level of proficiency so if you're not trained at all in crafting you restore five hit points if you have trained proficiency you restore 10 hit points and so on if this raises The Shield's hit points higher than his break threshold it loses the broken condition and once more functions like a normal shield on a critical success you restore double the usual amount on a normal failure nothing happens you spend 10 minutes but you don't gain any ground and must spend another 10 minutes and try again and on a critical failure you mess up so bad that you deal 2d6 damage to the shield fortunately The Shield's usual hardness value reduces this damage as normal but if this damage reduces The Shield to zero hit points it is destroyed and cannot be repaired again there are four basic types of shields each with their own features these are bucklers wooden Shields steel Shields and Tower Shields wooden and steel Shields function as we've already covered the key difference being steel Shields are sturdier and have higher hardness scores and more hit points bucklers are lighter Shields that are strapped to the arm but do not require a hand to use instead said the hand that would normally hold a larger Shield can be used to hold any light object that is not a weapon so a person using a buckler could still use that arm to drink a potion to use athletic actions like grab and shove or take other interact actions that don't involve weapons and they would still be able to use the raise of Shield action Tower Shields are very large in function as portable cover carrying one imposes a negative 5 penalty to speed but the wielder may use the tower shield with the take cover action while their Shield is raised to increase their circumstance bonus Armor class from plus two to plus 4 essentially this allows you to use take cover even when you're in an open field with no other viable sources of cover nearby those are the standard shield types but it is worth noting that there are also magical Shields with unique properties as well as runes that can be Ed onto Shields to enhance them in the same way that runes can enhance armor and weapons there's currently only one Rune that can be placed on Shields and that's the reinforcing Rune these runes increase the hardness hit points and break threshold of any Shield they're edged onto up to a specified maximum Shields can also be made from precious materials for example making a shield out of adamantine increases the base stance of that shield and a can then be further enhanced by a reinforcing Rune as long as doing so doesn't increase its hardness in hit points past the maximum limits specified by the Rune and other Shields forged from precious materials like cold iron and silver are treated as Weapons of that material when the shields are used to bash an enemy so let's take a moment to go over Shield bashing when making a shield bash attack The Shield is treated as a marshall melee weapon per the weapons table on page 278 of player Core 1 it deals one4 bling damage and belongs to the shield group meaning if you have access to the critical specialization effect for Shields you can push your target back 5T after scoring a critical hit with a shield bash and this damage can be further increased to D6 by attaching a shield boss and changed to piercing damage with Shield spikes and unlike the shield itself Shield bosses and shield spikes can be enhanced with weapon runes Shields can also be enhanced by attaching a shield augmentation you can't use a shield augmentation if you already have a shield boss or Shield spikes attached but if you choose to add an augmentation over one of those it allows you to add special traits to the shield you can choose to add one trait being either back swing or forceful or or you can choose two of the following disarm non-lethal shove thrown 10 ft trip or versatile slashing so this can give you a few more options for how to use your Shield but if you really want to cosplay Captain America with it you might want to invest in the throwing Shield adjustment that increases its range to 20 ft is damaged to a D6 and allows you to remove the shield so it can be thrown with a free action however this augmentation also makes the shield lighter which reduces its hardness rating by one next let's talk about Shield Feats I'm not going to go over all of them but a few of note include reactive Shield which lets you spend your reaction to raise your Shield instead of an action reflexive Shield lets you use Shield block against attacks that call for a reflex save including those that don't deal physical damage like a fireball spell quick Shield block grants an extra action each turn that can only be used for shield blocks this allows you to make two Shield blocks each turn or make a shield Block in the same round as you use reactive shield and ever stand stance and ever stand strike require you to be a knight of last wall to gain access but the stance increases the damage die of The Shield by one step when using it as a weapon and also increases its hardness by two when using the shield block provided you are wielding the shield with both of your hands and ever stand a strike allows you to automatically raise your Shield after a successful Shield strike so
