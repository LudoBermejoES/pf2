[Music] hey everybody Dave here with another Pathfinder rule REM reminder for you and today we're going to be talking about crafting tattoos I recently put out a video a a second part of a series this is looking at the remastered crafting rules and that second video was all about crafting magic items but one specific type of magic item that was missing from that video and that folks the comments uh pointed out was crafting magical tattoos so I just wanted to make a a another video to very briefly go over what those rules are now before I get into this I should say that uh the reason why uh magical tattoos were not included in that previous video even though they are a type of magical item is because the new remaster books make no mention of tattoos in them and I was following those books so what I'm sharing today is the version of of the tattoo crafting rules as they exist in the Legacy Edition and we can all pretty much assume at least for now that this is the way that they work uh in the remaster version as well unless at some point they do go back and make a specific change to to state otherwise so magical tattoos are again they're type of type of magic item they are are mechanically speaking magic items but they have the tattoo TR trait and that tattoo trait does handle things a little differently than some other magic items you can basically think of them as uh worn magic items that are just impossible or extremely difficult to uh to remove or disarm from you they're like permanent worn items and as such they do need to be invested however the mechanism for investing them is a little different um mechanically speaking what they do is they look lower the maximum number of items you can invest by one and that distinction is important because the user then does not choose whether or not they want to invest a tattoo or basically turn them on or off once the tattooing is complete the tattoo has been crafted on a person they are active and they lower the amount of items you can invest by one as opposed to Counting as uh their own regular invested items but other than that they're going to function very similar to other magic items but crafting is different so the crafting rules for Magical tattoos can be found on page 164 of the secrets of magic book and there you'll find a section that reads as follows to craft a magical tattoo you must be able to craft magic items and have a specialty in tattooing you can attain these requirements by taking the tattoo artist skill feet below or you can take both the magical crafting and Specialty crafting skill Feats choosing Artistry as your specialty so even though tattoos are magic items they don't fall under the general umbrella of other magic items where you only need the magical crafting feed in order to craft tattoos you need either the magical crafting feat and the specialty feat where you specialize in Artistry or you can take only the tattoo artist feet and basically what that means is you have the ability to craft create ink a magical tattoo but no other magic items so basically for one feet you can specialize in uh in magical tattoos and you'll get a uh at minimum a plus one bonus to crafting those tattoos but it does not give you the ability to craft any other magic items or the other path is you take the magical crafting feat which will let you create and craft you magic swords magic runes magic hats magic flying carpets magic bags magic Scrolls all that stuff and then have to also take the specialty crafting feet in in in addition to that in order to craft uh magical tattoos now why magic tattoos are treated differently than everything else and all the other magical items I don't know um if you have insight to this or you you have an idea please let me know in the comments it does seem odd to me that uh the magical crafting feat is a blanket feat that will let you do all those things I previously mentioned Scrolls ones swords armor uh gemstones magic bags just you can create everything with that except tattoos tattoos are special we're going to separate those out and make you take a uh a second feed if you want to do those now I understand in the real world the Artistry involved in in drawing and ining a tattoo is radically different than blacksmithing a suit of armor um but mechanically within Pathfinder second edition they've largely said we we don't want to get involved in a million different Feats for a million different uh a million different ways to craft we're just going to have one crafting skill we going to have one you know basically three crafting Feats uh you if they're breaking out magic items and a chemical crafting and snares um it just seems weird to me that tattooing wouldn't just be under the umbrella of um of other magic items for the sake of Simplicity in this more simplified rule system but uh that's the way it works if you want to craft a magical tattoo uh is going to work the same as crafting any other magic item you're going to either need the formula for the type of magical tattoo you're going to be inking or you're going to need to be working off a copy of it if you have the formula uh in the remaster edition if you have the formula that's going to reduce the time required to only one day uh minimum um may go longer as usual after that first day you're going to buy out the balance you put 50% of the cost uh on day one and then at the end of day one you can either pay off the other 50% or work for another additional day or further lowering the balance required by the am the amount found on the um on an income table if any of that sounds weird or unfamiliar check out my other videos about crafting that go over the U the general crafting rules but uh that's it for for today if you have any questions about crafting magical tattoos please leave them in the comments below and as always I want to take a moment to say thank you to everybody out there who supports me in this
