hey everybody Dave here and today I want to talk about a few of the things that people migrating from 5e over to Pathfinder second edition uh specifically Pathfinder second edition remastered may want to know when they come to that table for the first time I've noticed a a bit of a an influx of uh people coming over to the game from 5e lately and in my own game I believe every single one of my players also plays in a different 5e game so sometimes they come to the table and get a little confused on what rules are and how things work and for people coming over from 5e uh I know a familiar experience is you have a friend who's running a Pathfinder game and they say hey come over and play with us some night and that 5V player says well you know I really don't want to have to learn a new system so their friend says don't worry about it if you know how to play 5 you know how to play Pathfinder is the same thing and then that person shows up at the Pathfinder game only to realize that it's the same except for this this this this this and so on so that's what this video is going to try to uh to tackle uh I am going to go over a number of the um the tripping points that uh I've seen at my table for 5e players coming into Pathfinder and this is a pretty long list so uh first things is not going to be all inclusive of all the changes I'm not going to go into specific differences between classes this is all going to be General and a lot of rules have exceptions which I won't be going into each and every exception either but this should give you a really good idea of the key things that you might want to know when making that that conversion from from dndd 5e over to Pathfinder second edition remastered and uh if you're new to Pathfinder you're probably new to this channel so I guess first of all just let me say oh welcome on behalf of the Pathfinder Community welcome to uh to our our side of the tabletop RPG space and welcome to this channel uh I create uh rules instruction videos and one of the reasons why I'm not going to go into all the detail of the things I'm going to be talking about today is because odds are I probably have a more detailed video that goes into these things and so if you're not clear on something that I I say or share in this video uh check out the comment section I'll have a a pinned to the top of it a list of other videos that you can click on to get more information so with that uh all set up let's go ahead and dive in and the first thing I think 5V players need to know about Pathfinder second edition is the trait system and you are going to want to know your traits so in 5 I believe uh for for for a gear for your weapons there's a table and I think they're called properties in DND D 5e same idea in Pathfinder each weapon's going to have h a set column on the big table that shows their traits we call them traits but the reason why I bring this up is in Pathfinder this goes well beyond just your gear traits are used in every action every feat every spell every saving throw you're going to roll every poison everything uses traits and these traits are great because they save a lot of uh print space on in the books because if you know how a trait works you don't have to repeat the text for that for that piece in every single thing it applies to but uh a lot of these traits really kind of um really kind of modify the way things work in the game uh so if you're especially if you're a spellcaster make sure you look up what the traits for that spell actually mean and do before you cast that spell uh if you are going to cast a spell and it has the incapacity trait make sure you look up incapacitate and know how that's going to uh uh alter or change the expected effects of that spell and U the places you can go to to look up these TR traits very little bit uh officially you can go into the indexes of the books and look up those traits to find the information if you're playing at a table that has uh you know any kind of digital setup use your phone use an iPad whatever uh you can go to the archive of nethys which is the official Pathfinder uh online rules repository and search for the traits there uh another place you can go to is PFE easy PFE easy tools is a is a similar um web-based uh you know index of all the different rules and whatnot and that's another place you can go to to to quickly search for these traits um another thing I want to talk about is going to be how success and failure Works in Pathfinder second edition so in Pathfinder there are four degrees of success which are going to be very familiar to D and players you know your critical success your regular success your regular failure and your critical failure uh but what may be different is those four degrees of success apply to pretty much everything uh pretty much every skill you you use is going to have these four degrees of success so yes you can critically succeed on your skills and critically fail at your skills as well anytime you roll a saving throw there are going to be those same four degrees of success so you can critically succeed and critically and critically fail on your saving throws and uh one of the main reasons why you should understand that is because the way you determine if your action is a critical success or a critical failure is a little bit different and Pathfinder than it is in dndd 5e uh so you may be accustomed to every time you roll a natural 20 on the die critical hit critical success every time you roll natural one critical failure uh uh critical Miss however you want to put that but in um in Pathfinder there is one more very important way that you can score a critical success or a critical failure and that is by hitting a DC that is 10 higher or 10 lower than the regular DC so for example if you're trying to hit a DC 15 you roll a natural 19 but your modified total is a 25 that's 10 more than the target DC so that's a critical hit or a critical success if you're doing a Skiller and whatnot and the same is true for failures if you if you're if you don't roll a natural one maybe roll a natural two or natural three and your final total is 10 below what the target number is you get a critical failure so this is this is great not just in the sense of it gives you more ways to critically succeed and critical fail but it also makes every plus one uh or minus one on any role much more significant because you're not just increasing your odds of success you're increasing your odds of critical succeeding and you're decreasing your odds of having a critical failure so um that makes every little bonus you can get a little more important and opponent also something to be aware of here is that just because you roll a natural 20one does not guarantee a critical success or a critical hit and vice versa just because you're rooll a natural one does not necessarily mean a a critical failure what happens when you roll a natural 20 is you you add your bonus to it and you compare that bonus that final total to the target number and then you increase it by one degree of success so say you're trying to hit a target number of 25 you're roll a natural 20 and you've got a plus n to your to as a bonus that you're applying to this 20 + 9 is 29 so 29 versus a target number of 25 that would be a normal success normally but because you roll a natural 20 you increase it one step to a to a critical success but if the target number was say 30 and you roll a natural 20 and you add your plus n bonus to a 29 that would normally be a failure but because you wrote a natural 20 it increases at one step from failure to a regular success not a critical success so this does add a little more complexity to um to I guess the math of your critical successes and critical failures to be completely transparent and honest as long as you're in the ballpark for what you're attempting to do if you're fighting similarly Lev uh enemies this is not going to be an issue a natural 20 should typically be at least a regular success and not a failure for whatever you're doing so it's it's very infrequent that this comes up but it can possibly come up especially if you are in a situation where you're engaging with people who are enemies that are way overleveled or way underleveled um or if you're attempting to use a skill that you have training in or minimal training in to do something very difficult this could come up as well but just know um by the rules is written a 20 is not always a critical success and a one is not always a critical failure uh another thing to talk about is how we calculate critical damage so when you when you do roll that critical success a critical hit the way you calculate your damage in Pathfinder is you roll your damage and you multiply that final damage by two and right now I'm sure there are 5 players out there saying what are you talking about Dave that's that's no different than than d and d d andd you get your double damage on a critical hit but it is a little different because in Pathfinder what you do is you just pretend you didn't roll a critical success just pretend you didn't roll a critical success roll it like it was a regular success and then double it uh so what that means is your those static bonuses your strength bonus that gets double too you're if you're a rogue and you're sneak attacking somebody that sneak attack damage gets double to if you just pretend you didn't roll a critical success you roll the damage add everything together uh sneake attack damage Precision damage uh if you have a flaming sword the the the Flaming one6 extra flaming damage you add that your static bonuses everything you add together and then you multiply it by two as opposed to the way I believe 5e Works where you don't get to double that uh strength bonus that static damage you don't get to double some other things and Pathfinder like I said pretend you did not roll a critical success roll it as normal and multiply it by two now at the beginning of this video I said that I wasn't going to go into every exception but this is an area that I will go into uh a little bit of an exception and that exception is if there's any effector modifier that specifically only occurs on a critical hit if you're if you're if you are are casting a spell it it might give you special text for what happens on a critical success or a critical hit and you're going to follow that rule as opposed to the more general rule of you just rule it like normal and multiply by two uh also there are certain weapon traits uh like I mentioned before know your traits there are two traits to know and those are deadly and fatal the deadly and fatal traits that belong to weapons modify how they function when they deliver Critical Hits so if you're using a weapon that has one of those two traits you're going to want to make sure that you read those traits and understand how they modify this the good news is is going to in both those cases is going to increase the damage but if you don't have a weapon that has the one of these traits like deadly or fatal uh the general rule thumb is going to work in most cases pretend you did not roll a critical hit just roll it normal add everything together multiply it by two so um while we're still talking about uh our our checks and our our four degrees of success and whatnot we should probably talk a little bit about DCS or difficulty classes one of the things that often comes up in my games from 5 players coming over to the table is I might ask them for a a specific DC and I might ask a player what is your perception DC and that player looks all over their sheet and they say I I I I don't see perception DC listed anywhere whenever uh a GM asks you what a a DC is find the corresponding uh skill or saving throw or whatever and just add 10 so if you have a plus eight bonus to perception and your GMS you what's your perception DC you just add 10 to it a plus eight bonus becomes a perception DC of 18 if you have a plus 12 bonus to stealth your stealth DC is 22 if you have a plus six um reflex saving throw bonus then your reflex DC is going to be 16 anytime your GM asks you what a DC is find the corresponding ability and just add 10 to it it's that easy also talking about uh our DCS and our skills uh you might be interested to know that there are no opposed roles in Pathfinder with one possible little asteris which I'll talk about a little bit later so what this means is you might be accustomed to if you're a rogue and you're you're you're trying to sneak past a guard you would roll your your stealth skill the the DM would roll the perception check for that uh for that guard and then whoever has the highest wins that's not the way it works in Pathfinder and Pathfinder whoever is performing the action roles the dice and you compare it to the static DC of of the other party so if you're a player you're a rogue you're trying to sneak past a guard you would roll 1 D20 add your stealth score that's your that's what you're you're rolling for you're sneaking past this guard that is compared to that guard's perception DC kind of like passive perception although we don't use that term in this game and it's probably best that you not even think of it that way but whatever their perception bonus is you add 10 to it that's the Target number that the Rogue needs to beat in order to sneak past them on that on that uh guard's turn if they want to spend one of their actions to actively search the area for any Intruders then they would roll 1 D20 and add their perception bonus because they're the active uh character in that point in time and that would be compared to the stealth DC of the sneaking player they would not roll their Ste stealth score again nor would they use the total of the stealth score that they rolled the previous round is going to be our are DCs are what um all the active roles are compared to no opposed roles another thing to uh consider is going to be how saving throws work uh well first of all saving throws are this is old school goes back to like third and maybe even fourth edition D and D this only three saving throws uh reflex fortitude and will as opposed to being one for all six of the different ability scores that's not going to be too hard for you to wrap your heads around I imagine but you're going to see text that says roll a quote basic saving through uh and this is most common in spells and this is like traits this is an area where they're using a little bit of a shorthand to prevent having to retype the exact same information a 100 times for a 100 different spells but what you need to know when you see uh a basic saving throw is all that means is you roll your saving throw and if you get a critical success you suffer no damage if you roll a regular success you suffer half damage if you roll a regular failure you suffer the full damage and on a critical failure you suffer double damage so you're only going to see the words basic saving throw applied to effects that deal damage and that's all it means is it will say roll a basic if you look at a fireball it's going to tell you to roll a basic reflex saving throw versus an amount of damage and they're not going to spin page space telling you that on a critical success you suffer no damage on a regular success you suffer half damage Dage on a regular failure you suffer normal damage and on a critical failure you suffer double damage they're just going to make that stat block real small and concise know that when you see that word basic that's what it means also don't assume that a damaging effect follows those rules if it says to make a a reflex save and does not say basic then you do not apply that staggered process you would just apply whatever the effect listed the U description of that spell or other ability would be all right so now let's move on to the action economy uh this is one of the major features of Pathfinder second edition uh I think most people um view this more favorably than in 5e but basically you are given three actions on your turn and one reaction that you can spend during someone else's turn including during an enemy's turn but but your three actions during your turn can be used for basically anything uh you so that means if you want to attack somebody that's going to be one of your actions if you want to move at your speed score that's going to be another action uh if you want to take any other actions then there's likely going to be a number of Errors at the top of that actions description and those errors tell you how many actions you have to spend to do the thing so for example most spells are going to have two little arrows at the top which means it costs two actions to cast that spell and so this gives you a lot of flexibility in how you can you can operate on every turn um but there are some particular things I want to make sure I cover here uh first is multiple attacks so yes you got three XS a turn if you start your turn standing adjacent to your enemy you can spend all three of your actions to make three attacks but there is was known as the multiple attack penalty which just uh means every attack after the first is going to suffer a penalty so your first attack every turn whether it's your first action of that turn or your last can be made with no penalty at all your second attack in a turn is going to suffer a ne5 multiple attack penalty and your third and possibly fourth and and future attacks at turn will all be made at at -10 so yes you can attack three times per turn just make sure that that second attack you're suffering a neg five and the third attack you're suffering a -10 uh the key exception to this is again know your traits some weapons uh have the agile trait so these are typically light weapons like a dagger and the agile trait reduces that multiple attack penalty from the second attack being5 to only being4 and your third attack in all future attacks from being -10 to being8 generally speaking uh it's not a great idea statistically speaking to attack three times that -10 or even negative 8 penalty is pretty harsh so you might want to think about other things to do with that third action uh the most frequent things would be raising your Shield important thing to know and under second addition just having a shield strapped to your arm does not give you a bonus to your armor class you must spin an action to raise that shield in order to receive that bonus so if you attack twice you don't want to suffer a negative 10 to that third attack I'm going to spend that third action to raise my shield you can also use that third action to uh perform recall knowledge see what you know about this enemy do you know any of its weaknesses that you might be able to exploit that actually might be something that you do with your first action so that you might be able to exploit that weakness with your second action which would be your attack another thing you might want to do with that third action is to move away from your enemy so we should talk a little bit about how attacks of opportunity or what I believe in fifth Ed is called opportunity attacks in Pathfinder second edition remastered these are now called reactive strikes um but it's basically the idea if your enemy moves away from you you get a sucker punch him you get a free attack on him so the first thing to know about opportunity attacks or what we call reactive strikes is that not everybody has them in fact they are fairly rare especially in the early levels uh Fighters get them by default all fighters will have them uh other Marshall classes can typically choose them with one of their feet as they level up and some monsters that um that you might expect to have that kind of Marshall prowess have them but not everybody has them and this is a wonderful thing because what this does is it really opens up that entire map for you to use in a fight uh my experience with uh 5e in earlier games like 3E has been that you get into melee combat and people get rooted they just stand still and and just blow leging each other until somebody dies because nobody wants to move away and risk triggering that opportunity teack or reactive strike but in Pathfinder they're fairly rare so that means you shouldn't be afraid to move away from most enemies if you're fighting somebody who seems like they are a fighter by class you can pretty much expect they're going to have opportunity attacks for reactive strikes everybody else you might want to test it out try a gamble whatever but this really opens up the entire map for you to move around and not feel rooted in place also be aware that in 5e I believe uh opportunity attacks are triggered when you move away from your opponent um so in 5V you can circle around your opponent as long as you remain within their threatened area the reach of their weapon that's not the way it works in Pathfinder um by raw if you leave a square that is threatened by an opponent and that opponent has reactive strike that can trigger it also be aware that other classes have other things that can trigger like an opportunity attack when you move away from them uh that function a little differently uh I believe a barbarians have an ability that let them follow you so when you try to move away from them that triggers their reaction that they can have a free stride that they just stay Pace with you so you can't escape them uh and monks have an ability called Stand still that when you try to leave your space and get away from them they get a free attack to try to trip you and knock you down uh so just be aware that there other there are other reactions that can't Trigg but generally speaking what you need to know not everybody can do opportunity attacks uh another thing to know uh about movement and this is a little bit of a point of contion that a lot of my 5 players don't like but I think um they warm up too once they kind of understand how this action economy works and that is in Pathfinder you cannot split your movement so you may be used to if you can move 30 feet in a turn you can move 15 feet attack somebody move 15 more feet in Pathfinder it takes one action for you to stride up to your speed and then would be a second action to attack and then if you wanted to uh move again you would have to spend your third attack even if you didn't use all of your speed on your first attack and um a lot of 5V players don't don't like this uh generally speaking um I think it's a bit of a wash because in Pathfinder we have three actions that we can spin on anything and so in D and D you're used to moving 15 ft attacking and moving 15 more feet in D and D you can still do or in I'm sorry in Pathfinder you can still do that you can still move attack and move in your turn it's just you spend your first action to move your second action to attack and your third action to move again uh and I understand that bonus actions and some other things may modify how that works and that's same in in in Pathfinder uh we don't have bonus actions but we do have other Feats and things that might modify this but long story short what you need to know you cannot split your actions so there is one very big exception to this in the GM core rulebook it does empower the game master to make sort of Common Sense uh adaptations to this so say you're standing 5 feet away from um from a wall you want to climb by raw you spend your first action to move 5et your second action to climb that wall and then your third action either to keep climbing or do something at the top or whatever the GM uh core rule book does say that game Masters don't get too silly with this if you want to you can include the five feet of that movement in your climbing uh and not make it cause two actions and not not make someone with a speed score of 35 feet have to spin an action to only step five feet so um but generally speaking you cannot split your movement GMS know that you are empowered to play with that however makes sense in your games uh let's see what next is on the list oh I talked a little bit um earlier about how spells typically cost two actions but I do want to talk about some spells that cost uh either three actions or one action typically anytime you summon a creature you're summon animal spells summon Dragon summon plant all your summon abilities those are going to cost three actions uh and typically be your entire turn to summon that extra creature onto the field other spells most notably the heal spell you can cast it with only one action and when you do it that way you have a range of touch with your healing spell so you can either heal yourself or someone adjacent to you for only one action for two actions it becomes a ranged healing spell and heals a little more and if you cast that spell with three actions it becomes an emanation and you heal everybody around you in that emanation um and that's all for one spell slot uh this doesn't alter how your spell slots are spent it only Alters the number of actions you have to use to cast the spell and the effects the more actions you spend the more benefits you get um but that only applies to spells like heal that specifically call that out talking about spellcasting um this is an area another area that um 5 players often uh find a little confusing Pathfinder second edition uses old school vanan spellcasting rules for their prepared spellcasters all our spell spellcasters fall into the category of either being prepared spellcast or spontaneous spellcasters so this mostly is going to apply or entirely apply to our um our prepared spellcasters so typically we're talking about our Wizards and our clerics and a few others but those are the the two major ones as a prepared spellcaster in the morning as part of your daily preparations you pick every spell slot and you assign a specific spell to that slot so when you prepare in the beginning of the day you you set in stone I have these spells and for this specific spell slot I can only cast this spell at this level and so on and so on and so on and so you don't have as much flexibility whereas like in 5e you prepare a number of spells of from your spell book but you have flexibility in casting those spells throughout your day that's not the way it works in Pathfinder if you're a prepared spellcaster at the beginning of the day you more or less edgeing Stone how you're going to spend each spell slot and what the coresponding spell will be there are uh exceptions to that uh there are ways Wizards can can swap a spell or or modify how that works I'm not getting into all those exceptions the key thing to know prepare spellcasters at the beginning of the day you prepare your spells and you're locked in to those specific spells uh so that means um if you don't prepare to cast uh a to cast fly multiple times you can't cast it multiple times you're you're locked in a lot of people coming over from 5 do not like this they want the freedom they had in 5 and the great news is is there is an archetype called flexible preparation you can find it in the book secrets of magic you can also find it on archives of nth this or easy tools or any of those other online uh platforms and I think this is an optional archetype so you'll have to get permission from your GMS to use it but if you are a prepared spellcaster and you take the flexible preparation archetype it more or less makes those classes function exactly the way you're used to them functioning in fifth edition uh the downside is you have one fewer spell per level you cast per day but the benefit is you have a whole lot more uh um uh freedom of choice and how you spend your spell slots and keeping on with our discussion of spells uh let's talk about concentration spells in 5e you are used to only being able to cast one concentration spell at a time uh and you may go through the Pathfinder rle book The Player's core book look through the Spells and you notice like I told you remember those tag those traits those tags at the top of these things and you'll see different spells that have the concentrate trait or tag assigned to them and your natural assumption is that means I can only if I have multiple spells that have the concentrate trait I can only keep one of these running at a time that is not what that means in Pathfinder in fact for for uh the moment Let's ignore the concentrate trait all together those spells that you're used to where you can keep them persisting turn after turn after turn as long as you're able to concentrate on them in Pathfinder we call those sustain spells so if you see a spell that has a duration listed as sustain what that means is every turn after the first you have to spend one action to sustain that spell you spend an action and it extends the duration of that spell for one round so on your next turn if you want to keep that spells effect going you have to spend one action to sustain it again and so on and so on and so on until you either decide not to sustain it anymore or until you're noted unconscious or whatever and can't act to sustain it the key thing to know here is that there is no limit to that no limit in sense of of you can only concentrate on one spell at a time you have three actions per turn if you wanted to you could sustain three sustained Spells at a time uh it would be difficult to get three sustained spells cast um but mathematically it's possible that you could have three sustained spells active and spin your three actions to sustain them every turn to keep all three of them going you wouldn't be able to do anything else that turn so when you're used to having that limitation of one concentration spell going just know that in Pathfinder we call those sustain spells and you'll look for the duration of sustain and just know one action to keep those going turn after turn so what does that mean when we see the concentrate trait or tag applied to these if we don't have to concentrate to keep them going what does that concentrate tag or trait mean in and of itself that that trait doesn't mean anything what that is there is for other effects to interact with the ability so for example if you're a barbarian and you're raging you cannot use any action that has the concentrate trait because you're so fuel of rage and anger you can't concentrate so if you were a a barbarian who could cast spells you cannot cast any spell with the concentrate trait while you are raging that's one example uh so just like I said I'm not going to go into all the specifics in this video just know that when you see that concentrate tradeit it does not mean that you can only keep one of the Spells active at that time it just means there's other abilities that might impose limitations on how they can function with concentrate abilities if you want to know the rules for keeping spells active persistently from turn after turn that's sustain is what you're going to look for uh another thing to talk about is going to be initiative uh you are probably accustomed to initiative bonuses being based on dexterity and Pathfinder um well first of on Pathfinder you can use pretty much any skill for your initiative it comes down to what you were doing at the time the GM calls for initiative so if you were um keeping an eyee out on a tree line your Druid you're using the nature skill you might notice uh a fluck of birds come out of the bushes before goblins jump out to attack you if you were scanning that the area you might be able to convince your GM to let you use your nature skill as your initiative score because in Pathfinder it's not based on on dexterity it's not based on how fast you can draw your weapon is based on perception it's based on how soon you can can realize you're in danger and so rule of thumb if there's something you were doing at the time initiative is called you might be able to use that skill um as your initiative score another example is you're a rogue you're going to initiate con combat by jumping on a chandelier doing a back flip off of it well you know what if that's what you're doing to initiate combat AGM can I roll my acrobatic skill as my initiative role uh if they're a cool GM they'll probably say Yes um also uh there are times in Social encounters where you can use social skills to uh initiate combat if you are in a social situation and you decide you're just going to throw a punch out of nowhere and punch somebody you might use your deception skill as your initiative because they're not going to see that punch coming so long story short and um and Pathfinder any skill can be used as your initiative role provided that you were basically doing that thing at the time initiative was called for and your GM agrees uh that that's allowable uh your default initiative is going to be your perception score w20 plus your perception bonus is the default usual initiative role because again it's not based on how fast you can pull your sword out it's based on how quickly you can realize your in danger uh something to know about action economy that is related to initiative is in Pathfinder there are two ways you can modify your place in the initiative order and that's through the delay through delaying and through readying um in D and D5 you're used to being able to ready an action that's nothing new except that in Pathfinder it takes two actions to ready so on your turn you'll say I'm going to spend these two actions and I'm going to ready this action to perform later during somebody else's turn but the key difference about initiative and Pathfinder is delay uh you're never going to be penalize for Rolling too well on initiative you might win initiative but say you know know what I'd rather have my tanks get out in front of me before I act but they rolled lower in the initiative and Pathfinder you can basically voluntarily lower your initiative score as low as you like so you can drop down to an initiative score below your your allies let them go first and then take your turn so this is somewhat similar to what you're used to in 5 where you might be first in the initiative order and use your your ready action to say I'm going to wait until my more tanky allies move first and then as my readed action I'm going to follow after them or do something like that the key difference here is in 5e a readed action is One Singular action you you prepare to do that one action uh later in initiative as a result of something else whereas in Pathfinder when you delay you you do change your place in the initial order and when that comes around you get all three of your actions you get to take your full term then and your place in the initiative order remains in that place going forward so the next thing I want to talk about is uh a thing called secret checks that exist in Pathfinder second edition so as the name applies a secret check is a skill or something else that is rolled on the players behalf by the GM in secret behind behind their screen and uh so the GM rolls it for the players and does not necessarily tell them uh it certainly does not tell them the numerical result it may not even tell them if they succeeded or failed so this is for those situations where a character within the narrative would not have that knowledge a typical example is any kind of a stealth check or a perception check those are rolled in Secret by the GM so um if you're a person and you're exploring a dungeon and you come to a new room and you say I'm going to before I step in this room I want to check it out I'm going to roll perception to look around the room and see if I spot any danger uh if that's not a secret roll if you roll a 20 on the dying AER bonus and the GM tells you well you don't spot any danger you as a player know for certain there is no danger Butz I rolled a natural 20 and I didn't spot anything and by the same virtue if you roll a natural one and the GM says well you don't findun anything well you go well I didn't see anything but you know hey Tim you know why don't you check out the room too and see if you get a better role in reality in reality when we're doing perception checks boring something you know that would apply a penalty to that check like concealment or flash of light that blinds us or something like that we don't know if we succeeded or failed on these checks we don't know in reality Did We R A one or a 20 or a 10 or whatever all we know is do we see something or do we not so that's where the secret checks come in the GM rolls it in secret adds your perception bonus to the role and just tells you if you saw something or if you didn't see something but you as a player you don't know how well you rolled on that die you don't know if you critically succeeded or critically failed you just know I see something or I do not see something and then you have to act on that information alone secret tcks also come up in knowledge checks if you're wanting to do a knowledge check uh on you find an enemy monster you want to do a knowledge check do I know what kind of monster this is do I want know what its weaknesses are what have you GM rolls that in secret you don't know if if you don't know how well or how poorly you did in most cases unless the GM wants to tell you that um and the main reason for this is because if you critically fail this check then the gam is going to give you false information if you critically fail a knowledge check then you remember things incorrectly or you mistake one monster for another if you roll a natural on the table then as a player you know the information you're getting is bogus um so just be aware that secret checks exist and and uh Pathfinder uh and these will be called out any ability that has again these traits know your traits as the secret trait means the GM rolls it for you on your behalf in secret uh sense motive uh there's new sense motive skill in Pathfinder uh Second Edition and there's no investigation skill either both sense motive and investigation are rolled into perception so if you would like to investigate an area uh or do what you are accustomed to being investigate then that's just going to be a perception check if you want to perform sense motive as you are accustomed to in uh Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition that's just going to be a straight perception check in Pathfinder second edition another thing that we should talk about is resting so uh the concept of short and long rest doesn't exactly exist in Pathfinder the way you're accustomed to them existing and the big Point here is you do not get all of your hit points back on a long rest so I believe in D andd fth Edition long rest you rest for eight hours you heal back to full Pathfinder second edition is not that forgiving which uh I think to most Pathfinder player sensibilities that's a good thing um because to a lot of people frankly spending your day getting bruised and beaten and possibly cut by a weapon or set on fire by a fireball or a dragon's breath to have all that damage just completely go away after uh a good night of sleep um can rub a little bit against immersion for some people in the Pathfinder world but uh long story short what you need to know is you don't instantly heal everything back after a long rest a ni rest instead you're going to heal a number of hit points that are equal to your Constitution modifier times your level with a minimum Constitution modifier of one so if you have a constitution modifier of two and your third level a nice rest is going to heal six hit points if you want to heal anything beyond that you're going to need to uh either have healing spells cast on you use Certain Magical items or do what sort of replaces the hit nice healing on a short rest which is the medicine skill so instead of having a short rest where you roll your hit dice you expend your hit dice to heal a little bit uh you can have someone who's trained in the medicine skill use an ability called treat wounds to try to bandage you up and heal you to a certain degree uh also something to know about is going to be flanking in um in uh Pathfinder second edition flanking is not an optional rule it is baked into the game uh flanking always occurs when you and an ally are on opposite sides or opposite corners of your enemy uh and this can be pushed back a little bit if you have a reach weapon um so if especially if you're a rogue always be looking for flanking because uh flanking is going to impose the offguard uh condition on your enemies and that's what triggers a lot of what you might think of as flanking bonuses um another things to to be aware of in Pathfinder second edition is the system of advantage and disadvantage doesn't entirely exist it kind of exists just is not as frequent so you're used to things being uh simplified to where if you have Advantage you roll two dice you take the higher if you have disadvantage you take roll two dice you take the lower instead in Pathfinder second edition we have static bonuses and penalties that meet all of those uh times when you would normally roll advantage or disadvantage uh if the GM believes that there are certain circumstances in which you would have Advantage instead of you rolling twice your GM would likely tell you well I'm going to give you a plus two circumstance bonus to this role now the concept of rolling twice and taking the higher or taking the lower does exist in Pathfinder second edition these are called Fortune effects uh and I'm not going to go too deep into this because it's relatively rare that they come up if you're playing a halfling you might be able to get halfling luck that would allow you to do something similar to what you think of as as advantage and disadvantage just long story short just understand as you understand advantage and disadvantage in dungeons Dragon fifth edition does not exist in Pathfinder second edition instead there are static modifiers that or and penalties that are applied to things and if you believe believe that you should have advantage on an action because of your character's backstory your history the weather lighting conditions whatever it is your GM is probably going to still give you a a bonus to those moments it's just not going to be Advantage it's just going to be like hey add two to your role I'm going to give you a plus two circumstance bonus and the last thing I want to leave all of you with is the number one question that I get asked by 5e players which is where's DND beyond for Pathfinder what's the DN D Beyond of Pathfinder and there's and sadly there is nothing that is quite as nice as D and D Beyond I I was I was about to say I love D and D Beyond I used to love D and D Beyond I loved it D and D Beyond back when you could do allart allart purchases and say like I just want to buy this one feet I don't want to buy the whole book I believe now they force you to buy the whole book which Hasbro is lame which is probably why you're here in the first place But to answer the question there is really no great one toone comparison of D and D Beyond Pathfinder the closest thing is going to be a a website called demiplane where you can find Pathfinder Nexus that works very similar to D and Beyond in fact I believe it's it's the company that's creating it uh I might have this a little bit wrong but I believe I've been told that that a lot of their staff worked on D and Beyond but is this same general idea you buy digital versions of the books and there's a character builder and you can search for that for that stuff but you have to buy the books digitally to use that platform on a um Demi plane or Pathfinder Nexus uh if you're looking for a really solid character builder I recommend path Builder uh path Builder uh 90% or maybe even 98% of it is free to use um and if you if there is a feature that you want to have uh all you got to do is pay a onetime fee and you unlock everything forever in perpetuity uh and I think that was only a $5 flat charge when I did I don't know if his prices have gone up what have you but path Builder is available um on any on the internet on you know through Chrome or whatever your browser of choices is also available on um Android devices and uh I saw an announcement this very morning that he is working finally at getting path Builder ported over to um to Apple devices on iOS as well they're not there yet but if you look for a good character builder path Builder is the recommendation if you want full feature like D&D Beyond check out Demi plane uh Pathfinder Nexus is part of De plane and if you want an online tool just to look up a rule uh I find PF easy tools to be the um the easiest for me to find what I'm looking for but it's sometime not as complete as archives of nethys which is the official repository on so those two would be uh online resources for you to use so that's it uh I try to make this as brief as possible although I know this is going to be one of my longer videos of key things you should know as a 5e player coming into Pathfinder second edition remastered if you have any questions please leave those in the comments if you're a 5 player and I goofed on anything let me know cuz I actually haven't DMD 5 in a while I do have a playlist of rule videos for path ler fifth edition or for I'm sorry for Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition that you you might find interesting still I'll include those in the comments but I may have tripped up on a particular two let me know um I would appreciate it and as a veteran Pathfinder players if you have tips for all of our new friends is coming in from from Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition let them know in the comments as well uh you know let's let's be welcoming neighbors and invite them all into our happy little community so uh with that I'm going to
