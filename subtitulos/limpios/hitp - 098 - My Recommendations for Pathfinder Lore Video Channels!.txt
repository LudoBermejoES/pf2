hey everybody Dave here with another Pathfinder rule reminder for you and today I'm going to talk a little bit about Pathfinder Allure I'm not going to be creating a lore video for you but instead I'm going to direct you to some wonderful folks who are making lore videos and the reason I'm doing this is because as you probably already know Piezo announced that in a few months they're going to start rolling out a new series of core rulebooks for the remaster editions and as part of that there's going to be a whole lot of changes to the rules as we have them and so with me running a YouTube channel that's dedicated to Pathfinder rules it doesn't really make sense for me to be putting out videos today that may be invalidated in a few months when the remaster uh sets come out the first books of that come out is actually going to be about six months or so before they all come out but at any rate a lot of people out there have been kind enough to share their suggestions with me for things I could do with this channel in the meantime while I'm waiting for all the new rules with the remasters uh to come out and a surprising number of people have been recommending that I get into lore videos if I start making lore videos and this is what really has surprised me is the number of people who have specifically said Dave make lore videos because nobody is making more videos there's nobody out there making more videos so we need somebody to fill that Gap and I'm here to tell you and that that is incredibly not true there's a lot of people out there who are making very very very good high quality lore videos for the Pathfinder setting so that's what I'm doing with this video today I want to connect those of you out there who suggest that I get into lore videos because quote nobody is making them and connect you to the people who are so that's what I'm doing I'm wanting to share with you five YouTube channels that are producing great Valyrian Pathfinder setting lore videos for you so the first of those is going to be a relatively newcomer to the scene called the lore tour and the Lord tour as of right now has about 20 little more than 20 videos they have a series that takes a dive into the different districts of Absalom they have videos that are focused on specific creatures like ghosts and Sea Hags and they also have videos that take a look at different parts of geography in particular they recently put out a video on Atari that I liked so much that I forwarded it out to a group of players who will be joining me in July to start a campaign set in Atari and they all gave me positive feedback on that video as well so I want to make sure everybody checks out the lore tour as one of the places you can go to for lore videos but it's not alone next up we have the Tower of tomes the Tower of tomes has a 60-ish videos all about lore they cover monsters ancestries different deities but with system apart from a lot of the other people out there making lore videos is they have a great series of one minute long shorts that dives into the different types of fiends found in galerion next up we have sir vertigo sir vertigo has over 50 lore videos and these videos cover a wide array of topics including prominent NPCs that I don't see being represented on the other channels and also they provide videos on some of the less commonly covered areas of galerium like the stolen lands and alken star and the last of the channels that are currently producing lore videos that I want to cover is myth keeper recently they have a lot of videos that really focus on locations lots of videos on the different nations of galerian as well as the different planes of the cosmology of the Pathfinder setting but they also have videos covering religion and different ancestries as well and the last Channel providing lore videos I want to share with you is kind of an honorable mention they're called Venture captains and they're no longer active but they produced uh 20 or so videos about lore back in the Pathfinder first edition days and uh not only are they great because the lore videos that they created are still valid today a lot of the history hasn't changed but I want to highlight them because this is the channel that inspired me to become a a YouTube content creator as well I sold their videos about Pathfinder lore and said maybe it'd be fun to make videos about Pathfinder rules so without Venture captains I wouldn't be here so those are five different channels four of them are still actively producing lore videos for the Pathfinder setting so go check these folks out make sure you click the Subscribe buttons make sure you click the like buttons If you like the videos and feel free to come back to this video into this comment section and share your thoughts positive or negative whatever you think about these five different groups I'm sharing today so that's it for today if you have any suggestions for future rule reminder videos please let me know as always I want to take just a quick moment to say thank you to everybody out there who supports me whether that's by clicking the like button on the video subscribing to
