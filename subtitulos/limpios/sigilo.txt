for example there an alert garden
for example there an alert garden they're keeping a watchful eye out then
they're keeping a watchful eye out then
they're keeping a watchful eye out then they roll a perception check against
they roll a perception check against
they roll a perception check against your stealth DC instead of relying on
your stealth DC instead of relying on
your stealth DC instead of relying on their perception DC for example you walk
their perception DC for example you walk
their perception DC for example you walk up to the door of a ballroom with two
up to the door of a ballroom with two
up to the door of a ballroom with two guards standing outside they're checking
guards standing outside they're checking
guards standing outside they're checking guests before they enter for weapons and
guests before they enter for weapons and

took conceal an object is now irrelevant
took conceal an object is now irrelevant when it's the guards turn and they are
when it's the guards turn and they are
when it's the guards turn and they are using seek to search you then it is
using seek to search you then it is
using seek to search you then it is their perception challenged by your
their perception challenged by your
their perception challenged by your static stealth DC this works much the
static stealth DC this works much the

hiding something that you already
hiding something that you already possess if you want to pick something up

possess if you want to pick something up without anyone noticing that you're
without anyone noticing that you're
without anyone noticing that you're picking it up you would use the palm and
picking it up you would use the palm and
picking it up you would use the palm and object application of thievery instead
object application of thievery instead
object application of thievery instead of using the stealth skill
of using the stealth skill
of using the stealth skill the second stealth action is called hide
the second stealth action is called hide
the second stealth action is called hide hide is used when you wish to lower your

hide is used when you wish to lower your state of detection from observed to
state of detection from observed to
state of detection from observed to hidden when you take the hide action you
hidden when you take the hide action you
hidden when you take the hide action you roll a stealth check and compare the
roll a stealth check and compare the
roll a stealth check and compare the total to the perception disease of

anyone who is observing you as long as
anyone who is observing you as long as you are either concealed from them or

have a source of cover then you have nowhere to hide and the attempt
nowhere to hide and the attempt
nowhere to hide and the attempt automatically fails if you do have cover
automatically fails if you do have cover
automatically fails if you do have cover then you add the covers bonus to your
then you add the covers bonus to your
then you add the covers bonus to your stealth check but only for those
stealth check but only for those
stealth check but only for those creatures who are observing you from the
creatures who are observing you from the
creatures who are observing you from the other side of that cover this is
other side of that cover this is
