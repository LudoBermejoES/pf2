[Music] hello and welcome to crafting in Pathfinder second edition remastered part two in the previous video we discussed the process of crafting most common items and in this one we're going to take it a step further and talk about special situations like crafting magic items and forging weapons and armor from precious materials the rules for transferring and upgrading runes will be addressed in a future video that's all about runes also note that this video is for the remastered edition of Pathfinder if your game is using the original Legacy Second Edition rules please see the link in the description for my series that covers those rules and one last Quick disclaimer the examples used in this video all assume you have a formula for the item being crafted so if you're crafting by making a copy of an item instead of using a formula simply simply add one extra day of setup meaning it will take two days of work before you roll your skill check see the previous video in this series if you need more information on how and why that is crafting magic items works exactly like crafting everything else but there are a few points that you will want to pay special attention to First although an item stat block might include different types of that item in most cases each type of a given item will have its own formula for example the stamp block for an animal staff includes three different types regular greater and major you cannot use the formula for a greater animal staff to craft a major animal staff those are considered to be two wholly separate items each using their own formula however there is one key exception to this which is any item where the key difference between types is item level for example the stat block for spacious pouch shows four different types and the key difference between them is item level therefore the same formula can be used to craft any of the four different types of spacious pouches but note that this only applies to items where item level is the main difference between types and each type of the item is the same Rarity for example having the formula to craft one type of Aon Stone cannot be used to craft other types of Aon Stones because each type of Aon stone is wildly different from the others when in doubt the GM will decide if the formula you have can be used for other types of the same item second pay attention to the craft requirements section in the items description this area will show you anything extra needed beyond the norm in the previous video you learned that there are six requirements that must be met before you can start crafting we are essentially adding a seventh requirement here which is simply do whatever is listed under the craft requirements heading often these requirements are going to say something to the effect of Supply a casting of a specific spell at a given rank this means that during the first day of crafting someone must cast the specified spell at the required rank in order for that item to be crafted so for example if you're crafting a major animal staff then someone will need to cast runic body and summon animal at first Rank and then cast animal messenger speak with animals and summon animal again all at second Rank and then cast animal form and summon animal again both at third Rank and summon animal yet again at Fourth Rank and finally animal form Moon frenzy and summon animal all at fifth rank you would not need to cast know the way as part of the crafting process because that is a cantrip and cantrips are not listed rank spells when casting spells to meet a crafting requirement remember these key points first the person who is doing the crafting does not need to be the one casting the spell there's no requirement for them beyond having the magical crafting feat therefore anyone can be the one who actually cast the spell if you're making a fire Fireball scroll you do not need to know how to cast The Fireball spell yourself but instead can have a friend cast the spell for you as part of the crafting process second note that the rules specify that a spell slot must be used when casting the spell to craft a scroll or wand in other words you can't use a charge from a scroll or a wand to cast the spell that's needed to craft another scroll or wand the energy of the spell spell must come from a person in the form of a spell slot third there are no other effects when casting the spell when you cast a fireball spell for the purpose of creating a fireball scroll you're not going to blow up your house instead the energy of the spell is safely transferred to the item and there are no other effects and last when casting a spell as part of a crafting requirement you will likely need to pay any associ cost with casting that spell except if you are making a staff or a wand so for example if you're crafting a rank two lock scroll it says here that there is a cost of six gold worth of precious materials in order to cast lock at second rank if you're making a rank two lock scroll then you must provide that cost in addition to the regular cost of crafting but staves and Wands are different if you're making a rank two to WAND of lock you do not provide any of the usual spell cost when casting the spell as part of the crafting process although I haven't seen it spelled out in the rules I believe the key distinction here is that when someone uses a scroll that scroll is consumed and you don't need to provide spell cons at the time that the scroll is used but with staves and Wands which are not consumables you do need to provide the cost each time the spell cast using the staff or wand and therefore you don't also need to pay the spell cost up front when making the staff or want the bottom line here is that you should only be paying the cost for the spell once per actual use of the spell and while we're on the topic of spells and magic items it may be worth mentioning that magic Scrolls and ons cannot be used to cast cantrips Focus spells or rituals they can only be crafted to cast regular spells you cannot create a one to cast your favorite Focus spell or make a scroll to cast a ritual and also don't make assumptions about when you need to have a spell cast as part of crafting if it doesn't say that you need to then you don't the skeleton key for example casts the breach spell when it's used but does not require a brief spell to be cast when crafting a skeleton key likewise people sometimes assume that potions that cast spells when you drink them require those spells to be cast when you're making and burrowing those potions but it is incredibly rare for that to actually be the case invisibility potions for example do not require anyone to cast the invisibility spell when Brewing them in fact the person who is crafting the invisibility potion doesn't even need to know how to cast that spell or have the ability to cast spells all the information needed to brew that potion is enti Al included in its formula Beyond these few tweaks crafting items regardless of if they are ones squirrels potions wondrous items or whatever they all work exactly as was outlined in the previous video you need to provide 50% of the cost of the materials up front and spend one day working with the formula at the end of which you make a crafting skill check if successful you can either choose to pay off the remaining balance or spend another day working to lower that balance and since potions and squirrels are consumable items they can be made in batches of four in addition to magic items we also want to discuss forging weapons and items with uncommon materials the items we discussed in our crafting part one video assume that you are using mundane materials like wood or iron but in the world of Pathfinder there are many more exotic materials that can be used when craftting such as silver or Adam mantin crafting weapons or armor with special materials is pretty simple it works just like regular crafting but there are a few special points that we need to discuss as usual you must provide materials equal to 50% of the items price up front but if you're making something with precious materials you can't just pay the cost of that out of your pocket in gold coins instead you have to somehow Source the precious material that's needed as well for example you want to craft a cold Iron Warhammer when we look up the stats for cold iron weapons we see a few things worth noting first precious materials are categorized as being low grade standard grade or high grade each with their own stats like how magic items are listed with varying types if you're curious what the difference is between the grades of of a material each grade dictates the highest level item that may be crafted from it as well as the highest level of Rune that may be etched upon it low grade materials can be used to craft items up to eighth level and hold runes up to eighth level standard grade materials can be used to craft items and hold runes up to 15th level and highgrade materials can be used to craft items and hold Runes of any level material grades will also affect the hardness hit points and break thresholds of the item made from them we also see it has an item level warhammers are Level zero but when crafting from precious materials you must meet or exceed the level of the base item or the material whichever is higher so you would need to be at least second level to craft a lowgrade cold Iron Warhammer and 10th level to make a standard grade hammer but the big difference comes when we look at Price here price is based on the bulk of the item that we are making in this case a Warhammer is one bulk so a lowgrade cold Iron Warhammer has a price of 40 gold plus four per bulk making the price of this Hammer 44 gold pieces this is the same price for any weapon that is only one bulk you do not add the cost of a normal Warhammer to this also note that you always need to pay for at least one bulk so if the item that you are crafting is light bulk then you treat it as being one bulk for the purpose of calculating its price when we start crafting we must provide materials equal to 50% of the price up front just like always in this case that would be 22 gold worth of materials next we look at the craft requirements line in in the description here it says that of those 22 gold coins 22 Silver pieces of that must be in cold iron all of this special material is needed up front we do not provide 11 silver worth of cold iron now and another 11 silver worth of it later so before we can start crafting we need 198 silver pieces worth of regular General materials and specifically 22 silver pieces worth of cold iron this is all of the cold iron that we will need for this project after one day of work in a skill check we have the option as usual of paying the remaining balance of 11 Gold to complete it but none of that needs to be in cold iron it can be paid as usual with 11 gold pieces we now have a cold Iron Warhammer crafted with lowgrade cold iron and we can etch runes upon it up to eighth level we we will need to upgrade to a standard grade cold Iron Warhammer if we want to use runes that are ninth level or higher crafting armor from precious materials works the same way except you need to adjust its bulk the armor table shows the bulk for each suit of armor assuming that you are wearing it but when crafting you use the Armor's carried bulk which is one more than a suit of Armor's worn bulk to calculate this you simply add one to the bulk that you see listed in the table if you were crafting at a mantain chain mail you would calculate its price using three bulk instead of two in this video we discussed a few more advanced applications of crafting namely crafting magic items and forging weapons and armor from precious materials as a reminder we will be discussing how to craft etch and transfer runes in a future video that's dedicated specifically to the topic of runes if you have any questions please leave them in the comments and as always I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone who supports me in this channel by liking the videos leaving comments and subscribing to the channel or patreon with that thanks for watching take care and happy [Music] gaming
