those penalties against enemies who are not flanking them so how do we determine
not flanking them so how do we determine
not flanking them so how do we determine if a creature is being flanked and
if a creature is being flanked and
if a creature is being flanked and exactly which of its enemies treat them

exactly which of its enemies treat them as being flat-footed in order for a
as being flat-footed in order for a
as being flat-footed in order for a creature to be flanked the following two
creature to be flanked the following two
creature to be flanked the following two conditions must be met first it must
conditions must be met first it must
conditions must be met first it must have enemies on opposite sides or

within reach of both of its enemies if
within reach of both of its enemies if both of these requirements are met then
both of these requirements are met then
both of these requirements are met then the creature is flanked and suffers a

negative to penalty 2s armor class
negative to penalty 2s armor class against attacks made by only those
against attacks made by only those
against attacks made by only those enemies that are flanking it
enemies that are flanking it
enemies that are flanking it let's take a closer look at the two
let's take a closer look at the two
let's take a closer look at the two requirements for flanking by reviewing
requirements for flanking by reviewing
requirements for flanking by reviewing the examples in the core rulebook an
the examples in the core rulebook an
the examples in the core rulebook an example 1 we have Valor Rose and Cara
example 1 we have Valor Rose and Cara
example 1 we have Valor Rose and Cara battling and ogre are they flanking it
battling and ogre are they flanking it
battling and ogre are they flanking it requirement number 1 says the ogre must
requirement number 1 says the ogre must
requirement number 1 says the ogre must have enemies on opposite sides or
have enemies on opposite sides or opposite corners if we draw an imaginary
opposite corners if we draw an imaginary
opposite corners if we draw an imaginary line from the center of valor roses
line from the center of valor roses
line from the center of valor roses Square to the center of Cairo Square we
Square to the center of Cairo Square we
Square to the center of Cairo Square we see that line clearly passes through
see that line clearly passes through
see that line clearly passes through opposite borders of the ogre space so
opposite borders of the ogre space so
opposite borders of the ogre space so the first requirement is met and we can
the first requirement is met and we can
the first requirement is met and we can safely assume they are both wielding
safely assume they are both wielding
safely assume they are both wielding melee weapons so the second requirement
melee weapons so the second requirement
melee weapons so the second requirement is met as well
is met as well
is met as well therefore the ogre is being flanked and
therefore the ogre is being flanked and
therefore the ogre is being flanked and does suffer a negative two penalty to
does suffer a negative two penalty to
does suffer a negative two penalty to its armor class when being attacked by
its armor class when being attacked by
its armor class when being attacked by valorous or kyra in the second example
valorous or kyra in the second example
valorous or kyra in the second example mauricio closes from the north valorous
mauricio closes from the north valorous
mauricio closes from the north valorous in Cara are flanking the ogre but what
in Cara are flanking the ogre but what
in Cara are flanking the ogre but what about Marissa if we draw imaginary lines
about Marissa if we draw imaginary lines
about Marissa if we draw imaginary lines from the center of her Square to the
from the center of her Square to the
from the center of her Square to the middle of both valor Rose in kyra
middle of both valor Rose in kyra
middle of both valor Rose in kyra squares we see that neither of those
squares we see that neither of those
squares we see that neither of those lines pass through opposite borders or
lines pass through opposite borders or
lines pass through opposite borders or opposite corners of the ogre and
opposite corners of the ogre and
opposite corners of the ogre and therefore she is not flanking the ogre
therefore she is not flanking the ogre
therefore she is not flanking the ogre although it suffers a penalty to armor
although it suffers a penalty to armor
although it suffers a penalty to armor class against Valerie Sin Cara the ogre
class against Valerie Sin Cara the ogre
class against Valerie Sin Cara the ogre is not treated as flat-footed against

in the third example Sione and a
in the third example Sione and a Hobgoblin join the battle is Sione being
Hobgoblin join the battle is Sione being
Hobgoblin join the battle is Sione being flanked by the ogre and Hobgoblin in
flanked by the ogre and Hobgoblin in
flanked by the ogre and Hobgoblin in this case yes she is the first
this case yes she is the first
this case yes she is the first requirement says there needs to be
requirement says there needs to be
requirement says there needs to be enemies on opposite borders of her and
enemies on opposite borders of her and
enemies on opposite borders of her and if we draw a line from the center of the
if we draw a line from the center of the
if we draw a line from the center of the ogre to the center of the Hobgoblin we
ogre to the center of the Hobgoblin we
ogre to the center of the Hobgoblin we see it does indeed pass through opposite
see it does indeed pass through opposite
see it does indeed pass through opposite borders of her square and the second
borders of her square and the second

creature the ogre has ten feet of reach
creature the ogre has ten feet of reach therefore the second requirement is met
therefore the second requirement is met
therefore the second requirement is met and Sione is flat-footed against both
and Sione is flat-footed against both
and Sione is flat-footed against both the ogre and the Hobgoblin likewise we
the ogre and the Hobgoblin likewise we
the ogre and the Hobgoblin likewise we should check to see if Sione is flanking
should check to see if Sione is flanking
should check to see if Sione is flanking the ogre well we have Maurizio on the
the ogre well we have Maurizio on the
the ogre well we have Maurizio on the ogres opposite border so that first
ogres opposite border so that first
ogres opposite border so that first requirement is met and the second
requirement is met and the second
requirement is met and the second requirement depends on what weapon Sione
requirement depends on what weapon Sione
requirement depends on what weapon Sione is wielding if she's wielding a dagger
is wielding if she's wielding a dagger
is wielding if she's wielding a dagger then no because a dagger can only reach
then no because a dagger can only reach
then no because a dagger can only reach five feet away which is the adjacent
five feet away which is the adjacent
five feet away which is the adjacent square but if she was wielding a long
square but if she was wielding a long
square but if she was wielding a long spear then she would be flanking the
spear then she would be flanking the
spear then she would be flanking the ogre because long Spears have a reach of
ogre because long Spears have a reach of
ogre because long Spears have a reach of ten feet and at two vertical squares
ten feet and at two vertical squares
ten feet and at two vertical squares away the ogre is ten feet away
away the ogre is ten feet away
away the ogre is ten feet away but what if Sione and the Hobgoblin were
but what if Sione and the Hobgoblin were
but what if Sione and the Hobgoblin were standing over here which Sione still be
standing over here which Sione still be
standing over here which Sione still be flanked by the ogre and the Hobgoblin
flanked by the ogre and the Hobgoblin
flanked by the ogre and the Hobgoblin yes you would still be flanked even
yes you would still be flanked even
yes you would still be flanked even though two squares diagonally is fifteen
though two squares diagonally is fifteen
though two squares diagonally is fifteen feet and the ogre only has ten feet of
feet and the ogre only has ten feet of
feet and the ogre only has ten feet of reach there is an exception to the rule
reach there is an exception to the rule

let's consider Sione moves here
let's consider Sione moves here is she flanking the ocher no because if
is she flanking the ocher no because if
is she flanking the ocher no because if she draws lines from the center of her
she draws lines from the center of her
she draws lines from the center of her square to the center of each of her ally

none of them passed through opposite borders of the ogre
borders of the ogre
borders of the ogre but if Marissa moved here she and Sione
but if Marissa moved here she and Sione
but if Marissa moved here she and Sione would be flanking the ogre because now
would be flanking the ogre because now
would be flanking the ogre because now their line passes through opposite
