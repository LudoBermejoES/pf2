Pathfinder second edition in this video we will cover what perception is how
we will cover what perception is how
we will cover what perception is how it's calculated when players make
it's calculated when players make
it's calculated when players make perception checks and when the GM's
perception checks and when the GM's
perception checks and when the GM's might make their perception checks for
might make their perception checks for
might make their perception checks for them in secret as well as several

character is it allows you to notice things search for what's hidden and tell
things search for what's hidden and tell
things search for what's hidden and tell whether something about a situation is
whether something about a situation is
whether something about a situation is suspicious all creatures have a
suspicious all creatures have a
suspicious all creatures have a perception score and almost everyone has
perception score and almost everyone has
perception score and almost everyone has a proficiency rank of at least trained
a proficiency rank of at least trained
a proficiency rank of at least trained with perception whatever a GM needs to
with perception whatever a GM needs to
with perception whatever a GM needs to test a character's ability to notice
test a character's ability to notice
test a character's ability to notice something they will call for a
something they will call for a
something they will call for a perception check as with other checks
perception check as with other checks
perception check as with other checks this is a d20 role that's modified by
this is a d20 role that's modified by
this is a d20 role that's modified by applicable bonuses and penalties the
applicable bonuses and penalties the
applicable bonuses and penalties the base perception modifier is the
base perception modifier is the
base perception modifier is the creatures wisdom modifier plus their
creatures wisdom modifier plus their
creatures wisdom modifier plus their proficiency bonus in perception so for
proficiency bonus in perception so for
proficiency bonus in perception so for example a first level character who is
example a first level character who is
example a first level character who is trained in perception and has a wisdom
trained in perception and has a wisdom
trained in perception and has a wisdom score of 14 would have a base perception
score of 14 would have a base perception
score of 14 would have a base perception bonus of +5 that's a wisdom score 14
bonus of +5 that's a wisdom score 14
bonus of +5 that's a wisdom score 14 granting a +2 modifier and train
granting a +2 modifier and train
granting a +2 modifier and train proficiency adds to plus the character's
proficiency adds to plus the character's
proficiency adds to plus the character's level for a total of +5 some actions
level for a total of +5 some actions
level for a total of +5 some actions such as sneaking are challenged by the
such as sneaking are challenged by the
such as sneaking are challenged by the witness and character's perception DC
witness and character's perception DC
witness and character's perception DC which is simply calculated as 10 plus
which is simply calculated as 10 plus
which is simply calculated as 10 plus the character's base perception modifier
the character's base perception modifier
the character's base perception modifier for example your character has a small
for example your character has a small
for example your character has a small trinket in their hand that they're
trinket in their hand that they're
trinket in their hand that they're trying to hide from a couple orcs who
trying to hide from a couple orcs who
trying to hide from a couple orcs who are approaching this is a use of the
are approaching this is a use of the
are approaching this is a use of the palm and object application of the
palm and object application of the
palm and object application of the thievery skill so in this scenario you
thievery skill so in this scenario you
thievery skill so in this scenario you would roll a thievery skill check which
would roll a thievery skill check which
would roll a thievery skill check which would be contested by the perception
would be contested by the perception
would be contested by the perception DC's of everyone who is observing you
DC's of everyone who is observing you
DC's of everyone who is observing you the orc step block does not show their
the orc step block does not show their
the orc step block does not show their perception deceive but it does list
perception deceive but it does list
perception deceive but it does list their modifier as being +5 and we know
their modifier as being +5 and we know
their modifier as being +5 and we know that perception DC's are 10 plus the
that perception DC's are 10 plus the
that perception DC's are 10 plus the perception modifier therefore the DC for
perception modifier therefore the DC for
perception modifier therefore the DC for this check is 15 you would roll a d20
this check is 15 you would roll a d20
this check is 15 you would roll a d20 and add your thievery skill bonus if the
and add your thievery skill bonus if the
and add your thievery skill bonus if the total of that check is 15 or higher then
total of that check is 15 or higher then
total of that check is 15 or higher then you succeed and the orcs don't see that
you succeed and the orcs don't see that
you succeed and the orcs don't see that you are hiding a trinket if the total of
you are hiding a trinket if the total of
you are hiding a trinket if the total of the fever check is 14 or lower then you
the fever check is 14 or lower then you
the fever check is 14 or lower then you fail and they can
fail and they can
fail and they can all creatures and objects exist in one
all creatures and objects exist in one
all creatures and objects exist in one of four states of awareness when you are
of four states of awareness when you are
of four states of awareness when you are completely unaware that a creature or an
completely unaware that a creature or an
completely unaware that a creature or an object is present then that creature or
object is present then that creature or
object is present then that creature or object is considered to be on noticed
object is considered to be on noticed
object is considered to be on noticed the unnoticed condition by itself does
the unnoticed condition by itself does
the unnoticed condition by itself does not limit you but anytime a creature is
not limit you but anytime a creature is
not limit you but anytime a creature is unnoticed it is also undetected
unnoticed it is also undetected
unnoticed it is also undetected undetected means you do not know what
undetected means you do not know what
undetected means you do not know what space a creature or object occupies this
space a creature or object occupies this
space a creature or object occupies this could be because you're not even aware
could be because you're not even aware
could be because you're not even aware that it is present and therefore is both
that it is present and therefore is both
that it is present and therefore is both unnoticed and undetected or you could
unnoticed and undetected or you could
unnoticed and undetected or you could suspect that the creatures present but
suspect that the creatures present but
suspect that the creatures present but you don't know exactly where they are in
you don't know exactly where they are in
you don't know exactly where they are in which case that target would only be
which case that target would only be
which case that target would only be undetected for example you're in a dark
undetected for example you're in a dark
undetected for example you're in a dark cave and you hear the sounds of movement
cave and you hear the sounds of movement
cave and you hear the sounds of movement nearby but you can't see what's making
nearby but you can't see what's making
nearby but you can't see what's making the sounds or know exactly where they
the sounds or know exactly where they
the sounds or know exactly where they are in that case that creature would be
are in that case that creature would be
are in that case that creature would be undetected when dealing with an

undetected when dealing with an undetected target you are flat-footed
undetected target you are flat-footed
undetected target you are flat-footed against all of their attacks and
against all of their attacks and
against all of their attacks and although you can't see them to attack
although you can't see them to attack
although you can't see them to attack them directly you can't take your best
them directly you can't take your best

attack into that space when you do so
attack into that space when you do so the GM will make your attack roll for

flat check vs. DC 11 now the only
flat check vs. DC 11 now the only exception of this is if you are making
exception of this is if you are making
exception of this is if you are making an area attack as area attacks are not
an area attack as area attacks are not
an area attack as area attacks are not subject to these flat checks and these
subject to these flat checks and these
subject to these flat checks and these flat checks are meant to represent a
flat checks are meant to represent a
flat checks are meant to represent a 50/50 chance that even if the target is
50/50 chance that even if the target is
50/50 chance that even if the target is in the square that you are attacking you
in the square that you are attacking you
in the square that you are attacking you will miss them because is very difficult
will miss them because is very difficult
will miss them because is very difficult to hit a target that you just can't see
to hit a target that you just can't see
to hit a target that you just can't see and flat checks are just straight d20
and flat checks are just straight d20
and flat checks are just straight d20 rolls with no bonuses or no penalties

surroundings in detail and only a precise sense can be used to observe a
precise sense can be used to observe a
precise sense can be used to observe a target and the only precise is that
target and the only precise is that
target and the only precise is that humans have is vision in priests
humans have is vision in priests
humans have is vision in priests licenses allow you to perceive the
licenses allow you to perceive the
licenses allow you to perceive the presence of something but not with the
presence of something but not with the
presence of something but not with the accuracy in detail of a precise sense
accuracy in detail of a precise sense
accuracy in detail of a precise sense for example humans have hearing which is
for example humans have hearing which is
for example humans have hearing which is an imprecise sense we can use hearing to
an imprecise sense we can use hearing to
an imprecise sense we can use hearing to know that someone is present and may be
know that someone is present and may be
know that someone is present and may be able to even know where they're standing
able to even know where they're standing
able to even know where they're standing but aiming an attack based on hearing
but aiming an attack based on hearing
but aiming an attack based on hearing alone is going to be difficult you
alone is going to be difficult you
alone is going to be difficult you cannot observe a target with an
cannot observe a target with an
cannot observe a target with an imprecise sense so if you detect an
imprecise sense so if you detect an
imprecise sense so if you detect an enemy on hearing alone they would have
enemy on hearing alone they would have
enemy on hearing alone they would have the undetected or hidden conditions
the undetected or hidden conditions
the undetected or hidden conditions instead of observed the third category
instead of observed the third category
instead of observed the third category of senses is vague senses and best vague
of senses is vague senses and best vague
of senses is vague senses and best vague senses can be used to make an unnoticed
senses can be used to make an unnoticed
senses can be used to make an unnoticed creature become undetected but you can't
creature become undetected but you can't
creature become undetected but you can't use a vague sense to make a target
use a vague sense to make a target
use a vague sense to make a target hidden or observed smelling is a vague
hidden or observed smelling is a vague
hidden or observed smelling is a vague sense for humans if you can't see or
sense for humans if you can't see or
sense for humans if you can't see or hear a target there is a chance that you
hear a target there is a chance that you
hear a target there is a chance that you might be able to smell them but this
might be able to smell them but this
might be able to smell them but this wouldn't allow you to accurately place
wouldn't allow you to accurately place
wouldn't allow you to accurately place their location or any great details
their location or any great details
their location or any great details about them therefore that target would

be considered as undetected instead of
be considered as undetected instead of hidden or observed and is worth noting
hidden or observed and is worth noting
hidden or observed and is worth noting that using smelling or any other vague
that using smelling or any other vague
that using smelling or any other vague sense is largely up to the
