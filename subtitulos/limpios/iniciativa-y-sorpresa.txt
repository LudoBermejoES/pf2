the initiative totals are ranked highest
the initiative totals are ranked highest to lowest the character who rolled the

fighting a bugbear in three goblins it
fighting a bugbear in three goblins it might be easiest for the GM to have the
might be easiest for the GM to have the
might be easiest for the GM to have the bugbear act on its initiative and then
bugbear act on its initiative and then
bugbear act on its initiative and then roll initiative once for all of the
roll initiative once for all of the
roll initiative once for all of the other goblins acting together on their

the second major difference between initiative checks and other chicks in
initiative checks and other chicks in
initiative checks and other chicks in the game is there is no definitive
the game is there is no definitive
the game is there is no definitive initiative bonus and this can really

calls for initiative to be rolled since
calls for initiative to be rolled since everyone is out in the open this is
everyone is out in the open this is
everyone is out in the open this is going to be a fairly standard encounter
going to be a fairly standard encounter
going to be a fairly standard encounter all participants are all perception as
all participants are all perception as
all participants are all perception as their initiative bonus the goblins have

for the players
for the players lynnie gets a 24 Maurice your roles a 9
lynnie gets a 24 Maurice your roles a 9
lynnie gets a 24 Maurice your roles a 9 and Ezrin also roles a 9 everyone is
and Ezrin also roles a 9 everyone is
and Ezrin also roles a 9 everyone is then sorted from highest to lowest but
then sorted from highest to lowest but
then sorted from highest to lowest but we see here that there is a three-way
we see here that there is a three-way
we see here that there is a three-way tie between goblin number 4 Mauricio and
tie between goblin number 4 Mauricio and
tie between goblin number 4 Mauricio and ezrin since they all scored a total of 9
ezrin since they all scored a total of 9
ezrin since they all scored a total of 9 with her chicks in case of a tie
with her chicks in case of a tie
with her chicks in case of a tie creatures controlled by the GM win so
creatures controlled by the GM win so
creatures controlled by the GM win so the GM effectively changes goblin 4
the GM effectively changes goblin 4
the GM effectively changes goblin 4 score to 11 and then Mauricio and
score to 11 and then Mauricio and
score to 11 and then Mauricio and ezrin's players decide amongst
ezrin's players decide amongst
ezrin's players decide amongst themselves who should go first between
themselves who should go first between
themselves who should go first between them although there are no official tie
them although there are no official tie
them although there are no official tie breakers they decide that Mauricio
breakers they decide that Mauricio
breakers they decide that Mauricio should go
should go
should go first since her perception bonus is
first since her perception bonus is
first since her perception bonus is higher than ezrin's so the GM changes
higher than ezrin's so the GM changes
higher than ezrin's so the GM changes her score to ten from here combat begins
her score to ten from here combat begins
her score to ten from here combat begins with characters acting in this order now
