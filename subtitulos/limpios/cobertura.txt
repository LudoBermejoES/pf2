empowered to make judgment calls and allow lesser cover to be provided by
allow lesser cover to be provided by
allow lesser cover to be provided by objects instead of just by creatures for
objects instead of just by creatures for

small to hide or to take cover behind
small to hide or to take cover behind and therefore
and therefore
and therefore only provides a lesser cover instead of
only provides a lesser cover instead of
only provides a lesser cover instead of standard cover also note that if the
standard cover also note that if the
standard cover also note that if the creature that is granting cover is at
creature that is granting cover is at
creature that is granting cover is at least two size categories larger than
least two size categories larger than
least two size categories larger than both the attacker and their target then
both the attacker and their target then
both the attacker and their target then the target receives the benefits of
the target receives the benefits of
the target receives the benefits of standard cover instead of lesser cover
standard cover instead of lesser cover
standard cover instead of lesser cover which is usually what is awarded when
which is usually what is awarded when
which is usually what is awarded when the target line passes through a
the target line passes through a
the target line passes through a creature likewise if the target is
creature likewise if the target is
creature likewise if the target is significantly larger than the object
significantly larger than the object
significantly larger than the object that is granting it cover
that is granting it cover
that is granting it cover then the GM may rule that they receive
then the GM may rule that they receive
then the GM may rule that they receive no cover benefits from that object for
no cover benefits from that object for
no cover benefits from that object for example if a huge sized dragon is
example if a huge sized dragon is
example if a huge sized dragon is standing behind a single tree the target
standing behind a single tree the target
standing behind a single tree the target line might pass through that single tree
line might pass through that single tree
line might pass through that single tree on the map but the GM may determine that
on the map but the GM may determine that
on the map but the GM may determine that that is just not enough to provide
that is just not enough to provide
that is just not enough to provide significant cover to the dragon and
significant cover to the dragon and
significant cover to the dragon and therefore either provide less recover or
therefore either provide less recover or
therefore either provide less recover or no cover at all
no cover at all
no cover at all with all of that in mind let's look at a
with all of that in mind let's look at a
with all of that in mind let's look at a few examples first we have valorous
few examples first we have valorous
few examples first we have valorous fighting and over he is adjacent with
fighting and over he is adjacent with
fighting and over he is adjacent with nothing between him and the ogre so
nothing between him and the ogre so
nothing between him and the ogre so there is no cover in this situation this
there is no cover in this situation this
there is no cover in this situation this is a pretty simple example for the
is a pretty simple example for the
is a pretty simple example for the second example let's consider Sione if
second example let's consider Sione if
second example let's consider Sione if we draw a line from the center of her
we draw a line from the center of her
we draw a line from the center of her space to the center of the ogre space we
space to the center of the ogre space we
space to the center of the ogre space we see it does not pass through any objects
see it does not pass through any objects
see it does not pass through any objects but it does pass through a creature
but it does pass through a creature
but it does pass through a creature which is valorous and therefore the ogre
which is valorous and therefore the ogre
which is valorous and therefore the ogre does receive the benefits of lesser
does receive the benefits of lesser
does receive the benefits of lesser cover it doesn't matter that valorous is
cover it doesn't matter that valorous is
cover it doesn't matter that valorous is Sione our allies his presence still
Sione our allies his presence still
Sione our allies his presence still grants the ogre cover in the third
grants the ogre cover in the third
grants the ogre cover in the third example mauricio wishes to attack the
example mauricio wishes to attack the
example mauricio wishes to attack the ogre from around the corner if we draw a
ogre from around the corner if we draw a
ogre from around the corner if we draw a line from the center of her space to the
line from the center of her space to the
line from the center of her space to the center of the ogre space we see it does
center of the ogre space we see it does
center of the ogre space we see it does pass through the edge of the building
pass through the edge of the building
pass through the edge of the building and would grant the ogre the benefits of
and would grant the ogre the benefits of
and would grant the ogre the benefits of standard cover that's the rule by raw

and then draw your line from any corner
and then draw your line from any corner of your space to the center of your
of your space to the center of your
of your space to the center of your target space instead of drawing it from
target space instead of drawing it from

the center of your space to the center
the center of your space to the center of their space and in our fourth example
of their space and in our fourth example
of their space and in our fourth example Kyra wishes to make a ranged attack we
Kyra wishes to make a ranged attack we
Kyra wishes to make a ranged attack we draw our line and see it clearly passes
draw our line and see it clearly passes
draw our line and see it clearly passes through this building next we should
through this building next we should
through this building next we should think about line of effect that's an
think about line of effect that's an
think about line of effect that's an awful lot of building between her and
awful lot of building between her and
awful lot of building between her and the ogre so would it even be possible
the ogre so would it even be possible
the ogre so would it even be possible for her to hit that target for this
for her to hit that target for this
for her to hit that target for this example we'll say that the GM determined
example we'll say that the GM determined
example we'll say that the GM determined that even at this angle Kyra can see the
that even at this angle Kyra can see the
that even at this angle Kyra can see the ogre and there is narrow line of effect
ogre and there is narrow line of effect
ogre and there is narrow line of effect usually when the target line passes
usually when the target line passes
usually when the target line passes through an object the target receives
through an object the target receives
through an object the target receives the benefits of standard cover but in
