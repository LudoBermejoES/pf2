[Music] hello and welcome to crafting examples for Pathfinder second edition remastered if you haven't already watched our video on basic crafting rules you should probably do so before viewing this example a link to that video may be found in the description also this video follows the rules provided in the re mastered version of Pathfinder second edition if your game is using the original Legacy Second Edition rules then please see a link in the description that will take you to my series on Legacy crafting in this example gamra is going to craft a suit of half plate armor she has third level with trained proficiency and crafting and a skill bonus of plus six the first requirement is item level there is no item level listed for half plate armor so it defaults to item level zero gima is third level so she meets this requirement the second requirement is proficiency as a zero level item trained proficiency is all that is needed to craft this third does she need a special feat to make half-plate armor it's not magical alchemical or a snare so she does not need any Feats to make this fourth does she have the proper tools we'll say she purchased an artisan toolkit and labeled it as smithing tools on her character sheet and the local blacksmith is letting her use their Forge so this requirement is covered fifth does she have a formula for half plate armor technically she doesn't need a formula to make half plate since it is common Rarity but we'll say that she purchased a basic crafter's book and therefore does have the formula since that book includes all of the level zero common items that are found in chapter 6 of of the player core book which does include Half plate armor and the last requirement is materials half plate is listed with a price of 18 gold pieces so she must provide nine gold up front to begin her work and must provide 18 gold worth of materials or discounts in order to complete the armor set she spends one day of downtime working on the armor at the end of which her player rolles a crafting skill check note that she is able to roll this check after only one day of work because she has the formula if she was not crafting with the formula she would need to spend two days of downtime working before rolling this check she rolls her crafting skill and the GM compares the total to a DC that they set in secret for this we'll say the GM set a DC of 14 gima rolls ad20 and adds her crafting bonus of plus 6 if she rolls a seven on the die then she fails which means that her day of work was wasted but she still gets her nine gold pieces worth of materials back and can try again tomorrow if she rolls a natural one then she critically fails and not only wasted her day of work but also loses 10% of the materials in this case we convert the nine gold pieces to 90 silver pieces and she loses 10% of that or nine silver leaving her with 81 silver pieces worth of material she can start the process over and try again provided that she can replace the nine silver pieces worth of lost materials but if gimmer rolls an eight or higher on the die then she succeeds she now has two options the half plate armor has a remaining balance of nine gold pieces that needs to be covered she can either pay that N9 gold and instantly finish her work or she can spend another day of work to lower that balance she decides to invest another day into crafting the armor to learn how much this lowers the remaining balance buy we need to look at the income earned table on page 229 of player Core 1 gima is third level and trained so every extra day of work lowers the remaining balance by five silver pieces if she had rolled a critical success then she would be treated as if she was fourth level and would lower the balance by seven silver pieces after each extra day of work but for this example we're going to say that she succeeded but not critically succeeded so after the second day of work the remaining balance lowers from nine gold pieces to eight gold and five silver or it might just be easier to call it 85 silver pieces at this rate it will take take her more than 2 weeks of additional work to finish the suit of armor but she only expects to have three more days of down time before her party leaves town to continue their Adventures so she decides to spend the rest of her available time working on the armor which lowers the remaining balance from 85 silver to 70 and at the end of the fifth day of work she pays the remaining 70 silver pieces to finish her suit of half plate armor she and her GM are provided as much flexibility as they like to explain this within the narrative it's unlikely that on the evening and the fifth day gima simply threw seven gold coins at the half finished suit of armor and it magically completed instead she and her GM decide to explain the final expense as money she paid to a trio of local Apprentice blacksmith who assisted her throughout the process so she could complete the entire suit of armor in only 5 days if you would like to see the companion course that explains the rules behind this example you can find a link to it in the description if you have any questions please
