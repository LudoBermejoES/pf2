hello and welcome to how monks played in this video we'll look at the rules and mechanics that are pivotal to playing a monk in Pathfinder second edition remastered and just as a bit of expectation setting here at the start I should mention what this video is not this video does not contain build advice or an overview of all of the abilities that are gained when leveling up as several of them like proficiency increases are not unique to monks the Feats and abilities discussed will focus on the lower levels since this video is intended for newer players and note that this video is not a review of the perceived quality Effectiveness or value of the class but what this video will provide you with are all of the foundational mechanics that make playing a monk different from playing any other class let's start by looking at a few of the abilities and mechanics that are shared among all monks first up is unarmed attacks as martial artist a monk's unarmed attack are more deadly than normal unarmed attacks are made with a part of the body instead of a manufactured weapon this could be your fist heel knee elbow or forehead and they all count as unarmed strikes in addition unarmed strikes could include things like claws biting or swiping with a tail some ancestries even offer ranged unarmed attacks such as the Les's ability to launch seed pods in general all unarmed attacks are treated as using a fist per the table on page 277 of player Core 1 even if within the narrative you describe the attack as a kick or headbutt they deal one4 bling damage belong to the brawling group and have the agile finesse non-lethal and unarmed traits of note here is the non-lethal trait by default unarmed attacks cannot kill a Target unless the attacker wishes to make their attacks lethal which imposes a negative to circumstance penalty to attack rolls special unarmed attacks such as those provided by certain ancestries modify these rules as listed in each entry for example razor tooth goblins gain a bite attack the attack bonus for this is calculated the same as any other unarmed attack but it deals 1d6 piercing damage and only has the Finesse in unarmed traits meaning this bite attack lacks the agile and non-lethal traits that normal unarmed attacks have and it's important to note that since this bite is still an unarmed attack any bonuses or penalties that apply to unarmed attacks apply to biting the same as they would to punching so those are the normal rules for unarmed attacks but what makes monks special is their powerful fist ability when monks make unarmed attacks they do not suffer the -2 penalty for making lethal attacks and the Damage die for basic unarm armed attacks increases from 1 D4 to 1d6 as a monk levels up their unarmed attacks become increasingly more powerful too at third level monks gain the Mystic strikes ability that allows their unarmed attacks to overcome resistances to non-magical attacks at fifth level the expert strength ability grants critical specialization for unarmed attacks in the brawling group meaning when a monk makes an unarmed strike and scores a critical hit the target must succeed at a fortitude save or be slowed one at seventh level monks gain a weapon specialization that increases the damage of their unarmed strikes and this bonus is further increased at 15th level at Ninth level monks gain the metal strikes ability that treats their unarmed attacks as if they were made of cold iron or silver meaning these attacks trigger weaknesses to those Metals in certain creatures like demons devils and Fay and monks gain adamantine strikes that treats their unarmed attacks as if they were made of adamantine meaning they overcome resistances such as the gargoyle's resistance to all physical damage except adamantine and it may be worth noting that normal adamantine weapons reduce the hardness of objects they strike by half as long as the object's hardness is not more than the weapon's hardness but unarmed attacks do not have a hardness so monks do not receive this bonus from the Adam maintain strikes ability however they can take the shattering strike feet at 16th level to gain this so that's the general information you'll need to know about unarmed strikes next let's look at the monks trademark ability Flurry of Blows this allows monks to make two unarmed strikes at the cost of only one action the multiple attack penalty applies to these strikes normally meaning there is no penalty for the first strike assuming the monk has not already made an attack this round but the multiple attack penalty will apply for the second strike with Flur of blows these strikes can Target any enemies within range so they can apply to two different creatures but if the monk decides to use both strikes on the same enemy and they both hit you combine the damages of both strikes together for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses and also note that FL of Blu has the flourish trait meaning it can only be used once per turn let's take a look at a few examples and our first example San the monk is using floral blows to punch a goblin twice this costus his first action of the turn the first strike is made with no multiple attack penalty and the second is made with a -4 multiple attack penalty -4 instead of neg5 because fist attacks have the agile trait if he wanted to continue making unarmed attacks with his second and third actions this turn those attacks would be made with a ne8 penalty now let's say this Goblin San is fighting is a monk to and has the razor tooth Heritage on its turn the goblin uses Flurry of Blows spins one action and attacks San twice the first strike is an unarmed fist attack and the second is a bite attack the first strike is made with no multiple attack penalty but the second is made with a -5 penalty instead of -4 because their bite attack does not have the agile trait so they would have been better off leading with their bite in our third example San is fighting two ugal or faceless stalkers he could decide to use Flor a blows to attack the same ugal twice or each of them once let's say he decides to divide his attacks he would make a strike against the First ugal with no penalty and then strike the second ugal with a -4 multiple attack penalty we'll say both are hits so next he rolls his damage for each strike separately he deals six points of damage to the first one and eight points of damage to the second but since ugal have resistance five to blending damage this resistance is applied to both strikes separately meaning San deals only one point of damage to the first enemy and three points of damage to the second but if he had decided to only attack one of them and succeeded on both strikes then the damage would have been combined for the purposes of overcoming resistances in that case you would add the six damage from the first strike to the eight damage of the second strike for a total of 14 and then track the five resistance to boning only once and that Target would suffer a total of nine points of damage instead of only three and next let's take that same example but instead of ugal that are resistant to bling damage San is fighting a pair of necr fidus who are weak to bludgeoning damage if he chooses to attack one of them with both of his strikes the damage of both attacks will be added together for a total of 14 and then the necroid his weakness to blending damage will be triggered once for a total of 19 damage but if he chooses to divide the attacks and strike each of the enemies once the first will suffer six damage plus five more for the weakness totaling 11 damage and the second will suffer eight damage plus five more for the weakness for a total of 13 damage one of the concerns often raised about Flur of blows is it doesn't seem any different from just making two attacks since the multiple attack penalty still applies but the true benefit of fluid blows is that it only takes one action which leaves one or two actions each turn that can be applied to other things like movement and Mobility is another area where monks really shine starting at third level monks enjoy an increase to their speed score whenever they're not wearing armor this starts as a plus 10 bonus to speed and increases by a additional 5 ft at 7th 11th 15th and 19th level for a final bonus of plus 30 ft so a typical strategy for monks especially at low levels might be to spend their first action to move into melee distance use Flor of blows to attack twice and then their third action to move away after third level the monk likely has a higher speed score than most enemies meaning those enemies will have to spend two of their actions to move into melee against the monk leaving them with only one action left to strike and if the enemy has a ranged weapon the mon can use their extra speed to move into cover that otherwise might be too far to reach with one action yes if the enemy has reactive strike or other abilities that trigger on enemy movement this would trigger it but remember unlike some other popular D20 based RPGs in Pathfinder not everyone has the ability to perform reactive strikes or what you might call Opportunity attacks but if you want to feel extra safe you can take the guarded movement feet at fourth level that grants a plus4 bonus to Armor class against reactions that trigger on your Movement Like reactive strikes so those are the abilities that are Universal to all monks but unlike some other classes monks do not have a form of broad grouping of abilities to choose from like how a cleric chooses their Doctrine a druid chooses their order or a rogue chooses their racket in other games you might call these subclasses but whatever you want to call them monks do not have those instead all monks have the previously mentioned features and then each player can customize their monk by choosing Feats and a lot of these feet options are going to fall into one of three categories which are stances monastic weapons and key spells first let's take a look at stances monks can learn several different combat stances Each of which have their own benefits but they all work the same way unless otherwise stated it costs one action to enter a stance and once you in that stance it persists turn after turn until you are either knocked out you violate any of its prerequisites the encounter ends or or you use the dismiss action which costs one action you can also switch between stances by spending an action but you can only enter a new stance once per round let's take a look at a couple stances available at first level Dragon stance and Mountain stance as long as a monk is not wearing armor they may spend one action to enter dragon stance while in The Stance they can choose to make unarmed attacks as normal or they can make special dragon tail attacks that deal 1 d10 damage and have the back swing trait meaning when you miss with a dragon tail attack you gain a plus one circumstance bonus made with your next dragon tail attack before the end of the turn also while in The Stance you ignore the first square of difficult terrain for comparison let's also look at Mountain stance it also costs one action to enter The Stance and can only be used while wearing armor and while touching the ground while in this stance the only strikes a monk can make are falling Stone unarmed attacks which have the forceful non-lethal and unarmed traits the forceful trait means the more times you use the attack in the same round the more damage it does starting with the second attack gaining a damage bonus equal to the number of damag dice being rolled and that bonus is doubled for the the third attack and more note that you do not need to hit with these attacks to gain the benefits of the forceful trait you only need to attack also while in this stance monks enjoy a plus4 item bonus to Armor class and a plus two circumstance bonus against being repositioned shoved or tripped and this Armor class bonus does stack with the armor class bonus provided by explores clothing bands of force and Mystic armor spell on the downside while in this stance the Monk's speed score is reduced by five and they don't receive any dexterity bonus to their Armor class meaning if the Monk's dexterity modifier is already four or higher this stance will not increase their Armor class however the dexterity cap can be increased by one with the mountain stronghold feet available at six level and further increased to two with the mountain Quake feet at 14th level let's illustrate how these stances work with an example San is fighting an enemy soldier and this is the first round of combat so he's not already in a stance he uses his first action to enter dragon stance and then uses Floria blows with his second action he makes a dragon tail attack as the first strike with no multiple attack penalty and what he does with his second attack is going to depend on if that first first attack hits or not if that attack hits he might want to make a normal unarmed attack with the second strike since it will be made at a ne4 penalty whereas another dragon tail strike would be made at a neg5 penalty because it lacks the agile trait but if he misses with the first dragon tail attack he definitely want to make another dragon tail attack with the second strike of Flor of blows since the plus one gained from the back swing trait would yield a final ne4 penalty just like with normal unarmed attacks with regard to his third action San has some options including making another attack at the maximum multiple attack penalty moving away making a Recon knowledge check and more but one thing he absolutely cannot do with his third action is activate Mountain stance in preparation of the soldier attacking him back stances are limited so that players may only enter a new stance once per round so since San used his first action on this round to enter dragon stance he can't spend his third action to enter Mountain stance and increase his AC and it may also be worth noting that you may only enter a stance while in encounter mode you couldn't for example enter The Stance while in Exploration mode in anticipation of an encounter you would have to wait until after initiative is rolled and on your first turn in that combat encounter before you enter any stances those are the basics of how stances work but there is one more stance worth mentioning here monastic Archer stance allows a monk to use a bow with Flurry of Blows as with the other stances we've looked at it takes one action to enter a monastic Archer stance and while in The Stance the only strikes a monk can make are with bows they cannot make their usual unarmed melee attacks or swing their bow like a melee weapon but they can fire their bow twice with Flurry of Blows and use their bow for any monk ability or feat that normally calls for an unarmed attack unless it specifies a specific strike this may only be done when attacking within half of the first range increment so what this means is any ability that has the monk trait and includes the text make an unarmed strike can be delivered at range with a bow while in this stance this includes things like one- inch punch knockback strike disrupt key and shattering strike as well as key spells such as inner upheaval and while we're on the topic of weapons we should discuss the monastic Weaponry feet this isn't a stance but is an optional first level feat that expands the types of weapons a monk can use by default monks are only proficient with simple weapons and unarmed attacks the monastic Weaponry feat grants trained proficiency with simple and Marshall monk weapons and proficiency with these weapons increases whenever the Monk's unarmed attack proficiency increases in addition any agile or finesse weapons you have access to from a familiarity feat also gain the monk trait and you can use these weapons to deliver monk abilities just like with monastic Archer stance the only main difference being you don't have to be in a stance to benefit from the monastic Weaponry feat you could for example deliver a 1-in punch with a fighting fan or perform a knockback strike with a bow staff in addition to stances and monastic Weaponry the third optional path for monks is key spells key spells is a first level monk Fe that allows the monk to harness their inner Life Force to produce magical effects in the form of focus spells when you take this feat you first need to decide if your key spells will be divine or occult and you gain trained proficiency with those spell attacks and spell DCS wisdom is used as the ability modifier when calculating these you also gain one Focus point that can be spent and replenished as normal for Focus points and as part of this feat you get to choose one first rank key spell such as inner upheaval this spell costs one action and one Focus point to cast the spell and let you make one unarmed attack or FL of blows with a plus one status bonus to attack rolls and an additional 1d6 to damage rolls that is of a damage type of you're choosing between force Spirit vitality and void and just like with all Focus spells key spells automatically heighten to half your level rounded up this feat can be taken multiple times to gain access to multiple first rank key Spells at sixth level monks can take the advanced key spells feet that grants access to third rank key spells master key Spells at 16th level grants access to eighth rank key spells and Grandmaster key spells grants access to ninth rank key spells in addition several Feats like Harmon self Grant access to specific key spells and others like clinging Shadows initiate Grant key spells that provide new stances as well and there are a few other Feats of note but as mentioned before this video is for newer players so we'll only be focusing on the lower levels first flurry of Maneuvers available at fourth level allows you to substitute one or both of the Flur of blow those attacks with grapples repositions shoves or trips but remember all of these Maneuvers have the attack trait meaning they receive and apply the multiple attack penalty just like with normal strikes so if you use the second strike of Flur of blows for one of these Maneuvers it will be rolled with a ne5 penalty as normal one staple of fantasy martial arts is swatting arrows out of the air this is accomplished with the deflect projectile feet that allows a mon to spend their reaction to gain a plus4 bonus to armor class against a physical ranged attack note that the trigger here is when you are the target of the attack meaning this reaction must be declared before dice are rolled and success or failure is announced monks don't get reactive strikes like some other Marshall classes but they can take the stand still feet to gain a similar reaction it works in much the same way as reactive strike except it doesn't trigger on manipulate actions or arranged attacks and instead of disrupting manipulate attacks like casting a spell stand still disrupts movement meaning if an enemy tries to use the stri action to run away you can spend your reaction to make a melee strike and if that strike is a critical hit the stride is disrupted and the enemy remains standing adjacent to you and another feat we'll mention is 1in punch which allows you to gain additional damage dice at the cost of spending two or three actions for the strike two actions adds one die and three actions adds two and this number of additional dice increases at 10th and 18th level those are the general basics for the mechanics at play with monks but we should also discuss gear especially since by default monks avoid wearing armor and have limited access to weapons one common question that comes up is how does a monk keep Pace with other classes when they have no armor and no weapons to attach runes to and the simple answer is that they do have ways to use runes just like these other classes the first piece of gear that most monks will want is a set of Explorer clothing Explorer clothing is technically not armor but can be with armor runes that don't specify an armor category for example a monk can etch a suit of Explorer clothing with a plus one armor potency Rune a resilient Rune and a size changing Rune making it plus one resilient size changing Explorer's clothing just like it was regular armor but the monk wearing it is still considered to be unarmored so they can use stances and other abilities that require you to be unarmed armored but remember the one restriction that explores clothing is not considered to be any kind of armor for example it does not belong to the light armor group and therefore you cannot place any runes on it that require a light armor or medium or heavy armor for that matter for example you cannot place a shadow Rune on Explorer's clothing and the second piece of gear worth mentioning is hand wraps of Mighty blows these do for the monks offense what explorer clothing does for defense so as you might expect hand wraps of Mighty blows work basically the same way allowing you to etch weapon fundamental and property runes to them to enhance your unarmed attacks this allows a monk's attack and damage with unarmed attacks to progress along with other weapon wielding characters but there are two points to keep in mind first these hand WS modify all unarmed attacks not just punches for fist attacks they also modify kicks bite attacks tail swipes and any other attack that has the unarmed trait and yes this does include a lesi cactus spines and their arranged SE pod attacks as well for example an orc with the Tusk feet and wearing plus one striking holy hand wraps of Mighty blows receives a plus one item bonus to attack rolls and extra damage damage die and an additional 1 D4 Spirit damage or 2 D4 to Unholy targets with all unarmed attacks including again punches kicks and yes their Tusk attacks and the second thing to keep in mind with runes and hand wraps is you can etch them with property runes that normally are restricted to certain damaged types other than bludgeoning but they only function when making unarmed attacks that deal that damage type for example Keen runes require the weapon they're attached to to deal piercing or slashing damage but normal unarmed attacks deal beding damage if this was a hammer you wouldn't be able to place a keen run on it but hand wraps work differently you can etch a keen Rune on them or any similar Rune but they only provide their bonus when dealing that kind of damage for example when a monk enters tiger stance and slashing damage with their unarmed attacks so there you
