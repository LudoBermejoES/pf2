hey everybody Dave here with another Pathfinder rule reminder for you and today we're going to be talking about gambling in Pathfinder this was a question that recently came up of how do you make gambling work in a tabletop RPG are there rules in place to ensure that the players don't just completely break everything by winning billions and billions of of gold coins and how would you manage players who want to either uh play into the character trait of being a gambler like a a Lando calisan Fantasy character type or how would you handle characters who want to do like a a um an Oceans 11 style heist with uh casino games so we're going to talk about a couple of those pieces um primarily we're going to be talking about uh the gambling activity itself and you can probably take these pointers and ideas and craft them into a larger story if that's what you want so there are a couple different ways to manage a player gambling in your game and each of them kind of have their own uh strengths and weaknesses and we'll talk through um each of these in turn the first is just going to be your regular earn income activity this is a downtime activity where on on days where there's no adventuring going on you can give your players the opportunity to do a downtime activity and for some people that could mean I'm going to go craft for some people that could mean I'm going to go work in the Local Tavern and for some players that could be uh I want to go to the local casino and see if I can make some money and gambling as an earn income Activity Works exactly the same way as any other earn income activity the only difference is going to be in the narrative however you describe it occurring but it's going to be uh an entire day or roughly 8ish hours of activity in the casino and it comes down to one di roll and that di roll will determine how much of a profit is generated by that character in their gambling activities for that day of downtime they will need to use an appropriate lore skill to do this most likely either Casino lore or game lore and um if you want detailed information of how that works I'll make sure I link in the comments section or the description of this video uh my previous videos on the earn income activity that really goes through the nuts and bolts of how earn income Works uh I will mention that uh there is a spell that was released I think in secrets of magic called nudge the odds and the nudge the odds spell allows a person to get a plus one bonus to their games lore roles for one hour and it turns any critical failures into regular failures so uh the base version cannot be used with um with earn income because it only has a 1hour duration but if you increase it to fifth level I believe it becomes an all day activity and you specifically can use it as part of your downtime activities now on the downside of using this spell is one facial feature determined by the GM is turned golden for the duration of the spell so uh this is a pretty clear tell that uh you are using some sort of magic to enhance your abilities uh whether or not the people in the casino can recognize it will will determine will come down to a recall knowledge check on their end uh but just be aware that there uh there is the danger of getting busted pretty easily using uh the um uh nudge the odds spell so um that is the first op earn income a benefits super simple it comes down to one die roll uh it's earn income activity it uh inherently does not require a lot of time at the game table you can knock it out at the same time everybody else is doing their crafting or their uh their retraining or whatever their downtime activities are um the the downside of it is it comes down to one di roll so if you have a player that's really wanting to invest or if you're trying to craft a meaningful narrative that revolves around gambling and and games of chance then it's probably not going to be uh super fulfilling for them but that kind of leads us to our second option which is uh book three of the Agents of edge Watch Adventure path called All or Nothing uh has in its back matter or in its Adventure toolbox I think they call it a number of different uh realworld gambling games chance converted into the Pathfinder setting that you can play out at the game table uh now the plus side is that these are much more immersive experiences than uh just an earn income role um the downside is is your players are going to be playing this for real using their own Noggin and their own abilities uh not their characters so one thing in common with these uh I think is three from All or Nothing I'll be sharing in a second is none of them interact with character sheets so none of them interact with games Lords of skill interact with Casino lore uh would be uh impacted or interact with uh the nudge the odd spell you are you are playing these games for real so to speak at your game table um but with the characters money and their ability to profit from it also I'll mention that all three of these games are available on Archives of nethys um and I will include links to those writeups in the description of this video um in case you don't have the um old or nothing Adventure so the first is a game called Gollum and golum is sort of like the Pathfinders version of Poker uh the idea is that you have a number of players sitting around the table and there's a dealer and those players are trying to build the best poker hand out of their cards um now I'll I'll say that um the writeup doesn't tell you the rules of Poker I think it just references poker and says like you know to determine who has the winning hand is the same rules as poker so you might need to go to Wikipedia or some other resource online to find out you know when a full house beats a straight flush and all those kind of rules but it's going to use those familiar rules uh the game is played in rounds uh anti is usually capped at five gold um Everybody matches the current bet or the anti and then they can either raise or fold just kind of like in poker where you go in rounds betting continues until all players have matched the current bet or they have folded and then each player May discard up to two of their cards and draw two new cards so everybody still in the game if they've if they've matched the uh the current bet for that round they can discard zero one or two of their cards and then draw in new ones uh those cards are going to be placed face down on the table so none of the other players can see what was discarded and those cards now all belong to the Golem essentially the dealer at the table is going to take all those cards and keep them and they are the Golem and those cars now belong to the Golem uh if everybody folds except for one player that player wins the pot minus 5% that goes to the house uh in Golem the house always gets 5% of the pot uh no matter what the outcomes are if at least two players match that bet at the end of the round then the dealer frees the Golem and then the Golem is going to flip over all of their cards and make the best possible poker hand that they can out of all of the cards that were discarded by the players who are in that round and if the if one of the players um has the best hand to Beast the other players and the Golem then that player uh wins the pot minus 5% that always goes to the house and if no player beats the Golem then uh you start over again you're going to to double the size of the current ante and start over again and you keep playing until every round if nobody beats the goem we start again and double it and double it double it and um at the or it's going to end when one player eventually beats the Golem and they get whatever is in that pot minus the 5% that goes to the house so that's Golem which is kind of basically like poker the second game um from All or Nothing is called Bounder which I believe is kind of like craps I should probably confess that I'm not a gambler so I I may be I may be wrong uh let me know in the comments if I'm goofing it up I think this is supposed to be like craps this is played with uh a bunch of gamblers standing around a table throwing Dice and each of them goes in turns uh there is a shooter and that's whose ever turn it is and then there is a dealer so Shooters are going to roll 2D2 and the dealer is going to roll 3d6 and the the goal is if you're the shooter you want to bound the total of the dealers 3d6 and bounding means one of your D20 numbers is lower than the Dealer's 3d6 total and your other D20 is higher than the 3d6 total from the dealer so you're on either side on either bounds you're bounding the um the dealers 3d6 total so the way this is going to work in turn is whoever is the shooter is going to roll one D20 only one of their two dice rolled first and whatever that total is is called the point at that point the shooter can choose to double their stake double their bet based on their first D20 result so if if they throw that first die and it's a a one a two a 19 or a 20 then they know they're going to have at least one di on one side of the 3d6 because one 12 19 and 20 are not possible totals for 3d6 so there they're going to say yeah automatically I'm going to double my my my stake um and they can also D choose a double it I mean if if they roll a five they might choose to double it because still odds are good but so on and so forth they get the opportunity to double it if if they if they roll a nine on that one20 they probably don't want to risk doubling their uh their stake um at that point all the other gamblers who are not the shooter on the table can choose whether or not they want to bet on the final result so they can throw in a stake and say I think uh the shooter is going to win based on this first role on this point I think they're going to win they're going to bound the dealers roles so I'm going to throw 10 gold into the pot or whatever at that point the dealer is going to roll their 3d6 now it says it varies from gambling location to location but some casinos before the dealer rolls their 3d6 will allow all the gamblers at the table to place bets on what the the 3d6 total is going to be or actually not the total but you can make a side bet and say I think the dealer is going to roll all odd numbers or I think they're going to roll all even numbers or I think they're going to roll three of a kind and um if you bet that they're going to roll all odd or all even you get uh you get basically double back you get the same amount as what you staked and in profit and if you bet that there are going to roll three of a kind you uh get tripled now uh let me I'm going to give me one second check here because I have on my form here the odds yeah the odds of the dealer rolling all evens or odds on 3d6 is less than a 133% chance and the odds of rolling three of a kind is less than 3% so these sound like pretty bad bets to me but um but that is something that is an option when playing Bounder so then um the dealer rolls there 3d6 you see the total and uh from there if if the total is equal to the first 1 D20 that the that the shooter rolled then the shooter automatically loses and everybody loses their stake on that um in order to win boundary you have to have one lower than and one higher than any die that equals the total of the dealer automatically lose loses and then the shooter is going to roll their other D20 and see if they win if they end up with having one of their D20 results being lower than the dealers 3d6 total and one Higher they're going to uh get a they're going to win an amount equal to their stake and if uh if if any other scenario happens either they tie or both numbers are lower but the numbers are higher then they lose their their stake uh this the odds of this it says is about 40% the shooter should win about 40% of the time and after one person plays as the shooter then you just go like clockwise around the table and the next Gambler gets their chance to be the shooter and it just repeats and repeats for as long as people want to play and have fun so that brings us to our third um casino game our game of chance from um the all or nothing book for agents of edge watch and that's a game called Century which I believe is like Kino um and this is kind of just like a lottery so basically what happens is the house is going to be randomly generating 20 numbers and those numbers are going to be between one and 100 and you can choose to uh bet between two and 10 times so you can you can choose choose two numbers between one and 100 or you can choose 10 numbers between one and 100 or anywhere between there and for every number that you pick that is that is drawn or rolled by the house then you're going to win uh an amount of money and uh if you don't then you lose your money so it it is basically just a lottery system as far as I can tell uh there is a handy chart that's in the book that shows you the amount of money that is W uh if you correctly guess the numbers so for example we can see on this chart if you uh predicted two numbers and you got one of those right you're going to win times one which basically just means you're breaking even they're going to give you back the money that you bet uh if you if you made seven predictions or you know you chose like seven lottery numbers if that's an easier way to think of it and a four of those came correct you're going to get to double your your money back if you made 10 predictions and you got six of those 10 rights you're going to get 20 uh times your your stake back so it's it's purely a lottery you're basically guessing numbers and and then the GM who's playing the the house will roll 1D 10020 times and that's how we generate our numbers and if you correctly predict a certain number of those um of those 1D 100 rolls then you are potentially going to get a payout um if you made 10 predictions and got four of them right you're going to get nothing if you do 10 predictions you got to get at least half of those right out of the out of one to 100 um so unsurprisingly the odds are always going to be in The house's favor so that is basically how Kino works so we have our first option is earn income super simple super easy um it interacts with your character's skills but it's not super immersive second option take one of those three games out of all or nothing they are very immersive but they're also timec consuming and they don't interact at all with your character sheet it's entirely based on what you as a human being as a player choose to do the last option is kind of a happy middle ground between the two but it's definitely going to take some work on your end as a GM and that is just to use the victory point system out of the game mastery guide or out of GM core um build your own um game using the rules for the victory point system where your players can do skill checks in a gaming environment with the potential of earning victory points and then set a a certain amount of payout at the end of the games based on how many victory points they earn uh I'm not going to dive deeper than that at this time um I may make a a true Deep dive video about victory points in the future but um that is a third option that's kind of a happy middle ground between all of these options so that's it for today if you have any questions about uh these gambling rules in Pathfinder please let me know in the comments below also this is the kind of thing that I imagine GMS and games have been doing for a while now so if you have your own tips your own games the way that you've used games lore or Casino lore in the past to generate uh income or to generate a a gaming
