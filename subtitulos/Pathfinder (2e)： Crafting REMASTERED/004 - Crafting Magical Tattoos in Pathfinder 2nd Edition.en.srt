much assume at least for now that this
 

53
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,830
much assume at least for now that this
is the way that they work uh in the

54
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840
is the way that they work uh in the
 

55
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,310
is the way that they work uh in the
remaster version as well unless at some

56
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
remaster version as well unless at some
 

57
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,270
remaster version as well unless at some
point they do go back and make a

58
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,280
point they do go back and make a
 

59
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,310
point they do go back and make a
specific change to to state otherwise so

60
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320

83
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,990
like permanent worn items and as such
they do need to be invested however the

84
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,000
they do need to be invested however the
 

85
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,749
they do need to be invested however the
mechanism for investing them is a little

86
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
mechanism for investing them is a little
 

87
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,789
mechanism for investing them is a little
different um mechanically speaking what

88
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
different um mechanically speaking what
 

89
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,109
different um mechanically speaking what
they do is they look lower the maximum

90
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
