00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,240
specifically by you for example if
 

329
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,510
specifically by you for example if
you're crafting a painting or other work

330
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
you're crafting a painting or other work
 

331
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,629
you're crafting a painting or other work
of art your second option after rolling

332
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
of art your second option after rolling
 

333
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,110
of art your second option after rolling
a success is to invest more time in

334
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
a success is to invest more time in
 

335
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,029
a success is to invest more time in
crafting it every day of additional work

336
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:14,039
crafting it every day of additional work
 

337
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,390
crafting it every day of additional work
lowers the amount of resources needed to

338
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
lowers the amount of resources needed to
 

339
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,230
lowers the amount of resources needed to
complete the item by an amount equal to

340
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,240
complete the item by an amount equal to
 

341
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,869
complete the item by an amount equal to
the table found on page

342
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:21,879
the table found on page
 

343
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,070
the table found on page
229 so for example if you were eighth

344
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,080
229 so for example if you were eighth
 

345
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,950
229 so for example if you were eighth
level with expert Proficiency in

346
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
level with expert Proficiency in
 

347
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,390
level with expert Proficiency in
crafting every additional day of

348
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400
crafting every additional day of
 

349
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,869
crafting every additional day of
downtime spent beyond what is required

350
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:31,879
downtime spent beyond what is required
 

351
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,029
downtime spent beyond what is required
would lower the needed resources to

352
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:34,039
would lower the needed resources to
 

353
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,029
would lower the needed resources to
complete the item by three gold pieces

354
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
complete the item by three gold pieces
 

355
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,309
complete the item by three gold pieces
and if you roll a critical success you

356
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:39,319
and if you roll a critical success you
 

357
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,430
and if you roll a critical success you
treat yourself as being one level higher

358
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:42,440
treat yourself as being one level higher
 

359
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,670
treat yourself as being one level higher
so if you're again an eighth level

360
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
so if you're again an eighth level
 

361
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,629
so if you're again an eighth level
expert and roll a critical success you

362

expert and roll a critical success you
 

363
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,430
expert and roll a critical success you
would lower the amount of resources

364
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
would lower the amount of resources
 

365
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,510
would lower the amount of resources
needed by four gold instead of three for

on the item after each day of work you
 

371
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,230
on the item after each day of work you

is just a matter of counting days and
 

389
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,110
is just a matter of counting days and

do you really need to spend an entire
 

401
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,430
do you really need to spend an entire

403
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,110
day to make a single Arrow the good news
is no you don't it's not quite that bad

404
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,120
is no you don't it's not quite that bad
 

405
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,750
is no you don't it's not quite that bad
if you wish to craft ammunition or any

406
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:40,760
if you wish to craft ammunition or any
 

407
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,310
if you wish to craft ammunition or any
item with the consumable trait you can

408
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,320
item with the consumable trait you can
 

409
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,269
item with the consumable trait you can
make those in batches non-magical

410
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:46,279
make those in batches non-magical
 

411
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,790
make those in batches non-magical
ammunition is created in batches equal

412
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
ammunition is created in batches equal
 

413
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,430
ammunition is created in batches equal
to their numberers shown on page 281 so

414
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,440
to their numberers shown on page 281 so
 

415
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,470
to their numberers shown on page 281 so
blow gun darts crossbow bolts and arrows

416
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,480
blow gun darts crossbow bolts and arrows
 

417
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,550
blow gun darts crossbow bolts and arrows
are all made in batches of 10 and all

418
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
are all made in batches of 10 and all
 

419
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,750
are all made in batches of 10 and all
other items with the consumable trait

420
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:00,760
other items with the consumable trait
 

421
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,350
other items with the consumable trait
including magical ammunition are made in

422
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
including magical ammunition are made in
 

423
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,430
including magical ammunition are made in
batches of four when you create by batch

424
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
batches of four when you create by batch
 

425
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,750
batches of four when you create by batch
every item in that batch must be

426
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
every item in that batch must be
 

427
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,190
every item in that batch must be
identical there's no mixing and matching

428
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:12,200
identical there's no mixing and matching
 

429
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,150
identical there's no mixing and matching
so you can't make Five Arrows In five

430
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,160
so you can't make Five Arrows In five
 

431
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,949
so you can't make Five Arrows In five
crossbow bolts in the same batch it has

432
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:17,959
crossbow bolts in the same batch it has
 

433
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,990
crossbow bolts in the same batch it has
to be 10 of one or 10 of the other

434
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,000
to be 10 of one or 10 of the other
 

435
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,949
to be 10 of one or 10 of the other
crafting in batches works the same way

436
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
crafting in batches works the same way
 

437
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,710
crafting in batches works the same way
as crafting individual items except you

438
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:25,720
as crafting individual items except you
 

439
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,470
as crafting individual items except you
add the price of each item together so

440
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
add the price of each item together so
 

441
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,790
add the price of each item together so
if you're making a batch of four vials

442
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
if you're making a batch of four vials
 

443
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,150
if you're making a batch of four vials
of holy water the price would be 12 gold

444
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
of holy water the price would be 12 gold
 

445
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,110
of holy water the price would be 12 gold
and you would need to provide six gold

446
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,120
and you would need to provide six gold
 

447
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,470
and you would need to provide six gold
up front for the material cost other

448
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
up front for the material cost other
 

449
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,150
up front for the material cost other
than that crafting in batches works the
