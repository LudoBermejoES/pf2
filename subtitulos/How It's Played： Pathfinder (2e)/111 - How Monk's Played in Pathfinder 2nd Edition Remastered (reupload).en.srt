each strike separately he deals six

336

each strike separately he deals six
 

337
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,350
each strike separately he deals six
points of damage to the first one and

338
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
points of damage to the first one and
 

339
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,510
points of damage to the first one and
eight points of damage to the second but

eight points of damage to the second but
 

341
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,909
eight points of damage to the second but
since ugal have resistance five to

since ugal have resistance five to
 

343
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,629
since ugal have resistance five to
blending damage this resistance is

blending damage this resistance is
 

345
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,510
blending damage this resistance is
applied to both strikes separately

applied to both strikes separately
 

347
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,270

meaning San deals only one point of

had decided to only attack one of them
and succeeded on both strikes then the

00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
and succeeded on both strikes then the
 

357
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,909
and succeeded on both strikes then the
damage would have been combined for the

resistances in that case you would add

resistances in that case you would add
 

363
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,270
resistances in that case you would add
the six damage from the first strike to

364
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,280
the six damage from the first strike to
 

365
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,510
the six damage from the first strike to
the eight damage of the second strike

366
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:56,520
the eight damage of the second strike
 

367
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,950
the eight damage of the second strike
for a total of 14 and then track the

368
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
for a total of 14 and then track the
 

369
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,189

five resistance to boning only once and

00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
five resistance to boning only once and
 

371
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,390
five resistance to boning only once and
that Target would suffer a total of nine
