the forced movement for example the text
 

167
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,350
the forced movement for example the text
for the hydraulic push spell says on a

for the hydraulic push spell says on a
success the target is pushed by 5T and

in this case for two reasons first

in this case for two reasons first
 

213
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,790
in this case for two reasons first
because this is a forced movement which

214
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
because this is a forced movement which
 

215
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,710
because this is a forced movement which
does not trigger reactions due to

does not trigger reactions due to
 

217
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,870
does not trigger reactions due to
movement and second because the text for

218
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:45,880
movement and second because the text for
 

219
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,189
movement and second because the text for
reactive strike specifically states that

220
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:48,199
reactive strike specifically states that
 

221
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,189
reactive strike specifically states that
the target must spend their own action

the target must spend their own action

question of what happens when you shove

00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,629
question of what happens when you shove
one enemy in into another the rules say

one enemy in into another the rules say

one enemy in into another the rules say
that no two creatures can occupy the

that no two creatures can occupy the
