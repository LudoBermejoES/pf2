rules for Starfinder second edition,
 

45
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,510
rules for Starfinder second edition,
which heavily use the hazard rules and

46
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
which heavily use the hazard rules and
 

47
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,709
which heavily use the hazard rules and
some questions I've received

48
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
some questions I've received
 

49
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,350
some questions I've received
specifically specifically about haunts,

50
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
specifically specifically about haunts,
 

51
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,189
specifically specifically about haunts,
uh I figured it'd make sense just to do

52
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
uh I figured it'd make sense just to do
 

53
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,549
uh I figured it'd make sense just to do
one of these quick little videos to talk

54
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
one of these quick little videos to talk
 

55
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,470
one of these quick little videos to talk
about it. Specifically, I was asked if I

56
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
about it. Specifically, I was asked if I
 

57
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,630
about it. Specifically, I was asked if I
could take a haunt and just kind of walk

58
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
could take a haunt and just kind of walk
 

59
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,670
could take a haunt and just kind of walk
through it from A to Z. you know, how it

60
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
through it from A to Z. you know, how it
 

61
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,590
through it from A to Z. you know, how it
works, what's in the stat block, how it

62
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
works, what's in the stat block, how it
 

63
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,230
works, what's in the stat block, how it
would be presented in a a game, and how

64
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
would be presented in a a game, and how
 

65
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,510
would be presented in a a game, and how
things might play out. So, um, before we

66
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
things might play out. So, um, before we
 

67
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,429
things might play out. So, um, before we
get too deep into haunts, we should

68
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
get too deep into haunts, we should
 

69
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,710
get too deep into haunts, we should
probably just talk about hazards in

70
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
probably just talk about hazards in
 

71
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,789
probably just talk about hazards in
general. Ha, a haunt is a specific kind

72
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
general. Ha, a haunt is a specific kind
 

73
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,149
general. Ha, a haunt is a specific kind
of hazard. So, maybe we should cover

74
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
of hazard. So, maybe we should cover
 

75
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,590
of hazard. So, maybe we should cover
what a hazard is first. Uh, a hazard is

76
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
what a hazard is first. Uh, a hazard is
 

77
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,749
what a hazard is first. Uh, a hazard is
basically anything in the game that

78
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
basically anything in the game that
 

79
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,149
basically anything in the game that
would be considered an obstacle or a

80
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
would be considered an obstacle or a
 

81
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,870
would be considered an obstacle or a
danger to the players that is not a

82
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
danger to the players that is not a
 

83
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,710
danger to the players that is not a
creature. So, uh, most of the conflict

84
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
creature. So, uh, most of the conflict
 

85
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,469
creature. So, uh, most of the conflict
traditionally in these games, especially

86
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
traditionally in these games, especially
 

87
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,469
traditionally in these games, especially
in like a dungeon crawl, is going to

88
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
in like a dungeon crawl, is going to
 

89
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,910
in like a dungeon crawl, is going to
come in the form of monsters for the

90
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
come in the form of monsters for the
 

91
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,710
come in the form of monsters for the
players to fight and vanquish. Uh, those

92
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
players to fight and vanquish. Uh, those
 

93
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,710
players to fight and vanquish. Uh, those
are creatures. They use the creature

94
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
are creatures. They use the creature
 

95
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,910
are creatures. They use the creature
rules, the creature combat rules. uh NPC

96
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
rules, the creature combat rules. uh NPC
 

97
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,630
rules, the creature combat rules. uh NPC
interactions would likely use the social

98
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
interactions would likely use the social
 

99
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,149
interactions would likely use the social
encounter rules. So, a hazard is going

100
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
encounter rules. So, a hazard is going
 

101
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,310
encounter rules. So, a hazard is going
to be basically anything other than

102
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
to be basically anything other than
 

103
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,109
to be basically anything other than
those creatures that is an obstacle or a

104
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
those creatures that is an obstacle or a
 

105
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,029
those creatures that is an obstacle or a
danger to the player. Now, I might want

106
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
danger to the player. Now, I might want
 

107
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,229
danger to the player. Now, I might want
to put a little asterk next to that.

108
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
to put a little asterk next to that.
 

109
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,110
to put a little asterk next to that.
There are other systems like uh victory

110
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
There are other systems like uh victory
 

111
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,270
There are other systems like uh victory
point systems, the chase subsystem and

112
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
point systems, the chase subsystem and
 

113
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,070
point systems, the chase subsystem and
so forth that are also used to manage uh

114
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
so forth that are also used to manage uh
 

115
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,550
so forth that are also used to manage uh
difficulties, obstacles, and dangers in

116
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
difficulties, obstacles, and dangers in
 

117
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,630
difficulties, obstacles, and dangers in
the game. but they usually look at

118
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
the game. but they usually look at
 

119
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,030
the game. but they usually look at
things either outside of encounter mode

120
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
things either outside of encounter mode
 

121
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,390
things either outside of encounter mode
or over several rounds of encounters to

122
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
or over several rounds of encounters to
 

123
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,430
or over several rounds of encounters to
accumulate points. Um, but a hazard is

124
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
accumulate points. Um, but a hazard is
 

125
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,869
accumulate points. Um, but a hazard is
going to be something that you deal with

126
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
going to be something that you deal with
 

127
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,229
going to be something that you deal with
in encounter mode uh right along with

128
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
in encounter mode uh right along with
 

129
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,630
in encounter mode uh right along with
battling monsters and everything else.

130
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
battling monsters and everything else.
 

131
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,550
battling monsters and everything else.
So, our our hazards are are going to

132
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
So, our our hazards are are going to
 

133
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,150
So, our our hazards are are going to
fall into basically three broad

134
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
fall into basically three broad
 

135
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,070
fall into basically three broad
categories. The first of those is a

136
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
categories. The first of those is a
 

137
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,509
categories. The first of those is a
trap. uh anything that a person is going

138
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
trap. uh anything that a person is going
 

139
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,430
trap. uh anything that a person is going
to create for I'm creating it tonight

140
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
to create for I'm creating it tonight
 

141
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,110
to create for I'm creating it tonight
right now and it's going to either blow

142
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
right now and it's going to either blow
 

143
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,869
right now and it's going to either blow
up or trigger or activate at a later

144
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
up or trigger or activate at a later
 

145
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,229
up or trigger or activate at a later
time usually to defend uh your house a

146
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
time usually to defend uh your house a
 

147
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,070
time usually to defend uh your house a
dungeon whatever uh a chest from opening

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
dungeon whatever uh a chest from opening
 

149
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,589
dungeon whatever uh a chest from opening
you're probably familiar with traps if

150
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
you're probably familiar with traps if
 

151
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,949
you're probably familiar with traps if
you've ever seen Raiders of the Lost

152
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
you've ever seen Raiders of the Lost
 

153
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,309
you've ever seen Raiders of the Lost
Dark you've seen the opening scene those

154
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
Dark you've seen the opening scene those
 

155
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,509
Dark you've seen the opening scene those
are traps those are hazards uh another

156
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
are traps those are hazards uh another
 

157
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,910
are traps those are hazards uh another
type of broad category of hazards is

158
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
type of broad category of hazards is
 

159
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,149
type of broad category of hazards is
going to be environmental al hazards. Uh

160
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
going to be environmental al hazards. Uh
 

161
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,070
going to be environmental al hazards. Uh

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,670
to be experienced by everybody. Although
a lot of times the uh the opponents in

a lot of times the uh the opponents in
 

181
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,670
a lot of times the uh the opponents in

hazard is. But the third kind of hazard

186
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
hazard is. But the third kind of hazard
 

187
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,550
hazard is. But the third kind of hazard
is the kind we're going to be talking

188
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
is the kind we're going to be talking
 

189
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,589
is the kind we're going to be talking
about primarily today which is a haunt.

190
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
about primarily today which is a haunt.
 

191
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,229
about primarily today which is a haunt.
A haunt is I think of it as especially

192
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
A haunt is I think of it as especially
 

193
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,229
A haunt is I think of it as especially
mechanically speaking is it's like a

194
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
mechanically speaking is it's like a
 

195
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,630
mechanically speaking is it's like a
trap. A haunt is nothing but a spooky

196
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
trap. A haunt is nothing but a spooky
 

197
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,149
trap. A haunt is nothing but a spooky
trap. Right? So the the the only real

198
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
trap. Right? So the the the only real
 

199
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,949
trap. Right? So the the the only real
difference between a haunt spooky trap

200
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
difference between a haunt spooky trap
 

201
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,270
difference between a haunt spooky trap
and a traditional mechanical or magical

202
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
and a traditional mechanical or magical
 

203
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,950
and a traditional mechanical or magical
trap is traps are intentionally created

204
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
trap is traps are intentionally created
 

205
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,710
trap is traps are intentionally created
and they are armed and they are

206
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
and they are armed and they are
 

207
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,550
and they are armed and they are
intentionally placed and so forth. And

208
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
intentionally placed and so forth. And
 

209
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,830
intentionally placed and so forth. And
there's usually something physical about

210
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
there's usually something physical about
 

211
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,070
there's usually something physical about
them. you can interact with them

212
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
them. you can interact with them
 

213
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,870
them. you can interact with them
physically to either disarm them or uh

214
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
physically to either disarm them or uh
 

215
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,670
physically to either disarm them or uh
they're going to have a a physical

216
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
they're going to have a a physical
 

217
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,710
they're going to have a a physical
presence in the room. A haunt is more of

218
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
presence in the room. A haunt is more of
 

219
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,430
presence in the room. A haunt is more of
like the echoes of the dead have tainted

220
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
like the echoes of the dead have tainted
 

221
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,950
like the echoes of the dead have tainted
an area. It's a spectral phenomenon.

222
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
an area. It's a spectral phenomenon.
 

223
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,189
an area. It's a spectral phenomenon.
It's going to be something that is

00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
It's going to be something that is
 

225
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,670
It's going to be something that is
typically not uh immediately dealt with

00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
typically not uh immediately dealt with
 

227
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,469
typically not uh immediately dealt with
in a physical manner. is probably going

228
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
in a physical manner. is probably going
 

229
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,510
in a physical manner. is probably going
to be dealt with using other skills. Uh,

230
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
to be dealt with using other skills. Uh,
 

231
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,510
to be dealt with using other skills. Uh,
in fact, it might be even worth looking

232
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
in fact, it might be even worth looking
 

233
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,310
in fact, it might be even worth looking
at the three different kinds of hazards

234
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
at the three different kinds of hazards
 

235
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,790
at the three different kinds of hazards
by the kinds of skills that are

236
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
by the kinds of skills that are
 

237
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,350
by the kinds of skills that are
typically used to uh to disable them.

238
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
typically used to uh to disable them.
 

239
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,629
typically used to uh to disable them.
Although disable is a mechanical term.

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,189
Although disable is a mechanical term.
Uh, when we're talking about physical

00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
Uh, when we're talking about physical
 

243
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,710
Uh, when we're talking about physical
traps, you're talking about using

traps, you're talking about using
 

245
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,749

survival skill. And like no, that
 

261
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,909

doesn't mean like I disable the entire

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
doesn't mean like I disable the entire

mean by disable in a uh environmental
 

277
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,950
mean by disable in a uh environmental
sense. And your your hunts are typically

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,670
depending on the nature of the hunt.
Sometimes the the haunts are uh based on

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
Sometimes the the haunts are uh based on
 

287
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,070
Sometimes the the haunts are uh based on
sort of undead elements in which case it

288
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
sort of undead elements in which case it
 

289
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,550
sort of undead elements in which case it
would be religion. In others is is like

290
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
would be religion. In others is is like
 

291
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,350
would be religion. In others is is like
the psychic mental anguish of something

292
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
the psychic mental anguish of something
 

293
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,510
the psychic mental anguish of something
and in those cases it might be more a

294
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
and in those cases it might be more a
 

295
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,430
and in those cases it might be more a
cult than it is religion. Um, you also

296
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
cult than it is religion. Um, you also
 

297
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,350
cult than it is religion. Um, you also
might typically use uh diplomacy or even

298
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
might typically use uh diplomacy or even
 

299
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,629
might typically use uh diplomacy or even
intimidate in haunts if there is a

300
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
intimidate in haunts if there is a
 

301
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,390
intimidate in haunts if there is a
spirit that is still conscious in the

302
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
spirit that is still conscious in the
 

303
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,230
spirit that is still conscious in the
area. Uh, using diplomacy to calm them

304
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
area. Uh, using diplomacy to calm them
 

305
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,909
area. Uh, using diplomacy to calm them
might be a way to disable that haunt.

306
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
might be a way to disable that haunt.
 

307
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,430
might be a way to disable that haunt.
And just like all of the hazards, uh,

308
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
And just like all of the hazards, uh,
 

309
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,510
And just like all of the hazards, uh,
haunts come in two varieties. There's

310
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
haunts come in two varieties. There's
 

311
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,749
haunts come in two varieties. There's
there are simple haunts and complex

312
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
there are simple haunts and complex
 

313
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,469
there are simple haunts and complex
haunts. Just like there are simple

314
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
haunts. Just like there are simple
 

315
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,189
haunts. Just like there are simple
traps, complex tracks traps, simple

316
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
traps, complex tracks traps, simple
 

317
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,150
traps, complex tracks traps, simple
hazards, complex hazards. The difference

318
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
hazards, complex hazards. The difference
 

319
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,790
hazards, complex hazards. The difference
between a simple hazard and a complex

320
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
between a simple hazard and a complex
 

321
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,430
between a simple hazard and a complex
one is that a simple hazard is one and

322
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
one is that a simple hazard is one and
 

323
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,870
one is that a simple hazard is one and
done. A simple hazard is a landmine. Uh

324
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
done. A simple hazard is a landmine. Uh
 

325
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,150
done. A simple hazard is a landmine. Uh
uh uh you either detect the the landmine

326
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
uh uh you either detect the the landmine
 

327
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,589
uh uh you either detect the the landmine
and you disable it or you step on it and

328
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
and you disable it or you step on it and
 

329
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,390
and you disable it or you step on it and
it explodes. But once that happens, it's

330
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
it explodes. But once that happens, it's
 

331
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,469
it explodes. But once that happens, it's
done. Uh it doesn't persist round after

332
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
done. Uh it doesn't persist round after
 

333
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,589
done. Uh it doesn't persist round after
round after round and it doesn't uh have

334
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
round after round and it doesn't uh have
 

335
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,909
round after round and it doesn't uh have
its own place in initiative. It operates

336
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
its own place in initiative. It operates
 

337
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,790
its own place in initiative. It operates
on a reaction.

338
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
on a reaction.
 

339
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,150
on a reaction.
But uh complex hazards are ones that are

340
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
But uh complex hazards are ones that are
 

341
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,469
But uh complex hazards are ones that are
typically triggered by a reaction or

342
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
typically triggered by a reaction or
 

343
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,430
typically triggered by a reaction or
possibly a free action with a trigger.

344
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
possibly a free action with a trigger.
 

345
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,830
possibly a free action with a trigger.
Uh the main difference there being that

346
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
Uh the main difference there being that
 

347
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,230
Uh the main difference there being that
if a hazard or a haunt has a reaction in

348
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
if a hazard or a haunt has a reaction in
 

349
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,510
if a hazard or a haunt has a reaction in
a trigger, it's it's one reaction and

350
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
a trigger, it's it's one reaction and
 

351
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,350
a trigger, it's it's one reaction and
then it goes into its uh its routine. If

352
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
then it goes into its uh its routine. If
 

353
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,070
then it goes into its uh its routine. If
it has a if it's triggered by a free

354
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
it has a if it's triggered by a free
 

355
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,309
it has a if it's triggered by a free
action, then free actions are not

356
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
action, then free actions are not
 

357
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,909
action, then free actions are not
limited to only once per turn. So if it

358
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
limited to only once per turn. So if it
 

359
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,670
limited to only once per turn. So if it
has a free action on it, it can do it

360
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
has a free action on it, it can do it
 

361
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,110
has a free action on it, it can do it
over and over and over again. I think

362
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
over and over and over again. I think
 

363
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,270
over and over and over again. I think
the example in the book is a is a

364
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
the example in the book is a is a
 

365
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,550
the example in the book is a is a
environmental hazard of quicksand. Uh

366
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
environmental hazard of quicksand. Uh
 

367
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,469
environmental hazard of quicksand. Uh
quicksand is going to trigger and

368
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
quicksand is going to trigger and
 

369
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,230
quicksand is going to trigger and
swallow as many people that step into

370
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
swallow as many people that step into
 

371
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,029
swallow as many people that step into
it, not just the first person who does.

372
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
it, not just the first person who does.
 

373
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,830
it, not just the first person who does.
So that is an example of why some of

374
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
So that is an example of why some of
 

375
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,230
So that is an example of why some of
these hazards have uh initial triggers

376
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
these hazards have uh initial triggers
 

377
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,749
these hazards have uh initial triggers
that are um free actions instead of

378
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
that are um free actions instead of
 

379
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,950
that are um free actions instead of
reactions. But anyway,

380
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
reactions. But anyway,
 

381
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,350
reactions. But anyway,
a haunt is basically mechanically

382
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
a haunt is basically mechanically
 

383
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,990
a haunt is basically mechanically
speaking going to function the same way

384
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
speaking going to function the same way
 

385
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,949
speaking going to function the same way
as any other hazard. It's best in my

386
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
as any other hazard. It's best in my
 

387
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,909
as any other hazard. It's best in my
mind to think of them as spooky traps.

388
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
mind to think of them as spooky traps.
 

389
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,389
mind to think of them as spooky traps.
And uh that can get a little weird

390
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
And uh that can get a little weird
 

391
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,430
And uh that can get a little weird
because they do have elements that are

392
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
because they do have elements that are
 

393
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,910
because they do have elements that are
similar to creatures. So there could be

394
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
similar to creatures. So there could be
 

395
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,590
similar to creatures. So there could be
a spectral figure or a ghost that's

396
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
a spectral figure or a ghost that's
 

397
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,350
a spectral figure or a ghost that's
involved in the haunt that you have a

398
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
involved in the haunt that you have a
 

399
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,430
involved in the haunt that you have a
conversation with and you diplomacize

400
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
conversation with and you diplomacize
 

401
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,910
conversation with and you diplomacize
with. And there also might be other

402
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
with. And there also might be other
 

403
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,150
with. And there also might be other
situations where that ghost is in the

404
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
situations where that ghost is in the
 

405
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,829
situations where that ghost is in the
game as a creature and not as a hazard.

406
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
game as a creature and not as a hazard.
 

407
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,590
game as a creature and not as a hazard.
Uh I think that the major distinction

408
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
Uh I think that the major distinction
 

409
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,110
Uh I think that the major distinction
between those two is if it's in the if

410
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
between those two is if it's in the if
 

411
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,550
between those two is if it's in the if
it's in the the game as a creature, it

412
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
it's in the the game as a creature, it
 

413
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,790
it's in the the game as a creature, it
is something that can be defeated

414
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
is something that can be defeated
 

415
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,310
is something that can be defeated
through combat. And if it's part of a

416
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
through combat. And if it's part of a
 

417
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,350
through combat. And if it's part of a
haunt, it probably cannot be defeated

418
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
haunt, it probably cannot be defeated
 

419
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,030
haunt, it probably cannot be defeated
through through combat. is going to be

420
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
through through combat. is going to be
 

421
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,110
through through combat. is going to be
dealt with through some other skills

422
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
dealt with through some other skills
 

423
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,829
dealt with through some other skills
that are laid out in the stat block for

424
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
that are laid out in the stat block for
 

425
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,630
that are laid out in the stat block for
that haunt. Um, another thing that's

426
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
that haunt. Um, another thing that's
 

427
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,509
that haunt. Um, another thing that's
worth mentioning with haunts is haunts

428
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
worth mentioning with haunts is haunts
 

429
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,269
worth mentioning with haunts is haunts
typically um always come back. So, uh,

430
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
typically um always come back. So, uh,
 

431
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,670
typically um always come back. So, uh,
you might disable them, but that disable

432
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
you might disable them, but that disable
 

433
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,990
you might disable them, but that disable
is going to be temporary. Sometimes they

434
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
is going to be temporary. Sometimes they
 

435
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,310
is going to be temporary. Sometimes they
they list an area of quote unfinished

436
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
they list an area of quote unfinished
 

437
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,790
they list an area of quote unfinished
business or that unfinished business is

438
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
business or that unfinished business is
 

439
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,630
business or that unfinished business is
is implied. And basically all that means

440
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
is implied. And basically all that means
 

441
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,190
is implied. And basically all that means
is unless you do a specific thing,

442
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
is unless you do a specific thing,
 

443
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,990
is unless you do a specific thing,
the haunt will return. You have to put

444
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
the haunt will return. You have to put
 

445
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,430
the haunt will return. You have to put
the souls of the spirits to rest in some

446
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
the souls of the spirits to rest in some
 

447
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,710
the souls of the spirits to rest in some
manner in order to completely deal with

448
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
manner in order to completely deal with
 

449
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,190
manner in order to completely deal with
a haunt. Whereas the other kinds of

450
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
a haunt. Whereas the other kinds of
 

451
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,630
a haunt. Whereas the other kinds of
hazards typically don't have those kind

452
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
hazards typically don't have those kind
 

453
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,069
hazards typically don't have those kind
of restrictions. Um mechanical traps

454
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
of restrictions. Um mechanical traps
 

455
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,069
of restrictions. Um mechanical traps
might come back and might have a reset

456
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
might come back and might have a reset
 

457
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,150
might come back and might have a reset
depending on how complex they are. Uh,

458
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
depending on how complex they are. Uh,
 

459
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,470
depending on how complex they are. Uh,
an avalanche is going to have a is going

460
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
an avalanche is going to have a is going
 

461
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,750
an avalanche is going to have a is going
to cease when it's done running out, but

462
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
to cease when it's done running out, but
 

463
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,310
to cease when it's done running out, but
haunts always come back unless uh their

464
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
haunts always come back unless uh their
 

465
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,630
haunts always come back unless uh their
unfinished business is dealt with. And

466
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
unfinished business is dealt with. And
 

467
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,550
unfinished business is dealt with. And
sometimes that unfinished business is

468
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
sometimes that unfinished business is
 

469
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,949
sometimes that unfinished business is
spelled out in the text and sometimes

470
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
spelled out in the text and sometimes
 

471
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,110
spelled out in the text and sometimes
you have to infer it on your own as a

472
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
you have to infer it on your own as a
 

473
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,470
you have to infer it on your own as a
GM. So, let's take a look at um at one

474
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
GM. So, let's take a look at um at one
 

475
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,190
GM. So, let's take a look at um at one
haunt uh and walk through it uh top to

476
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
haunt uh and walk through it uh top to
 

477
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,190
haunt uh and walk through it uh top to
bottom. And for this I'm going to be

478
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
bottom. And for this I'm going to be
 

479
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,550
bottom. And for this I'm going to be
using the eternal flame haunt out of GM

480
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
using the eternal flame haunt out of GM
 

481
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,949
using the eternal flame haunt out of GM
Core. So at the very top you can see is

482
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
Core. So at the very top you can see is
 

483
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,550
Core. So at the very top you can see is
it is a level seven hazard and it is uh

484
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
it is a level seven hazard and it is uh
 

485
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,670
it is a level seven hazard and it is uh
complex and it is a haunt. The first

486
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
complex and it is a haunt. The first
 

487
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,949
complex and it is a haunt. The first
area it says stealth plus 18 expert.

488
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
area it says stealth plus 18 expert.
 

489
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,550
area it says stealth plus 18 expert.
Okay. So, this gets into how do the

490
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
Okay. So, this gets into how do the
 

491
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,870
Okay. So, this gets into how do the
players realize

492
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
players realize
 

493
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,710
players realize
they're encountering a haunt before it

494
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
they're encountering a haunt before it
 

495
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,150
they're encountering a haunt before it
uh before it is triggered and does

496
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
uh before it is triggered and does
 

497
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,269
uh before it is triggered and does
whatever nasty thing is going to do. So

498
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
whatever nasty thing is going to do. So
 

499
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,150
whatever nasty thing is going to do. So
whenever players are in the general area

500
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
whenever players are in the general area
 

501
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,949
whenever players are in the general area
of a hazard and it's up to the GM just

502
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
of a hazard and it's up to the GM just
 

503
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,630
of a hazard and it's up to the GM just
to decide what they feel like is the

504
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
to decide what they feel like is the
 

505
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,110
to decide what they feel like is the
general area. The exact distance is

506
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
general area. The exact distance is
 

507
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,350
general area. The exact distance is
probably going to be different between a

508
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
probably going to be different between a
 

509
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,430
probably going to be different between a
small trap and uh again an avalanche,

510
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
small trap and uh again an avalanche,
 

511
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,069
small trap and uh again an avalanche,
right? So, uh, when players are in the

512
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
right? So, uh, when players are in the
 

513
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,790
right? So, uh, when players are in the
general vicinity of a hazard like

514
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
general vicinity of a hazard like
 

515
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,030
general vicinity of a hazard like
eternal flame here,

516
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
eternal flame here,
 

517
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,150
eternal flame here,
if the stealth rating does not have a

518
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
if the stealth rating does not have a
 

519
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,670
if the stealth rating does not have a
minimum proficiency here, it says

520
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
minimum proficiency here, it says
 

521
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,710
minimum proficiency here, it says
expert, but if it did not say expert,

522
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
expert, but if it did not say expert,
 

523
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,269
expert, but if it did not say expert,
then everybody automatically gets a free

524
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
then everybody automatically gets a free
 

525
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,750
then everybody automatically gets a free
uh perception check against the stealth

526
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
uh perception check against the stealth
 

527
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,310
uh perception check against the stealth
DC of that hazard to see if they can

528
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
DC of that hazard to see if they can
 

529
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,990
DC of that hazard to see if they can
notice that something is weird going on.

530
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
notice that something is weird going on.
 

531
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,350
notice that something is weird going on.
Now, here it says expert, which means

532
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
Now, here it says expert, which means
 

533
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,910
Now, here it says expert, which means
your players would not get that free

534
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
your players would not get that free
 

535
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,750
your players would not get that free
chance to to detect its presence.

536
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
chance to to detect its presence.
 

537
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,470
chance to to detect its presence.
Instead, they would have to actively

538
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
Instead, they would have to actively
 

539
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,910
Instead, they would have to actively
seek the area to detect it. [snorts] So,

540
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
seek the area to detect it. [snorts] So,
 

541
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,230
seek the area to detect it. [snorts] So,
we can see um well, let's take a look at

542
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
we can see um well, let's take a look at
 

543
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,430
we can see um well, let's take a look at
the description here. The description

544
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
the description here. The description
 

545
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,230
the description here. The description
here says, "A raging spectral inferno

546
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
here says, "A raging spectral inferno
 

547
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,069
here says, "A raging spectral inferno
arises out of thin air, strengthening

548
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
arises out of thin air, strengthening
 

549
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,389
arises out of thin air, strengthening
all undead creatures within its area.

550
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
all undead creatures within its area.
 

551
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,629
all undead creatures within its area.
This haunt most often arises from the

552
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
This haunt most often arises from the
 

553
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,550
This haunt most often arises from the
charred remains of a group of three

554
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
charred remains of a group of three
 

555
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,030
charred remains of a group of three
people who burn to death whether in a

556
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
people who burn to death whether in a
 

557
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,949
people who burn to death whether in a
terrible accident or a deliberate

558
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
terrible accident or a deliberate
 

559
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,670
terrible accident or a deliberate
execution and their unavvenged souls

560
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
execution and their unavvenged souls
 

561
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,430
execution and their unavvenged souls
burn with rage. All right, so we have

562
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
burn with rage. All right, so we have
 

563
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,069
burn with rage. All right, so we have
the charred remains of three bodies and

564
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
the charred remains of three bodies and
 

565
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,829
the charred remains of three bodies and
the uh psychic anguish of their death is

566
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
the uh psychic anguish of their death is
 

567
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,710
the uh psychic anguish of their death is
leaving this this aura in this area that

568
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
leaving this this aura in this area that
 

569
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,750
leaving this this aura in this area that
can uh manifest when living creatures

570
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
can uh manifest when living creatures
 

571
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,949
can uh manifest when living creatures
are are too close to it. So we could say

572
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
are are too close to it. So we could say
 

573
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,870
are are too close to it. So we could say
our players walk into a cave and inside

574
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
our players walk into a cave and inside
 

575
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,590
our players walk into a cave and inside
that cave they see three charred bodies.

576
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
that cave they see three charred bodies.
 

577
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,629
that cave they see three charred bodies.
Now that might be a hint to the players

578
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
Now that might be a hint to the players
 

579
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,110
Now that might be a hint to the players
immediately to start making perception

580
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
immediately to start making perception
 

581
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,269
immediately to start making perception
checks. So if at that point a player

582
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
checks. So if at that point a player
 

583
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,670
checks. So if at that point a player
says you know this this doesn't sound

584
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
says you know this this doesn't sound
 

585
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,030
says you know this this doesn't sound
right. I want to look around. I want to

586
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
right. I want to look around. I want to
 

587
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,150
right. I want to look around. I want to
make a a seek action.

588
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
make a a seek action.
 

589
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,590
make a a seek action.
As long as they have not triggered the

590
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
As long as they have not triggered the
 

591
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,910
As long as they have not triggered the
haunt or the hazard. Uh if we look down

592
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
haunt or the hazard. Uh if we look down
 

593
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,829
haunt or the hazard. Uh if we look down
a little bit, we can see uh that the uh

594
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
a little bit, we can see uh that the uh
 

595
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,710
a little bit, we can see uh that the uh
trigger for this is a living creature

596
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
trigger for this is a living creature
 

597
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,870
trigger for this is a living creature
approaches within 10 ft of the remains

598
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
approaches within 10 ft of the remains
 

599
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,509
approaches within 10 ft of the remains
of one of those victims.

600
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
of one of those victims.
 

601
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,110
of one of those victims.
So as long as they haven't moved their

602
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
So as long as they haven't moved their
 

603
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,750
So as long as they haven't moved their
mini within 10 ft of those bodies and

604
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
mini within 10 ft of those bodies and
 

605
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,509
mini within 10 ft of those bodies and
they say I want to make a perception

606
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
they say I want to make a perception
 

607
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,910
they say I want to make a perception
check to seek, then the GM is going to

608
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
check to seek, then the GM is going to
 

609
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,629
check to seek, then the GM is going to
make a secret perception check. uh apply

610
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
make a secret perception check. uh apply
 

611
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,629
make a secret perception check. uh apply
the perception of that character and if

612
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
the perception of that character and if
 

613
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,829
the perception of that character and if
it is in this case if that total is a 28

614
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
it is in this case if that total is a 28
 

615
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,470
it is in this case if that total is a 28
or higher then they succeed. Uh 28

616
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
or higher then they succeed. Uh 28
 

617
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,550
or higher then they succeed. Uh 28
because if your stealth bonus is plus 18

618
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
because if your stealth bonus is plus 18
 

619
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,829
because if your stealth bonus is plus 18
then your stealth DC is 28. Now uh a lot

620
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
then your stealth DC is 28. Now uh a lot
 

621
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,269
then your stealth DC is 28. Now uh a lot
of this comes down to mechanical

622
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
of this comes down to mechanical
 

623
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,870
of this comes down to mechanical
terminology. I'm not a huge fan of it

624
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
terminology. I'm not a huge fan of it
 

625
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,629
terminology. I'm not a huge fan of it
having stealth written here. I

626
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
having stealth written here. I
 

627
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,750
having stealth written here. I
understand why it is uh because of the

628
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
understand why it is uh because of the
 

629
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,550
understand why it is uh because of the
mechanics of the game, but it that seems

630
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
mechanics of the game, but it that seems
 

631
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,910
mechanics of the game, but it that seems
to give an impression that like oh the

632
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
to give an impression that like oh the
 

633
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,230
to give an impression that like oh the
the trap is hiding from people. It's

634
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
the trap is hiding from people. It's
 

635
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,870
the trap is hiding from people. It's
actively sneaking around. And I think

636
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
actively sneaking around. And I think
 

637
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,829
actively sneaking around. And I think
some people uh can misinterpret that as

638
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
some people uh can misinterpret that as
 

639
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,389
some people uh can misinterpret that as
meaning that there are three spirit

640
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
meaning that there are three spirit
 

641
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,829
meaning that there are three spirit
ghosts from the three charred remains

642
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
ghosts from the three charred remains
 

643
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,430
ghosts from the three charred remains
and those ghosts are in the room and the

644
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
and those ghosts are in the room and the
 

645
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,990
and those ghosts are in the room and the
ghosts are hiding from the players. And

646
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
ghosts are hiding from the players. And
 

647
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,310
ghosts are hiding from the players. And
that's not what it means. It just means

648
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
that's not what it means. It just means
 

649
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,110
that's not what it means. It just means
that uh it's not easy to realize that

650
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
that uh it's not easy to realize that
 

651
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,189
that uh it's not easy to realize that
there's more to these three chart bodies

652
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
there's more to these three chart bodies
 

653
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,150
there's more to these three chart bodies
than meets the eye. Now, if that player

654
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
than meets the eye. Now, if that player
 

655
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,110
than meets the eye. Now, if that player
rolls or or you roll on their behalf, I

656
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
rolls or or you roll on their behalf, I
 

657
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,189
rolls or or you roll on their behalf, I
should say, their perception check to

658
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
should say, their perception check to
 

659
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,990
should say, their perception check to
seek and they succeed, then you as the

660
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
seek and they succeed, then you as the
 

661
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,189
seek and they succeed, then you as the
GM have to explain to the player what it

662
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
GM have to explain to the player what it
 

663
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,030
GM have to explain to the player what it
is they're perceiving that might tip

664
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
is they're perceiving that might tip
 

665
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,829
is they're perceiving that might tip
them off that this is in fact a haunt.

666
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
them off that this is in fact a haunt.
 

667
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,550
them off that this is in fact a haunt.
So, you might say even though the the

668
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
So, you might say even though the the
 

669
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,430
So, you might say even though the the
bodies look like they're they are long

670
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
bodies look like they're they are long
 

671
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,829
bodies look like they're they are long
past burnt, like you know, this this had

672
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
past burnt, like you know, this this had
 

673
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,790
past burnt, like you know, this this had
to have taken place uh a year plus ago,

674
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
to have taken place uh a year plus ago,
 

675
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,590
to have taken place uh a year plus ago,
but you still smell you can still smell

676
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
but you still smell you can still smell
 

677
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,629
but you still smell you can still smell
the fire as if it was live or or maybe

678
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
the fire as if it was live or or maybe
 

679
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,629
the fire as if it was live or or maybe
you can hear the crackling of the flames

680
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
you can hear the crackling of the flames
 

681
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,829
you can hear the crackling of the flames
or or you can hear just a faint echo of

682
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
or or you can hear just a faint echo of
 

683
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,829
or or you can hear just a faint echo of
of the anguish of the people who are

684
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
of the anguish of the people who are
 

685
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,030
of the anguish of the people who are
burning. whatever it is, uh, that would

686
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
burning. whatever it is, uh, that would
 

687
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,350
burning. whatever it is, uh, that would
be appropriate to this area to signal to

688
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
be appropriate to this area to signal to
 

689
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,870
be appropriate to this area to signal to
that player that they succeeded their

690
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
that player that they succeeded their
 

691
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,590
that player that they succeeded their
perception check. And they know there's

692
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
perception check. And they know there's
 

693
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,069
perception check. And they know there's
more going on here than just the remains

694
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
more going on here than just the remains
 

695
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,030
more going on here than just the remains
of three bodies.

696
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
of three bodies.
 

697
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,670
of three bodies.
So, at that point, if they're

698
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
So, at that point, if they're
 

699
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,150
So, at that point, if they're
successful, a player will likely want to

700
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
successful, a player will likely want to
 

701
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,470
successful, a player will likely want to
know more about this. Now, the

702
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
know more about this. Now, the
 

703
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,470
know more about this. Now, the
perception check might let them know

704
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
perception check might let them know
 

705
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,310
perception check might let them know
that they're dealing with a hazard of

706
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
that they're dealing with a hazard of
 

707
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,990
that they're dealing with a hazard of
some kind, but that does not tell them

708
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
some kind, but that does not tell them
 

709
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,829
some kind, but that does not tell them
necessarily exactly what kind of hazard

710
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
necessarily exactly what kind of hazard
 

711
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,710
necessarily exactly what kind of hazard
or haunt and what's going to happen and

712
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
or haunt and what's going to happen and
 

713
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,350
or haunt and what's going to happen and
how and when. So, at that point, a

714
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
how and when. So, at that point, a
 

715
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,670
how and when. So, at that point, a
player would likely say, I want to do a

716
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
player would likely say, I want to do a
 

717
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,470
player would likely say, I want to do a
recall knowledge check and I want to,

718
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
recall knowledge check and I want to,
 

719
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,069
recall knowledge check and I want to,
you know, exam. I want to see if I could

720
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
you know, exam. I want to see if I could
 

721
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,710
you know, exam. I want to see if I could
figure anything else about this area.

722
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
figure anything else about this area.
 

723
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,430
figure anything else about this area.
Now, it's not spelled out um in the stat

724
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
Now, it's not spelled out um in the stat
 

725
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,990
Now, it's not spelled out um in the stat
blocks of what the recall knowledge

726
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
blocks of what the recall knowledge
 

727
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,590
blocks of what the recall knowledge
checks would be, but uh you would base

728
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
checks would be, but uh you would base
 

729
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,509
checks would be, but uh you would base
the DC on the level of the hazard. So,

730
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
the DC on the level of the hazard. So,
 

731
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,389
the DC on the level of the hazard. So,
this hazard is uh a seventh level

732
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
this hazard is uh a seventh level
 

733
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,949
this hazard is uh a seventh level
hazard. And if we look up in in GM Core,

734
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
hazard. And if we look up in in GM Core,
 

735
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,910
hazard. And if we look up in in GM Core,
a seventh level hazard has a standard DC

736
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
a seventh level hazard has a standard DC
 

737
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,269
a seventh level hazard has a standard DC
of 23. So, if a player wants to know

738
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
of 23. So, if a player wants to know
 

739
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,069
of 23. So, if a player wants to know
more about what they're looking at here,

740
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
more about what they're looking at here,
 

741
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,670
more about what they're looking at here,
you would do a recall knowledge check

742
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
you would do a recall knowledge check
 

743
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,430
you would do a recall knowledge check
for them. This would be a secret check

744
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
for them. This would be a secret check
 

745
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,189
for them. This would be a secret check
behind your screen, as all recall

746
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
behind your screen, as all recall
 

747
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,790
behind your screen, as all recall
knowledge checks are. And uh I typically

748
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
knowledge checks are. And uh I typically
 

749
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,189
knowledge checks are. And uh I typically
would use whatever skills are used to

750
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
would use whatever skills are used to
 

751
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,870
would use whatever skills are used to
disable it as the skill for recall

752
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
disable it as the skill for recall
 

753
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,029
disable it as the skill for recall
knowledge. So, in this case, it can be

754
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
knowledge. So, in this case, it can be
 

755
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,870
knowledge. So, in this case, it can be
disabled with a religion uh skill. A

756
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
disabled with a religion uh skill. A
 

757
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,189
disabled with a religion uh skill. A
religion is a type of knowledge skill.

758
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
religion is a type of knowledge skill.
 

759
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,630
religion is a type of knowledge skill.
So, I would be rolling uh a secret

760
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
So, I would be rolling uh a secret
 

761
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,390
So, I would be rolling uh a secret
religion check for that player DC23.

762
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
religion check for that player DC23.
 

763
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,789
religion check for that player DC23.
Uh I'll also say um something that I do

764
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
Uh I'll also say um something that I do
 

765
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,789
Uh I'll also say um something that I do
that's absolutely not in the rules. This

766
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
that's absolutely not in the rules. This
 

767
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,430
that's absolutely not in the rules. This
is not um official ro this is a house

768
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
is not um official ro this is a house
 

769
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,710
is not um official ro this is a house
rule territory. I also typically allow

770
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
rule territory. I also typically allow
 

771
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,110
rule territory. I also typically allow
those same knowledge skills that can be

772
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
those same knowledge skills that can be
 

773
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,750
those same knowledge skills that can be
used to disable the haunt to be used to

774
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
used to disable the haunt to be used to
 

775
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,470
used to disable the haunt to be used to
perceive the haunt. So, if someone has a

776
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
perceive the haunt. So, if someone has a
 

777
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,029
perceive the haunt. So, if someone has a
higher bonus to religion than they do to

778
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
higher bonus to religion than they do to
 

779
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,710
higher bonus to religion than they do to
perception, I might roll that as their

780
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
perception, I might roll that as their
 

781
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,390
perception, I might roll that as their
perception

782
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
perception
 

783
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,390
perception
um to let them detect the fact that

784
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
um to let them detect the fact that
 

785
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,430
um to let them detect the fact that
they're in the presence of a haunt. Uh

786
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
they're in the presence of a haunt. Uh
 

787
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,350
they're in the presence of a haunt. Uh
that seems to make a little more sense

788
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
that seems to make a little more sense
 

789
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,310
that seems to make a little more sense
in my mind and it also gives a little

790
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
in my mind and it also gives a little
 

791
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,710
in my mind and it also gives a little
more room for for niche characters. Like

792
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
more room for for niche characters. Like
 

793
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,390
more room for for niche characters. Like
if you only have one religion character

794
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
if you only have one religion character
 

795
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,230
if you only have one religion character
in the party, it gives them an extra

796
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
in the party, it gives them an extra
 

797
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,789
in the party, it gives them an extra
moment to shine. Uh, so that's something

798
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
moment to shine. Uh, so that's something
 

799
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,630
moment to shine. Uh, so that's something
that I do, but I do want to just be

800
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
that I do, but I do want to just be
 

801
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,950
that I do, but I do want to just be
clear that that is house rule territory.

802
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
clear that that is house rule territory.
 

803
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,870
clear that that is house rule territory.
That's not official. That's just

804
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
That's not official. That's just
 

805
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,310
That's not official. That's just
something that I do. But anyway,

806
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
something that I do. But anyway,
 

807
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,150
something that I do. But anyway,
you would you would roll that for them

808
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
you would you would roll that for them
 

809
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,710
you would you would roll that for them
in secret. And like with all recall

810
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
in secret. And like with all recall
 

811
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,470
in secret. And like with all recall
knowledge checks, you would ask them,

812
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
knowledge checks, you would ask them,
 

813
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,549
knowledge checks, you would ask them,
you know, like, give me a a question you

814
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
you know, like, give me a a question you
 

815
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,710
you know, like, give me a a question you
want to you want to have answered. And

816
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
want to you want to have answered. And
 

817
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,909
want to you want to have answered. And
that question might be, well, um, I want

818
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
that question might be, well, um, I want
 

819
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,789
that question might be, well, um, I want
to know, is this area dangerous? And if

820
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
to know, is this area dangerous? And if
 

821
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,590
to know, is this area dangerous? And if
so, what kind of danger are we facing?

822
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
so, what kind of danger are we facing?
 

823
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,150
so, what kind of danger are we facing?
Well, if they roll uh if you roll that

824
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
Well, if they roll uh if you roll that
 

825
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,830
Well, if they roll uh if you roll that
secret check for them, religion and

826
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
secret check for them, religion and
 

827
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,430
secret check for them, religion and
beast of DC23, I might say, well, you

828
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
beast of DC23, I might say, well, you
 

829
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,630
beast of DC23, I might say, well, you
you're pretty sure you're in the

830
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
you're pretty sure you're in the
 

831
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,150
you're pretty sure you're in the
presence of a haunt here, and you you

832
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
presence of a haunt here, and you you
 

833
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,150
presence of a haunt here, and you you
think that the the anguish of the three

834
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
think that the the anguish of the three
 

835
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,190
think that the the anguish of the three
charred uh people that their spirits are

836
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
charred uh people that their spirits are
 

837
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,510
charred uh people that their spirits are
still uh they're they're anchored here

838
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
still uh they're they're anchored here
 

839
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,510
still uh they're they're anchored here
to this location. And if you get too

840
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
to this location. And if you get too
 

841
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,350
to this location. And if you get too
close, you might experience a a psychic

842
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
close, you might experience a a psychic
 

843
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,390
close, you might experience a a psychic
or illusory manifestation of the same

844
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
or illusory manifestation of the same
 

845
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,990
or illusory manifestation of the same
tragedy that killed them. And that might

846
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
tragedy that killed them. And that might
 

847
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,909
tragedy that killed them. And that might
clue that player into, well, I better

848
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
clue that player into, well, I better
 

849
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,310
clue that player into, well, I better
not get I better not walk any closer or

850
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
not get I better not walk any closer or
 

851
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,789
not get I better not walk any closer or
I might catch on fire like they did or

852
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
I might catch on fire like they did or
 

853
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,029
I might catch on fire like they did or
what have you. So then let's say that

854
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
what have you. So then let's say that
 

855
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,150
what have you. So then let's say that
the player wants to make another recall

856
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
the player wants to make another recall
 

857
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,710
the player wants to make another recall
knowledge check. And this time is to

858
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
knowledge check. And this time is to
 

859
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,710
knowledge check. And this time is to
figure out, well, what do I need to do

860
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
figure out, well, what do I need to do
 

861
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,909
figure out, well, what do I need to do
to avoid the danger here? How can we,

862
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
to avoid the danger here? How can we,
 

863
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,110
to avoid the danger here? How can we,
you know, quote disable it? Um, how can

864
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
you know, quote disable it? Um, how can
 

865
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,510
you know, quote disable it? Um, how can
we put these souls and spirits to risk

866
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
we put these souls and spirits to risk
 

867
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,230
we put these souls and spirits to risk
so there's no more danger in this room?

868
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
so there's no more danger in this room?
 

869
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,350
so there's no more danger in this room?
And in that case, you're going to then

870
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
And in that case, you're going to then
 

871
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,590
And in that case, you're going to then
make another recall knowledge check.

872
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
make another recall knowledge check.
 

873
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,990
make another recall knowledge check.
Now, because you're making a second

874
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
Now, because you're making a second
 

875
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,909
Now, because you're making a second
recall knowledge check on the same

876
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
recall knowledge check on the same
 

877
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,029
recall knowledge check on the same
topic, then the DC is going to go up one

878
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
topic, then the DC is going to go up one
 

879
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,110
topic, then the DC is going to go up one
step, and in this case, it would go from

880
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
step, and in this case, it would go from
 

881
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,150
step, and in this case, it would go from
being a normal DC to a hard DC, which

882
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
being a normal DC to a hard DC, which
 

883
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,870
being a normal DC to a hard DC, which
adds two to it and raises raises the DC

884
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
adds two to it and raises raises the DC
 

885
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,070
adds two to it and raises raises the DC
from uh 23 to 25. If that sounds

886
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
from uh 23 to 25. If that sounds
 

887
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,549
from uh 23 to 25. If that sounds
confusing or is not uh clear to you,

888
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
confusing or is not uh clear to you,
 

889
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,549
confusing or is not uh clear to you,
I'll leave a link in the description to

890
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
I'll leave a link in the description to
 

891
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,150
I'll leave a link in the description to
my video that's all about recall

892
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,160
my video that's all about recall
 

893
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,390
my video that's all about recall
knowledge checks, and that might shed

894
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
knowledge checks, and that might shed
 

895
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,789
knowledge checks, and that might shed
some light on it. But basically uh

896
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
some light on it. But basically uh
 

897
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,630
some light on it. But basically uh
players can continuously do recall

898
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
players can continuously do recall
 

899
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,029
players can continuously do recall
knowledge checks over and over again uh

900
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
knowledge checks over and over again uh
 

901
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,029
knowledge checks over and over again uh
until they fail one in which case that

902
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
until they fail one in which case that
 

903
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,870
until they fail one in which case that
signals they no longer can get any more

904
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
signals they no longer can get any more
 

905
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,470
signals they no longer can get any more
information on the topic or they uh do a

906
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
information on the topic or they uh do a
 

907
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,590
information on the topic or they uh do a
uh the highest level of check. Um is

908
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
uh the highest level of check. Um is
 

909
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,870
uh the highest level of check. Um is
that a possible difficulty? I can't

910
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
that a possible difficulty? I can't
 

911
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,549
that a possible difficulty? I can't
remember the difficulty name but once

912
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
remember the difficulty name but once
 

913
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,470
remember the difficulty name but once
they get to the highest uh difficulty

914
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
they get to the highest uh difficulty
 

915
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,750
they get to the highest uh difficulty
level they can't make any more after

916
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
level they can't make any more after
 

917
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,909
level they can't make any more after
that. But anyway we'll we'll say that

918
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
that. But anyway we'll we'll say that
 

919
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,310
that. But anyway we'll we'll say that
they want to make another recall

920
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
they want to make another recall
 

921
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,950
they want to make another recall
knowledge check on this topic. you as

922
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
knowledge check on this topic. you as
 

923
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,830
knowledge check on this topic. you as
the GM, this is a a secret check, like

924
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
the GM, this is a a secret check, like
 

925
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,270
the GM, this is a a secret check, like
all recall knowledge checks, you roll

926
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
all recall knowledge checks, you roll
 

927
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,390
all recall knowledge checks, you roll
that behind the screen. And if they get

928
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
that behind the screen. And if they get
 

929
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,149
that behind the screen. And if they get
a uh a 25 or higher on that religion

930
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
a uh a 25 or higher on that religion
 

931
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,789
a uh a 25 or higher on that religion
check, then you can go over some of the

932
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
check, then you can go over some of the
 

933
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,310
check, then you can go over some of the
ways to disable the haunt. In this case,

934
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
ways to disable the haunt. In this case,
 

935
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,070
ways to disable the haunt. In this case,
it says a DC27 diplomacy expert to

936
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
it says a DC27 diplomacy expert to
 

937
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,549
it says a DC27 diplomacy expert to
temporarily calm the rage of one of the

938
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
temporarily calm the rage of one of the
 

939
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,470
temporarily calm the rage of one of the
three spirits or a DC30 religion trained

940
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
three spirits or a DC30 religion trained
 

941
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,430
three spirits or a DC30 religion trained
to exercise one of the spirits. Three

942
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
to exercise one of the spirits. Three
 

943
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,390
to exercise one of the spirits. Three
total successes are required to disable

944
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
total successes are required to disable
 

945
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,390
total successes are required to disable
the haunt.

946
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
the haunt.
 

947
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,149
the haunt.
Okay, so a couple things here. First of

948
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
Okay, so a couple things here. First of
 

949
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,350
Okay, so a couple things here. First of
those is that since both of these uh

950
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
those is that since both of these uh
 

951
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,190
those is that since both of these uh
checks have uh uh per uh proficiency

952
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
checks have uh uh per uh proficiency
 

953
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,270
checks have uh uh per uh proficiency

minimum proficiency levels in order to
 

961
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,470
minimum proficiency levels in order to
do it. Someone who's merely trained in

962
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
do it. Someone who's merely trained in
 

963
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,669
do it. Someone who's merely trained in
diplomacy would not be able to compel

964
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
diplomacy would not be able to compel
 

965
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,190
diplomacy would not be able to compel
the uh spirits to calm down. uh someone

the uh spirits to calm down. uh someone
 

967
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,789
the uh spirits to calm down. uh someone
who's untrained in religion wouldn't

who's untrained in religion wouldn't
 

969
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,750
who's untrained in religion wouldn't
have the knowledge to exercise them from

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
have the knowledge to exercise them from
 

971
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,630
have the knowledge to exercise them from
the uh from the chamber. Uh and some of

972
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
the uh from the chamber. Uh and some of
 

973
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,710
the uh from the chamber. Uh and some of
the other things that talk about here

974
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
the other things that talk about here
 

975
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,230
the other things that talk about here
are a couple of the questions that came

976
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
are a couple of the questions that came
 

977
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,990
are a couple of the questions that came
along with the the request to go over

978
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
along with the the request to go over
 

979
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,470
along with the the request to go over
this. The first is does it take two

980
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
this. The first is does it take two
 

981
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,029
this. The first is does it take two
actions to disable a haunt with a

982
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
actions to disable a haunt with a
 

983
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,310
actions to disable a haunt with a
knowledge skill? Okay, so it takes two

984
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
knowledge skill? Okay, so it takes two
 

985
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,870
knowledge skill? Okay, so it takes two
actions to use thievery on disabled

986
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
actions to use thievery on disabled
 

987
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,789
actions to use thievery on disabled
device to disable a mechanical trap. Uh

988
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
device to disable a mechanical trap. Uh
 

989
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,950
device to disable a mechanical trap. Uh
we're not using a thievery and disabled

990
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
we're not using a thievery and disabled
 

991
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,390
we're not using a thievery and disabled
device here. Instead, we're using

992
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
device here. Instead, we're using
 

993
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,669
device here. Instead, we're using
skills. So, does it take uh two actions

994
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
skills. So, does it take uh two actions
 

995
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,070
skills. So, does it take uh two actions
to um to disable this haunt using

996
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
to um to disable this haunt using
 

997
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,029
to um to disable this haunt using
religion or diplomacy? Well, if we take

998
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
religion or diplomacy? Well, if we take
 

999
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,270
religion or diplomacy? Well, if we take
a look at the uh section on disabling a

1000
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
a look at the uh section on disabling a
 

1001
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,789
a look at the uh section on disabling a
hazard,

1002
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
hazard,
 

1003
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,710
hazard,
it says the specific skill and DC

1004
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
it says the specific skill and DC
 

1005
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,029
it says the specific skill and DC
required to disable a hazard listed in

1006
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
required to disable a hazard listed in
 

1007
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,909
required to disable a hazard listed in
the hazard stat block. Like using

1008
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
the hazard stat block. Like using
 

1009
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,710
the hazard stat block. Like using
disable a device, using these skills to

1010
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
disable a device, using these skills to
 

1011
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,950
disable a device, using these skills to
disable a trap is a twoaction activity

1012
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
disable a trap is a twoaction activity
 

1013
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,549
disable a trap is a twoaction activity
with the same degrees of success. Though

1014
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
with the same degrees of success. Though
 

1015
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,110
with the same degrees of success. Though
the activity might have different traits

1016
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
the activity might have different traits
 

1017
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,390
the activity might have different traits
determined by the GM. Okay, so this is

1018
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
determined by the GM. Okay, so this is
 

1019
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,510
determined by the GM. Okay, so this is
an area that might be a point of

1020
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
an area that might be a point of
 

1021
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,549
an area that might be a point of
contention with some people. Um,

1022
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
contention with some people. Um,
 

1023
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,549
contention with some people. Um,
going strictly by a raw reading of this,

1024
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
going strictly by a raw reading of this,
 

1025
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,590
going strictly by a raw reading of this,
it says like using disable a device,

1026
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
it says like using disable a device,
 

1027
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,909
it says like using disable a device,
using these skills to disable a trap

1028
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
using these skills to disable a trap
 

1029
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,630
using these skills to disable a trap
is a twoaction activity. Um,

1030
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
is a twoaction activity. Um,
 

1031
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,789
is a twoaction activity. Um,
a trap is a specific kind of hazard.

1032
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
a trap is a specific kind of hazard.
 

1033
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,870
a trap is a specific kind of hazard.
To me, that is pretty clear that the two

1034
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
To me, that is pretty clear that the two
 

1035
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,830
To me, that is pretty clear that the two
action activity only applies to

1036
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
action activity only applies to
 

1037
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,270
action activity only applies to
disabling traps. I feel like if they

1038
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
disabling traps. I feel like if they
 

1039
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,549
disabling traps. I feel like if they
wanted that to apply to haunts or if

1040
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
wanted that to apply to haunts or if
 

1041
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,710
wanted that to apply to haunts or if
they wanted it to apply to the nature

1042
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
they wanted it to apply to the nature
 

1043
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,830
they wanted it to apply to the nature
and uh survival checks that are used to

1044
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
and uh survival checks that are used to
 

1045
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,750
and uh survival checks that are used to
disable environmental hazards, then it

1046
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
disable environmental hazards, then it
 

1047
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,070
disable environmental hazards, then it
would say like using disabled device,

1048
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
would say like using disabled device,
 

1049
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,430
would say like using disabled device,
using these skills to disable a hazard

1050
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
using these skills to disable a hazard
 

1051
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,029
using these skills to disable a hazard
is a two action activity. Um but that's

1052
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
is a two action activity. Um but that's
 

1053
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,789
is a two action activity. Um but that's
not what it says. It specifically says

1054
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
not what it says. It specifically says
 

1055
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,710
not what it says. It specifically says
trap. So for me and my reading of that

1056
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
trap. So for me and my reading of that
 

1057
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,909
trap. So for me and my reading of that
is that if you're using a diplomacy or

1058
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
is that if you're using a diplomacy or
 

1059
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,470
is that if you're using a diplomacy or
you are using uh religion to um to

1060
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
you are using uh religion to um to
 

1061
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,390
you are using uh religion to um to
disable this haunt then it is one action

1062
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
disable this haunt then it is one action
 

1063
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,430
disable this haunt then it is one action
to use either of those to do so.

1064
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
to use either of those to do so.
 

1065
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,750
to use either of those to do so.
However, there is a notation here that

1066
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
However, there is a notation here that
 

1067
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,549
However, there is a notation here that
says three total successes are required.

1068
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
says three total successes are required.
 

1069
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,950
says three total successes are required.
So it's not a one and done. So therefore

1070
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
So it's not a one and done. So therefore
 

1071
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,710
So it's not a one and done. So therefore
it's going to be a minimum of three

1072
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:22,720
it's going to be a minimum of three
 

1073
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,630
it's going to be a minimum of three
actions assuming that you succeed on all

1074
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
actions assuming that you succeed on all
 

1075
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,510
actions assuming that you succeed on all
of the checks. Now uh another uh

1076
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
of the checks. Now uh another uh
 

1077
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,269
of the checks. Now uh another uh
question that came up with this was can

1078
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
question that came up with this was can
 

1079
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,149
question that came up with this was can
you use three straight actions if it is

1080
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
you use three straight actions if it is
 

1081
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,149
you use three straight actions if it is
uh religion?

1082
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
uh religion?
 

1083
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,190
uh religion?
Yes. Uh my reading since it is only one

1084
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
Yes. Uh my reading since it is only one
 

1085
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,549
Yes. Uh my reading since it is only one
action to use these to disable it. It

1086
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
action to use these to disable it. It
 

1087
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,590
action to use these to disable it. It
takes three successes. You could you

1088
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
takes three successes. You could you
 

1089
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,830
takes three successes. You could you
spend your entire turn, your three

1090
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
spend your entire turn, your three
 

1091
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,110
spend your entire turn, your three
actions doing uh diplomacy and or

1092
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
actions doing uh diplomacy and or
 

1093
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,870
actions doing uh diplomacy and or
religion in any any combination of

1094
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
religion in any any combination of
 

1095
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,669
religion in any any combination of
those. If you succeed on all three, then

1096
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
those. If you succeed on all three, then
 

1097
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,310
those. If you succeed on all three, then
you disable all of them um right off the

1098
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
you disable all of them um right off the
 

1099
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,870
you disable all of them um right off the
bat uh or at least before it's triggered

1100
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
bat uh or at least before it's triggered
 

1101
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,029
bat uh or at least before it's triggered
as long as you have not entered within

1102
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
as long as you have not entered within
 

1103
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,990
as long as you have not entered within
uh 10 ft of of it. Um,

1104
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
uh 10 ft of of it. Um,
 

1105
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,710
uh 10 ft of of it. Um,
and also it says, "Is it standard one

1106
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
and also it says, "Is it standard one
 

1107
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,710
and also it says, "Is it standard one
success removes the haunt unless

1108
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
success removes the haunt unless
 

1109
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,669
success removes the haunt unless
otherwise noted?" Uh, yes. If if there's

1110
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679
otherwise noted?" Uh, yes. If if there's
 

1111
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,990
otherwise noted?" Uh, yes. If if there's
no nothing in the disable area that says

1112
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
no nothing in the disable area that says
 

1113
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,470
no nothing in the disable area that says
that uh it takes multiple successes,

1114
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
that uh it takes multiple successes,
 

1115
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,990
that uh it takes multiple successes,
like this one specifically says three

1116
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
like this one specifically says three
 

1117
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,710
like this one specifically says three
successes, then it would just be one

1118
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
successes, then it would just be one
 

1119
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,909
successes, then it would just be one
success to disable the haunt. And one

1120
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
success to disable the haunt. And one
 

1121
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,830
success to disable the haunt. And one
more thing to talk about uh disabling

1122
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
more thing to talk about uh disabling
 

1123
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,190
more thing to talk about uh disabling
with using these skills. Um, I have I

1124
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
with using these skills. Um, I have I
 

1125
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,269
with using these skills. Um, I have I
have seen it mentioned sometimes that

1126
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
have seen it mentioned sometimes that
 

1127
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,630
have seen it mentioned sometimes that
people confuse using religion here or

1128
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
people confuse using religion here or
 

1129
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,470
people confuse using religion here or
using a cultism in a haunt to be the

1130
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
using a cultism in a haunt to be the
 

1131
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,070
using a cultism in a haunt to be the
same as a recall knowledge check. And so

1132
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
same as a recall knowledge check. And so
 

1133
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,470
same as a recall knowledge check. And so
the the thought there is that if you

1134
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
the the thought there is that if you
 

1135
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,310
the the thought there is that if you
fail one, you cannot make any additional

1136
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
fail one, you cannot make any additional
 

1137
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,310
fail one, you cannot make any additional
ones. And if you uh and every time that

1138
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
ones. And if you uh and every time that
 

1139
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,950
ones. And if you uh and every time that
you succeed, the DC goes up. uh when

1140
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
you succeed, the DC goes up. uh when
 

1141
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,789
you succeed, the DC goes up. uh when
you're using those skills, those

1142
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
you're using those skills, those
 

1143
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,830
you're using those skills, those
knowledge skills to disable, you are not

1144
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
knowledge skills to disable, you are not
 

1145
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,390
knowledge skills to disable, you are not
making recall knowledge checks. They're

1146
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,400
making recall knowledge checks. They're
 

1147
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,190
making recall knowledge checks. They're
just normal straight up skill checks and

1148
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
just normal straight up skill checks and
 

1149
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,830
just normal straight up skill checks and
therefore they don't have those uh

1150
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
therefore they don't have those uh
 

1151
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,510
therefore they don't have those uh
limitations that are applied

1152
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
limitations that are applied
 

1153
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,669
limitations that are applied
specifically to recall knowledge. Unless

1154
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
specifically to recall knowledge. Unless
 

1155
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,590
specifically to recall knowledge. Unless
this has the words recall knowledge in

1156
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
this has the words recall knowledge in
 

1157
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,909
this has the words recall knowledge in
the disabled text, then this is just a

1158
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
the disabled text, then this is just a
 

1159
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,830
the disabled text, then this is just a
straight skill check, just a straight

1160
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
straight skill check, just a straight
 

1161
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,470
straight skill check, just a straight
normal check, not recall knowledge. you

1162
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
normal check, not recall knowledge. you
 

1163
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,950
normal check, not recall knowledge. you
don't need to worry about um about

1164
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
don't need to worry about um about
 

1165
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,110
don't need to worry about um about
having to increase the DC after every

1166
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
having to increase the DC after every
 

1167
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,430
having to increase the DC after every
check or having there be a ceiling to

1168
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
check or having there be a ceiling to
 

1169
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,390
check or having there be a ceiling to
it. All right, but let's say that the

1170
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
it. All right, but let's say that the
 

1171
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,190
it. All right, but let's say that the
players in this case did not succeed on

1172
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
players in this case did not succeed on
 

1173
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,149
players in this case did not succeed on
their their seek action to detect the

1174
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
their their seek action to detect the
 

1175
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,310
their their seek action to detect the
presence of danger and the presence of

1176
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
presence of danger and the presence of
 

1177
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,350
presence of danger and the presence of
the haunt or they failed at their skill

1178
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
the haunt or they failed at their skill
 

1179
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,669
the haunt or they failed at their skill
checks to recall knowledge and and one

1180
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
checks to recall knowledge and and one
 

1181
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,870
checks to recall knowledge and and one
of them walks within 10 ft of one of the

1182
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
of them walks within 10 ft of one of the
 

1183
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,870
of them walks within 10 ft of one of the
three corpses. What happens then? Well,

1184
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
three corpses. What happens then? Well,
 

1185
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,630
three corpses. What happens then? Well,
that's where we get into the actual

1186
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
that's where we get into the actual
 

1187
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,350
that's where we get into the actual
activation of the haunt. So, if we look

1188
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
activation of the haunt. So, if we look
 

1189
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,190
activation of the haunt. So, if we look
at uh searing agony here, we see it is a

1190
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
at uh searing agony here, we see it is a
 

1191
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,750
at uh searing agony here, we see it is a
reaction with the mental trait and has

1192
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
reaction with the mental trait and has
 

1193
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,510
reaction with the mental trait and has
the trigger. A living creature

1194
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
the trigger. A living creature
 

1195
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,510
the trigger. A living creature
approaches within 10 ft of the remains

1196
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
approaches within 10 ft of the remains
 

1197
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,789
approaches within 10 ft of the remains
of a victim of the original fire. And

1198
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
of a victim of the original fire. And
 

1199
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,110
of a victim of the original fire. And
the effect is memories of the pain

1200
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
the effect is memories of the pain
 

1201
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,590
the effect is memories of the pain
suffered by the fire's past victims

1202
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
suffered by the fire's past victims
 

1203
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,230
suffered by the fire's past victims
assault the triggering creature's mind.

1204
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,240
assault the triggering creature's mind.
 

1205
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,710
assault the triggering creature's mind.
The creature must attempt a DC25 will

1206
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
The creature must attempt a DC25 will
 

1207
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,269
The creature must attempt a DC25 will
save and the haunt then rolls

1208
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
save and the haunt then rolls
 

1209
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,430
save and the haunt then rolls
initiative. Okay, so uh as soon as that

1210
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
initiative. Okay, so uh as soon as that
 

1211
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,230
initiative. Okay, so uh as soon as that
person walks in within 10 ft of one of

1212
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
person walks in within 10 ft of one of
 

1213
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,789
person walks in within 10 ft of one of
those corpses, the haunt spins its

1214
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
those corpses, the haunt spins its
 

1215
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,669
those corpses, the haunt spins its
reaction. That person must make a will

1216
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
reaction. That person must make a will
 

1217
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,590
reaction. That person must make a will
save DC25.

1218
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
save DC25.
 

1219
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,430
save DC25.
If they succeed, they become quickened

1220
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
If they succeed, they become quickened
 

1221
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,350
If they succeed, they become quickened
one or I'm sorry, not not quickened,

1222
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
one or I'm sorry, not not quickened,
 

1223
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,230
one or I'm sorry, not not quickened,
they become sickened one. Uh if they

1224
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
they become sickened one. Uh if they
 

1225
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,510
they become sickened one. Uh if they
critically succeed, they're not

1226
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
critically succeed, they're not
 

1227
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,310
critically succeed, they're not
affected. If they fail, they are sick in

1228
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320
affected. If they fail, they are sick in
 

1229
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,710
affected. If they fail, they are sick in
two. If they critically fail, they are

1230
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
two. If they critically fail, they are
 

1231
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,430
two. If they critically fail, they are
sick in three and it is offguard for as

1232
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
sick in three and it is offguard for as
 

1233
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,190
sick in three and it is offguard for as
long as it remains within the haunts

1234
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
long as it remains within the haunts
 

1235
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,029
long as it remains within the haunts
area and for three rounds thereafter.

1236
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
area and for three rounds thereafter.
 

1237
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,350
area and for three rounds thereafter.
Okay, so um that is laid out pretty

1238
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
Okay, so um that is laid out pretty
 

1239
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,990
Okay, so um that is laid out pretty
clear. Uh but some of the things that

1240
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
clear. Uh but some of the things that
 

1241
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,669
clear. Uh but some of the things that
people are somewhat interested in are

1242
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
people are somewhat interested in are
 

1243
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,830
people are somewhat interested in are
about initiative. Well, what do we roll

1244
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
about initiative. Well, what do we roll
 

1245
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,669
about initiative. Well, what do we roll
for the initiative? You're going to roll

1246
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
for the initiative? You're going to roll
 

1247
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,310
for the initiative? You're going to roll
stealth. So at the top, stealth bonuses

1248
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
stealth. So at the top, stealth bonuses
 

1249
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,310
stealth. So at the top, stealth bonuses
plus 18. So once you trigger this, it is

1250
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
plus 18. So once you trigger this, it is
 

1251
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,510
plus 18. So once you trigger this, it is
going to uh spin that reaction and

1252
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
going to uh spin that reaction and
 

1253
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,110
going to uh spin that reaction and
you're going to roll you're going to

1254
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
you're going to roll you're going to
 

1255
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,789
you're going to roll you're going to
roll stealth plus 18 for initiative.

1256
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
roll stealth plus 18 for initiative.
 

1257
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,870
roll stealth plus 18 for initiative.
It's slotted in wherever. That means

1258
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
It's slotted in wherever. That means
 

1259
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,149
It's slotted in wherever. That means
it's possible um it there there it is

1260
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
it's possible um it there there it is
 

1261
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,950
it's possible um it there there it is
possible that the turn hat will have

1262
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
possible that the turn hat will have
 

1263
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,029
possible that the turn hat will have
already passed and you know you have to

1264
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
already passed and you know you have to
 

1265
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,230
already passed and you know you have to
wait another round for it to come

1266
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
wait another round for it to come
 

1267
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,950
wait another round for it to come
around. But in a lot of cases this is

1268
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
around. But in a lot of cases this is
 

1269
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,470
around. But in a lot of cases this is
probably the event that causes the party

1270
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,480
probably the event that causes the party
 

1271
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,710
probably the event that causes the party
to roll for initiative. So it won't just

1272
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
to roll for initiative. So it won't just
 

1273
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,190
to roll for initiative. So it won't just
be the haunt that's rolling initiative

1274
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
be the haunt that's rolling initiative
 

1275
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,590
be the haunt that's rolling initiative
and being slotted in. It's everybody's

1276
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
and being slotted in. It's everybody's
 

1277
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,669
and being slotted in. It's everybody's
rolling initiative now. And um and it's

1278
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
rolling initiative now. And um and it's
 

1279
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,510
rolling initiative now. And um and it's
doing stealth for it and it goes in

1280
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
doing stealth for it and it goes in
 

1281
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,549
doing stealth for it and it goes in
wherever wherever makes sense.

1282
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
wherever wherever makes sense.
 

1283
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,710
wherever wherever makes sense.
Now another thing that uh sometimes

1284
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
Now another thing that uh sometimes
 

1285
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,389
Now another thing that uh sometimes
comes up is well how many times does it

1286
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
comes up is well how many times does it
 

1287
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,070
comes up is well how many times does it
do this reaction? Does it keep doing

1288
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
do this reaction? Does it keep doing
 

1289
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,269
do this reaction? Does it keep doing
this this reaction uh every time

1290
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
this this reaction uh every time
 

1291
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,990
this this reaction uh every time
somebody steps within 10 ft of it? Uh

1292
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
somebody steps within 10 ft of it? Uh
 

1293
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,230
somebody steps within 10 ft of it? Uh
no. on these hazards. The reaction is

1294
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
no. on these hazards. The reaction is
 

1295
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,430
no. on these hazards. The reaction is
the initial trigger that sets it off. In

1296
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440
the initial trigger that sets it off. In
 

1297
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,990
the initial trigger that sets it off. In
the case of a simple hazard, it's a one

1298
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
the case of a simple hazard, it's a one
 

1299
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,070
the case of a simple hazard, it's a one
and done again like a landmine. In the

1300
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
and done again like a landmine. In the
 

1301
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,549
and done again like a landmine. In the
case of a complex hazard like this one,

1302
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
case of a complex hazard like this one,
 

1303
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,710
case of a complex hazard like this one,
it uh does it once. It triggers you to

1304
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
it uh does it once. It triggers you to
 

1305
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,350
it uh does it once. It triggers you to
roll initiative and then it goes into

1306
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
roll initiative and then it goes into
 

1307
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,230
roll initiative and then it goes into
its routine. So, let's take a look at

1308
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
its routine. So, let's take a look at
 

1309
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,669
its routine. So, let's take a look at
its routine. Says routine one action.

1310
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
its routine. Says routine one action.
 

1311
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,149
its routine. Says routine one action.
Phantom flames rage across the haunted

1312
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,159
Phantom flames rage across the haunted
 

1313
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,350
Phantom flames rage across the haunted
area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each

1314
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each
 

1315
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,909
area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each
living creature within the area. Uh,

1316
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
living creature within the area. Uh,
 

1317
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,870
living creature within the area. Uh,
DC23 basic will save. Undead creatures

1318
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
DC23 basic will save. Undead creatures
 

1319
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,269
DC23 basic will save. Undead creatures
in the area are infused with flames for

1320
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
in the area are infused with flames for
 

1321
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,750
in the area are infused with flames for
the following round. They gain the fire

1322
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:55,760
the following round. They gain the fire
 

1323
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,630
the following round. They gain the fire
trait and immunity to fire and all their

1324
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
trait and immunity to fire and all their
 

1325
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,549
trait and immunity to fire and all their
attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire

1326
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire
 

1327
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,710
attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire
damage. Objects in the area are

1328
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
damage. Objects in the area are
 

1329
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,669
damage. Objects in the area are
unaffected. Okay. So, if a player gets

1330
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
unaffected. Okay. So, if a player gets
 

1331
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,470
unaffected. Okay. So, if a player gets
within uh so close to it, it's going to

1332
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
within uh so close to it, it's going to
 

1333
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,269
within uh so close to it, it's going to
initially trigger that reaction and then

1334
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
initially trigger that reaction and then
 

1335
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,310
initially trigger that reaction and then
when it comes to the eternal flames turn

1336
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
when it comes to the eternal flames turn
 

1337
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,110
when it comes to the eternal flames turn
in the initiative order, it's going to

1338
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,120
in the initiative order, it's going to
 

1339
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,669
in the initiative order, it's going to
have one action. Now, the parenthetical

1340
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
have one action. Now, the parenthetical
 

1341
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,310
have one action. Now, the parenthetical
one action means it has one action to

1342
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
one action means it has one action to
 

1343
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,190
one action means it has one action to
spend. Some haunts and hazards could

1344
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
spend. Some haunts and hazards could
 

1345
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,590
spend. Some haunts and hazards could
have three actions. They could have six

1346
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
have three actions. They could have six
 

1347
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,510
have three actions. They could have six
actions. They could have who knows how

1348
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
actions. They could have who knows how
 

1349
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,230
actions. They could have who knows how
many actions, but uh they're not

1350
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
many actions, but uh they're not
 

1351
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,830
many actions, but uh they're not
designed like creatures where the

1352
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
designed like creatures where the
 

1353
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,310
designed like creatures where the
assumption is three actions. Instead, it

1354
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,320
assumption is three actions. Instead, it
 

1355
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,389
assumption is three actions. Instead, it
spells it out here as one action and it

1356
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:38,399
spells it out here as one action and it
 

1357
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,789
spells it out here as one action and it
spins that one action on causing the

1358
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
spins that one action on causing the
 

1359
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,549
spins that one action on causing the
phantom flames to rage across the

1360
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
phantom flames to rage across the
 

1361
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,750
phantom flames to rage across the
haunted area. Um,

1362
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
haunted area. Um,
 

1363
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,950
haunted area. Um,
so it has one action and it spins it,

1364
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
so it has one action and it spins it,
 

1365
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,470
so it has one action and it spins it,
which means that this is the only thing

1366
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
which means that this is the only thing
 

1367
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,389
which means that this is the only thing
it does on its turn in initiative and it

1368
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
it does on its turn in initiative and it
 

1369
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,110
it does on its turn in initiative and it
does it one time. The one action doesn't

1370
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
does it one time. The one action doesn't
 

1371
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,430
does it one time. The one action doesn't
mean that the phantom flames costs one

1372
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,440
mean that the phantom flames costs one
 

1373
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,950
mean that the phantom flames costs one
action. Has three actions. Therefore, it

1374
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
action. Has three actions. Therefore, it
 

1375
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,149
action. Has three actions. Therefore, it
would do this three times. No, it has

1376
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
would do this three times. No, it has
 

1377
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,909
would do this three times. No, it has
one action. This costs one action.

1378
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
one action. This costs one action.
 

1379
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,909
one action. This costs one action.
Causes the phantom flames to to uh to

1380
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
Causes the phantom flames to to uh to
 

1381
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,350
Causes the phantom flames to to uh to
envelop this area. Now, the one thing

1382
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
envelop this area. Now, the one thing
 

1383
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,710
envelop this area. Now, the one thing
about this particular hazard that I

1384
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
about this particular hazard that I
 

1385
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,510
about this particular hazard that I
don't really like is it makes references

1386
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,520
don't really like is it makes references
 

1387
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,149
don't really like is it makes references
to quote unquote the haunted area, but I

1388
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:20,159
to quote unquote the haunted area, but I
 

1389
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,070
to quote unquote the haunted area, but I
don't really see anywhere in the text

1390
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
don't really see anywhere in the text
 

1391
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,110
don't really see anywhere in the text
that it very clearly defines what the

1392
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
that it very clearly defines what the
 

1393
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,549
that it very clearly defines what the
haunted area is. Uh, I personally am

1394
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
haunted area is. Uh, I personally am
 

1395
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,510
haunted area is. Uh, I personally am
going to take the haunted area to be uh

1396
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,520
going to take the haunted area to be uh
 

1397
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,830
going to take the haunted area to be uh
anywhere within 10 ft of the charred

1398
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
anywhere within 10 ft of the charred
 

1399
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,750
anywhere within 10 ft of the charred
remains of any of the victims of the

1400
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760
remains of any of the victims of the
 

1401
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,389
remains of any of the victims of the
original fire because uh that's what the

1402
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
original fire because uh that's what the
 

1403
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,430
original fire because uh that's what the
trigger is. And that is the only thing I

1404
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
trigger is. And that is the only thing I
 

1405
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,230
trigger is. And that is the only thing I
see in the this text that talks about

1406
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
see in the this text that talks about
 

1407
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,190
see in the this text that talks about
area. Um, and it it I could just be

1408
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
area. Um, and it it I could just be
 

1409
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,549
area. Um, and it it I could just be
blind. Maybe there's something there

1410
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
blind. Maybe there's something there
 

1411
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,990
blind. Maybe there's something there
that I'm missing. If there is, let me

1412
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
that I'm missing. If there is, let me
 

1413
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,230
that I'm missing. If there is, let me
know. Uh, otherwise it could just be up

1414
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,240
know. Uh, otherwise it could just be up
 

1415
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,789
know. Uh, otherwise it could just be up
to your GM to, you know, make a

1416
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:56,799
to your GM to, you know, make a
 

1417
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,269
to your GM to, you know, make a
determination that this entire cave,

1418
00:31:59,269 --> 00:31:59,279
determination that this entire cave,
 

1419
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,750
determination that this entire cave,
this room, whatever, you know, it is

00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
this room, whatever, you know, it is
 

1421
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,590
this room, whatever, you know, it is
this building that is haunted. And we're

1422
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
this building that is haunted. And we're
 

1423
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,990
this building that is haunted. And we're
going to call this the haunted area. But

1424
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
going to call this the haunted area. But
 

1425
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,430
going to call this the haunted area. But
mechanically speaking, I don't see

1426
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
mechanically speaking, I don't see
 

1427
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,190
mechanically speaking, I don't see
anything else here that uh clearly

1428
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
anything else here that uh clearly
 

1429
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,190
anything else here that uh clearly
defines what the haunted area is. Um,

1430
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
defines what the haunted area is. Um,
 

1431
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,710
defines what the haunted area is. Um,
keep in mind that these are phantom

1432
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
keep in mind that these are phantom
 

1433
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,710
keep in mind that these are phantom
flames. They're not, you know, actual

1434
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:16,720
flames. They're not, you know, actual
 

1435
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,190
flames. They're not, you know, actual
physical flames. Uh, so you're making

1436
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
physical flames. Uh, so you're making
 

1437
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,070
physical flames. Uh, so you're making
basic will saves for these and because

1438
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
basic will saves for these and because
 

1439
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,389
basic will saves for these and because
they are are fantasmal nature objects

1440
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
they are are fantasmal nature objects
 

1441
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,950
they are are fantasmal nature objects
are not affected. Now, another question

1442
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:26,960
are not affected. Now, another question
 

1443
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,110
are not affected. Now, another question
that sometimes comes up is with regards

1444
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
that sometimes comes up is with regards
 

1445
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,830
that sometimes comes up is with regards
to disable uh once it moves into its

1446
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
to disable uh once it moves into its
 

1447
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,350
to disable uh once it moves into its
routine, is it too late to disable it?

1448
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
routine, is it too late to disable it?
 

1449
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,710
routine, is it too late to disable it?
Um, and the answer is no. Um, as long as

1450
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
Um, and the answer is no. Um, as long as
 

1451
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,750
Um, and the answer is no. Um, as long as
the haunt is active in any form, uh, you

1452
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
the haunt is active in any form, uh, you
 

1453
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,310
the haunt is active in any form, uh, you
can attempt to disable it, not just

1454
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
can attempt to disable it, not just
 

1455
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,029
can attempt to disable it, not just
before it goes off, so to speak. So, you

1456
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,039
before it goes off, so to speak. So, you
 

1457
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,310
before it goes off, so to speak. So, you
go into a combat encounter, you're going

1458
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,320
go into a combat encounter, you're going
 

1459
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,070
go into a combat encounter, you're going
to be fighting some other in this area,

1460
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
to be fighting some other in this area,
 

1461
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,990
to be fighting some other in this area,
probably some skeletons, whatnot.

1462
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
probably some skeletons, whatnot.
 

1463
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,310
probably some skeletons, whatnot.
They're going to be buffed by this uh by

1464
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,320
They're going to be buffed by this uh by
 

1465
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,190
They're going to be buffed by this uh by
by this area. You're going to be dealing

1466
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
by this area. You're going to be dealing
 

1467
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,149
by this area. You're going to be dealing
with uh suffering damage. On your turn,

1468
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
with uh suffering damage. On your turn,
 

1469
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,430
with uh suffering damage. On your turn,
you can take your actions. And if those

1470
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
you can take your actions. And if those
 

1471
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,830
you can take your actions. And if those
can be those can be attacking the the

1472
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:05,840
can be those can be attacking the the
 

1473
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,710
can be those can be attacking the the
undead creatures. They can be making uh

1474
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,720
undead creatures. They can be making uh
 

1475
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,950
undead creatures. They can be making uh
disabled checks, what have you as normal

1476
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
disabled checks, what have you as normal
 

1477
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,630
disabled checks, what have you as normal
in encounter mode. Um but yeah, you can

1478
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
in encounter mode. Um but yeah, you can
 

1479
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,870
in encounter mode. Um but yeah, you can
continue to try to make those disabled

1480
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
continue to try to make those disabled
 

1481
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,190
continue to try to make those disabled
checks. And if you do make those uh

1482
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
checks. And if you do make those uh
 

1483
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,750
checks. And if you do make those uh
three successes in the middle of combat

1484
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
three successes in the middle of combat
 

1485
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,509
three successes in the middle of combat
is going to shut down the haunt. The

1486
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
is going to shut down the haunt. The
 

1487
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,990
is going to shut down the haunt. The
haunt just ceases to be active. But, uh,

1488
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,000
haunt just ceases to be active. But, uh,
 

1489
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,590
haunt just ceases to be active. But, uh,
as mentioned before, the weird thing

1490
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,600
as mentioned before, the weird thing
 

1491
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,389
as mentioned before, the weird thing
about haunts is they're never

1492
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
about haunts is they're never
 

1493
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,470
about haunts is they're never
permanently, uh, disabled and destroyed,

1494
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:36,480
permanently, uh, disabled and destroyed,
 

1495
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,950
permanently, uh, disabled and destroyed,
so to speak, unless a piece of

1496
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
so to speak, unless a piece of
 

1497
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,509
so to speak, unless a piece of
unfinished business is dealt with. And

1498
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
unfinished business is dealt with. And
 

1499
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,950
unfinished business is dealt with. And
so, we see at the very bottom here, it

1500
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
so, we see at the very bottom here, it
 

1501
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,110
so, we see at the very bottom here, it
says, "The flames cease one minute after

1502
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
says, "The flames cease one minute after
 

1503
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,430
says, "The flames cease one minute after
all living creatures leave the area, but

1504
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
all living creatures leave the area, but
 

1505
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,470
all living creatures leave the area, but
after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer

1506
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer
 

1507
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,389
after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer
up, and the haunt is ready to trigger

1508
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
up, and the haunt is ready to trigger
 

1509
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,830
up, and the haunt is ready to trigger
again."

1510
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,840
again."
 

1511
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,549
again."
So, even if you succeed on these these

1512
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:56,559
So, even if you succeed on these these
 

1513
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,110
So, even if you succeed on these these
three uh checks to disable it, one hour

1514
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
three uh checks to disable it, one hour
 

1515
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,590
three uh checks to disable it, one hour
later, it's going to become active

1516
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
later, it's going to become active
 

1517
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,389
later, it's going to become active
again. And if somebody comes within 10

1518
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
again. And if somebody comes within 10
 

1519
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,190
again. And if somebody comes within 10
ft of those bodies, uh they're going to

1520
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
ft of those bodies, uh they're going to
 

1521
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,629
ft of those bodies, uh they're going to
trigger the searing agony uh reaction

1522
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
trigger the searing agony uh reaction
 

1523
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,230
trigger the searing agony uh reaction
and then it's going to go into encounter

1524
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
and then it's going to go into encounter
 

1525
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,750
and then it's going to go into encounter
mode and it's going to or go into

1526
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
mode and it's going to or go into
 

1527
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,270
mode and it's going to or go into
initiative and it's going to roll

1528
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
initiative and it's going to roll
 

1529
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,629
initiative and it's going to roll
initiative using stealth just like

1530
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
initiative using stealth just like
 

1531
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,069
initiative using stealth just like
before and it just keeps repeating

1532
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
before and it just keeps repeating
 

1533
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,510
before and it just keeps repeating
itself.

1534
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
itself.
 

1535
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,589
itself.
So, the question becomes, well, uh, if

1536
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
So, the question becomes, well, uh, if
 

1537
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,990
So, the question becomes, well, uh, if
the only way to deal with a haunt is

1538
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,000
the only way to deal with a haunt is
 

1539
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,990
the only way to deal with a haunt is
through resolving the quote unquote

1540
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
through resolving the quote unquote
 

1541
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,829
through resolving the quote unquote
unfinished business, well, how do we do

1542
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
unfinished business, well, how do we do
 

1543
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,389
unfinished business, well, how do we do
that with Eternal Flame?

1544
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
that with Eternal Flame?
 

1545
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,950
that with Eternal Flame?
Some haunts might spell it out. Uh, more

1546
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
Some haunts might spell it out. Uh, more
 

1547
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,270
Some haunts might spell it out. Uh, more
often you would have like an adventure

1548
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
often you would have like an adventure
 

1549
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,230
often you would have like an adventure
module, an adventure path that in the

1550
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
module, an adventure path that in the
 

1551
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,349
module, an adventure path that in the
body descriptive text of that room, it

1552
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
body descriptive text of that room, it
 

1553
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,030
body descriptive text of that room, it
might tell you what the unfinished

1554
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
might tell you what the unfinished
 

1555
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,790
might tell you what the unfinished
business is and how to resolve it

1556
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
business is and how to resolve it
 

1557
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,589
business is and how to resolve it
outside of this stat block. This stat

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,510

out of GM course, so it doesn't have all

1562
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
out of GM course, so it doesn't have all
 

1563
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,909
out of GM course, so it doesn't have all

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,190
that you would get in a full adventure.
Uh, beyond that, it could just be up to

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
Uh, beyond that, it could just be up to
 

1569
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,230
Uh, beyond that, it could just be up to
the GM to make a judgment call on this.

Uh, now when I look at the description,

1572
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
Uh, now when I look at the description,
 

1573
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,589
Uh, now when I look at the description,
the last sentence says uh, and I guess

1574
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599
the last sentence says uh, and I guess
 

1575
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,150
the last sentence says uh, and I guess
the very last end of that last sentence,

1576
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
the very last end of that last sentence,
 

1577
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,150
the very last end of that last sentence,
it refers to them as being quote unquote

1578
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
it refers to them as being quote unquote
 

1579
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,790
it refers to them as being quote unquote
unavvened souls that are burning with

1580
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
unavvened souls that are burning with
 

1581
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,470
unavvened souls that are burning with
rage. So, uh, in the absence of any

1582
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,480
rage. So, uh, in the absence of any
 

1583
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,510
rage. So, uh, in the absence of any
clear text, as a GM, I would probably

1584
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
clear text, as a GM, I would probably
 

1585
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,670
clear text, as a GM, I would probably
say if a if a player wanted to do a, um,

1586
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
say if a if a player wanted to do a, um,
 

1587
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,910
say if a if a player wanted to do a, um,
a recall knowledge and figure out, well,

1588
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
a recall knowledge and figure out, well,
 

1589
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,710
a recall knowledge and figure out, well,
how can I permanently put this to rest?

1590
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,720
how can I permanently put this to rest?
 

1591
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,750
how can I permanently put this to rest?
Well, you're going to have to adventure

1592
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
Well, you're going to have to adventure
 

1593
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,190
Well, you're going to have to adventure
these these souls. So, you're going to

1594
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
these these souls. So, you're going to
 

1595
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,310
these these souls. So, you're going to
have to find the person, creature,

1596
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
have to find the person, creature,
 

1597
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,310
have to find the person, creature,
monster, whatever that was responsible

1598
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,320
monster, whatever that was responsible
 

1599
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,710
monster, whatever that was responsible
for these flames, and you're going to

1600
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
for these flames, and you're going to
 

1601
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,870
for these flames, and you're going to
have to bring them to justice, whatever

1602
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
have to bring them to justice, whatever
 

1603
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,390
have to bring them to justice, whatever
justice may mean, to finally put these

1604
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
justice may mean, to finally put these
 

1605
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,270
justice may mean, to finally put these
souls to rest. And if those souls feel

1606
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
souls to rest. And if those souls feel
 

1607
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,310
souls to rest. And if those souls feel
like they have been avenged, then this

1608
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
like they have been avenged, then this
 

1609
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,190
like they have been avenged, then this
eternal flame will no longer be a haunt.

1610
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
eternal flame will no longer be a haunt.
 

1611
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,230
eternal flame will no longer be a haunt.
You will have purified that area, so to

1612
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
You will have purified that area, so to
 

1613
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,790
You will have purified that area, so to
speak. It will no longer be a problem.

1614
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
speak. It will no longer be a problem.
 

1615
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,069
speak. It will no longer be a problem.
Uh, so that's haunts in uh, I guess a

1616
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
Uh, so that's haunts in uh, I guess a
 

1617
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,510
Uh, so that's haunts in uh, I guess a
pretty big nutshell at this point.

1618
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,520
pretty big nutshell at this point.
 

1619
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,470
pretty big nutshell at this point.
Sorry, I have a tendency to ramble, but

1620
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
Sorry, I have a tendency to ramble, but
 

1621
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,230
Sorry, I have a tendency to ramble, but
a haunt is just a type of a hazard. It

1622
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
a haunt is just a type of a hazard. It
 

1623
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,829
a haunt is just a type of a hazard. It
functions mechanically like any other

1624
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
functions mechanically like any other
 

1625
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,589
functions mechanically like any other
hazard. I think of them as spooky traps.

1626
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
hazard. I think of them as spooky traps.
 

1627
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,510
hazard. I think of them as spooky traps.
Uh, and that would be a trap that does

1628
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
Uh, and that would be a trap that does
 

1629
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,069
Uh, and that would be a trap that does
not have physical elements and physical

1630
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:24,079
not have physical elements and physical
 

1631
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,150
not have physical elements and physical
danger, but fantasmal, spectral, perhaps

1632
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
danger, but fantasmal, spectral, perhaps
 

1633
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,829
danger, but fantasmal, spectral, perhaps
even psionic, psychic or illusory

even psionic, psychic or illusory
 

1635
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,349
even psionic, psychic or illusory
dangers. Um, if any of this is not

1636
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
dangers. Um, if any of this is not
 

1637

dangers. Um, if any of this is not
clear, if you have any questions, then
