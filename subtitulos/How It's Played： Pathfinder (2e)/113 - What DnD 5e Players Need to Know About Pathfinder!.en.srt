00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,830
every saving throw you're going to roll
every

162
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
every
 

163
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,429
every
poison everything uses traits and these

164
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:37,439
poison everything uses traits and these
 

165
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,990
poison everything uses traits and these
traits are great because they save a lot

166
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
traits are great because they save a lot
 

167
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,390
traits are great because they save a lot
of uh print space on in the books

168
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,400
of uh print space on in the books
 

169
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,830
of uh print space on in the books
because if you know how a trait works

170
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
because if you know how a trait works
 

171
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,910
because if you know how a trait works
you don't have to repeat the text for

172
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:46,920
you don't have to repeat the text for
 

173
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,030
you don't have to repeat the text for
that for that piece in every single

174
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
that for that piece in every single
 

175
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,270
that for that piece in every single
thing it applies to but uh a lot of

176
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,280
thing it applies to but uh a lot of
 

177
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,229
thing it applies to but uh a lot of
these traits really kind of um really

178
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
these traits really kind of um really
 

179
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,309
these traits really kind of um really
kind of modify the way things work in

180
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
kind of modify the way things work in
 

181
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,670
kind of modify the way things work in
the game uh so if you're especially if

182
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
the game uh so if you're especially if
 

183

you're a spellcaster make sure you look
 

185
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,789
you're a spellcaster make sure you look
up what the traits for that spell

186
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
up what the traits for that spell
 

187
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,429
up what the traits for that spell
actually mean and do before you cast

188

that spell uh if you are going to cast a
spell and it has the incapacity trait

192
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:14,680
spell and it has the incapacity trait
 

193
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,430
spell and it has the incapacity trait
make sure you look up incapacitate and

194
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
make sure you look up incapacitate and
 

195
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,510
make sure you look up incapacitate and
know how that's going to uh uh alter or

196
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,520
know how that's going to uh uh alter or
 

197
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,790
know how that's going to uh uh alter or
change the expected effects of that

edition so in Pathfinder there are four

240
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
edition so in Pathfinder there are four
 

241
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,670
edition so in Pathfinder there are four
degrees of success which are going to be

242
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:22,680
degrees of success which are going to be
 

243
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,469
degrees of success which are going to be
very familiar to D and players you know

244
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:25,479
very familiar to D and players you know
 

245
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,950
very familiar to D and players you know
your critical success your regular

246
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
your critical success your regular
 

247
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,350
your critical success your regular
success your regular failure and your

248
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,360
success your regular failure and your
 

249
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,909
success your regular failure and your
critical failure uh but what may be

250
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
critical failure uh but what may be
 

251
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,029
critical failure uh but what may be
different is those four degrees of

252
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:34,039
different is those four degrees of
 

253
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,590
different is those four degrees of
success apply to pretty much

254
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
success apply to pretty much
 

255
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,629
success apply to pretty much
everything uh pretty much every skill

256
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
everything uh pretty much every skill
 

257
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,430
everything uh pretty much every skill
you you use is going to have these four

258
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
you you use is going to have these four
 

259
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,230
you you use is going to have these four
degrees of success so yes you can

260
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,240
degrees of success so yes you can
 

261
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,909
degrees of success so yes you can
critically succeed on your skills and

262
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
critically succeed on your skills and
 

263
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,510
critically succeed on your skills and
critically fail at your skills as well

264
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:50,520
critically fail at your skills as well
 

265
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,629
critically fail at your skills as well
anytime you roll a saving throw there

266
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
anytime you roll a saving throw there
 

267
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,189
anytime you roll a saving throw there
are going to be those same four degrees

268
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199
are going to be those same four degrees
 

269
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,990
are going to be those same four degrees
of success so you can critically succeed

270
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
of success so you can critically succeed
 

271
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,430
of success so you can critically succeed
and critically and critically fail on

272
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,440
and critically and critically fail on
 

273
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,350
and critically and critically fail on
your saving throws

274
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
your saving throws
 

275
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,390
your saving throws
and uh one of the main reasons why you

276
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,400
and uh one of the main reasons why you
 

277
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,510
and uh one of the main reasons why you
should understand that is because the

278
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:06,520
should understand that is because the
 

279
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,350
should understand that is because the
way you determine if your action is a

280
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,360
way you determine if your action is a
 

281
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,029
way you determine if your action is a
critical success or a critical failure

282
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:12,039
critical success or a critical failure
 

283
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,830
critical success or a critical failure
is a little bit different and Pathfinder

284
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:14,840
is a little bit different and Pathfinder
 

285
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,550
is a little bit different and Pathfinder
than it is in dndd 5e uh so you may be

286
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
than it is in dndd 5e uh so you may be
 

287
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,430
than it is in dndd 5e uh so you may be
accustomed to every time you roll a

288
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,440
accustomed to every time you roll a
 

289
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,710
accustomed to every time you roll a
natural 20 on the die critical hit

290
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
natural 20 on the die critical hit
 

291
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,110
natural 20 on the die critical hit
critical success every time you roll

292
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
critical success every time you roll
 

293
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,110
critical success every time you roll
natural one critical failure uh uh

294
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
natural one critical failure uh uh
 

295
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,830
natural one critical failure uh uh
critical Miss however you want to put

296
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:28,840
critical Miss however you want to put
 

297
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,350
critical Miss however you want to put
that

298
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
that
 

299
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,110
that
but in um in Pathfinder there is one

300
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,120
but in um in Pathfinder there is one
 

301
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,710
but in um in Pathfinder there is one
more very important way that you can

302
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:37,720
more very important way that you can
 

303
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,710
more very important way that you can
score a critical success or a critical

304
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,720
score a critical success or a critical
 

305
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,189
score a critical success or a critical
failure and that is by hitting a DC that

306
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:44,199
failure and that is by hitting a DC that
 

307
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,550
failure and that is by hitting a DC that
is 10 higher or 10 lower than the

308
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
is 10 higher or 10 lower than the
 

309
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,390
is 10 higher or 10 lower than the
regular DC so for example if you're

310
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,400
regular DC so for example if you're
 

311
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,790
regular DC so for example if you're
trying to hit a DC 15 you roll a natural

312
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
trying to hit a DC 15 you roll a natural
 

313
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,390
trying to hit a DC 15 you roll a natural
19 but your modified total is a 25

314
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
19 but your modified total is a 25
 

315
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,830
19 but your modified total is a 25
that's 10 more than the target DC so

316
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
that's 10 more than the target DC so
 

317
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,869
that's 10 more than the target DC so
that's a critical hit or a critical

318
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:05,879
that's a critical hit or a critical
 

319
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,469
that's a critical hit or a critical
success if you're doing a Skiller and

320
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:07,479
success if you're doing a Skiller and
 

321
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,550
success if you're doing a Skiller and

roll a natural one maybe roll a natural

326
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:13,639
roll a natural one maybe roll a natural

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,350
roll a natural one maybe roll a natural
two or natural three and your final

328
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,360
two or natural three and your final
 

329
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,589
two or natural three and your final
total is 10 below what the target number

330
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
total is 10 below what the target number
 

331
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,309
total is 10 below what the target number
is you get a critical failure so this is

332
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:23,319
is you get a critical failure so this is
 

333
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,070
is you get a critical failure so this is
this is great not just in the sense of

334
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,080
this is great not just in the sense of
 

335
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,589
this is great not just in the sense of
it gives you more ways to critically

336
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:26,599
it gives you more ways to critically
 

337
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,869
it gives you more ways to critically
succeed and critical fail but it also

338
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:28,879
succeed and critical fail but it also
 

339
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,029
succeed and critical fail but it also
makes every plus one uh or minus one on

340
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
makes every plus one uh or minus one on
 

341
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,869
makes every plus one uh or minus one on
any role much more significant because

342
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:35,879
any role much more significant because
 

343
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,189
any role much more significant because
you're not just increasing your odds of

344
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
you're not just increasing your odds of
 

345
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,909
you're not just increasing your odds of
success you're increasing your odds of

346
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:40,919
success you're increasing your odds of
 

347
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,469
success you're increasing your odds of
critical succeeding and you're

348
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:43,479
critical succeeding and you're
 

349
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,990
critical succeeding and you're
decreasing your odds of having a

350
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,000
decreasing your odds of having a
 

351
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,909
decreasing your odds of having a
critical failure so um that makes every

352
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:48,919
critical failure so um that makes every
 

353
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,790

natural 20 is you you add your bonus to

372
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:18,039
natural 20 is you you add your bonus to
 

373
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,189
natural 20 is you you add your bonus to
it and you compare that bonus that final

00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:20,199
it and you compare that bonus that final
 

375
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,950
it and you compare that bonus that final
total to the target number and then you

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:23,960
total to the target number and then you
 

377
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,110
total to the target number and then you
increase it by one degree of success so

378
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
increase it by one degree of success so
 

379
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,469
increase it by one degree of success so
say you're trying to hit a target number

380
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
say you're trying to hit a target number
 

381
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,270
say you're trying to hit a target number
of 25 you're roll a natural 20 and

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
of 25 you're roll a natural 20 and
 

383
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,269
of 25 you're roll a natural 20 and
you've got a plus n to your to as a

you've got a plus n to your to as a

9 is 29 so 29 versus a target number of

00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:41,800
9 is 29 so 29 versus a target number of
 

389
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,990
9 is 29 so 29 versus a target number of
25 that would be a normal success

390
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,000
25 that would be a normal success
 

391
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,070
25 that would be a normal success
normally but because you roll a natural

392
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,080
normally but because you roll a natural
 

393
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,670
normally but because you roll a natural
20 you increase it one step to a to a

394
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
20 you increase it one step to a to a
 

395
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,509
20 you increase it one step to a to a
critical success but if the target

396
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:52,519
critical success but if the target
 

397
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,470
critical success but if the target
number was say 30 and you roll a natural

398
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,480
number was say 30 and you roll a natural
 

399
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,829
number was say 30 and you roll a natural
20 and you add your plus n bonus to a 29

400
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:58,839
20 and you add your plus n bonus to a 29
 

401
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,949
20 and you add your plus n bonus to a 29
that would normally be a failure but

402
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:01,959
that would normally be a failure but
 

403
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,069
that would normally be a failure but
because you wrote a natural 20 it

404
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:04,079
because you wrote a natural 20 it
 

405
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,069
because you wrote a natural 20 it
increases at one step from failure to a

406
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:07,079
increases at one step from failure to a
 

407
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,430
increases at one step from failure to a
regular success not a critical success

408
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,440
regular success not a critical success
 

409
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,509
regular success not a critical success
so this does add a little more

410
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:12,519
so this does add a little more
 

411
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,990
so this does add a little more

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,069
is how we calculate critical

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,040
Pathfinder is you roll your damage and
 

469
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,150
Pathfinder is you roll your damage and
you multiply that final damage by

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,110
you multiply that final damage by

481
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,550
get your double damage on a critical hit
but it is a little different because in

482
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
but it is a little different because in
 

483
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,910
but it is a little different because in
Pathfinder what you do is you just

484
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:52,920
Pathfinder what you do is you just
 

485
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,030
Pathfinder what you do is you just
pretend you didn't roll a critical

486

pretend you didn't roll a critical
 

487

pretend you didn't roll a critical
success just pretend you didn't roll a

488
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
success just pretend you didn't roll a
 

489
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,550

critical success roll it like it was a
 

491
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,269
critical success roll it like it was a
regular success and then double it uh so

492
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
regular success and then double it uh so

00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:57,320
the beginning of this video I said that
 

535
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,870
the beginning of this video I said that
I wasn't going to go into every

I wasn't going to go into every

will go into uh a little bit of an

00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
your
 

567
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,269
your
traits there are two traits to know and

traits there are two traits to know and
 

569
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,870
traits there are two traits to know and
those are deadly and fatal the deadly

570
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
those are deadly and fatal the deadly
 

571
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,230
those are deadly and fatal the deadly
and fatal traits that belong to weapons

and fatal traits that belong to weapons
 

573
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,790
and fatal traits that belong to weapons
modify how they function when they

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:43,800
modify how they function when they

modify how they function when they
deliver Critical Hits so if you're using

576
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:46,920
deliver Critical Hits so if you're using
 

577
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,030
deliver Critical Hits so if you're using
a weapon that has one of those two

578
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,040
a weapon that has one of those two
 

579

a weapon that has one of those two
traits you're going to want to make sure

580
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,320
traits you're going to want to make sure
 

581
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,949
traits you're going to want to make sure
that you read those traits and

582
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
that you read those traits and
 

583
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,389
that you read those traits and
understand how they modify this the good

584
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:53,399
understand how they modify this the good
 

585
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,230
understand how they modify this the good
news is is going to in both those cases

586
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,240
news is is going to in both those cases
 

587
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,509
news is is going to in both those cases
is going to increase the damage but if

588
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:58,519
is going to increase the damage but if
 

589
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,430
is going to increase the damage but if
you don't have a weapon that has the one

590
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:02,440
you don't have a weapon that has the one

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,430
you don't have a weapon that has the one
of these traits like deadly or fatal uh

the general rule thumb is going to work

594
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:07,800
the general rule thumb is going to work
 

595
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,990
the general rule thumb is going to work
in most cases pretend you did not roll a

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,310
in most cases pretend you did not roll a
critical hit just roll it normal add

598
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
critical hit just roll it normal add
 

599
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,069

everything together multiply it by

everything together multiply it by
 

601
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,949
everything together multiply it by
two so um while we're still talking

602
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
two so um while we're still talking
 

603
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,550
two so um while we're still talking
about uh our our checks and our our four

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
about uh our our checks and our our four

degrees of success and whatnot we should
 

607
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,430
degrees of success and whatnot we should
probably talk a little bit about DCS or

608
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,440
probably talk a little bit about DCS or
 

609
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,590

top of that actions description and
those errors tell you how many actions

886
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
those errors tell you how many actions
 

887

those errors tell you how many actions
you have to spend to do the thing so for

888

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,909
you have to spend to do the thing so for
example most spells are going to have

890
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:00,919
example most spells are going to have
 

891
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,190
example most spells are going to have
two little arrows at the top which means

892
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
two little arrows at the top which means
 

893
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,909
two little arrows at the top which means
it costs two actions to cast that spell

894
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:06,919
it costs two actions to cast that spell
 

895
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:07,950
it costs two actions to cast that spell
and so this gives you a lot of

and so this gives you a lot of
 

897
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,669
and so this gives you a lot of
flexibility in how you can you can

operate on every
turn um but there are some particular

902
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
turn um but there are some particular
 

903
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,390
turn um but there are some particular
things I want to make sure I cover here

904
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,400
things I want to make sure I cover here
 

905
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,909
things I want to make sure I cover here
uh first is multiple

906
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:18,919
uh first is multiple
 

907
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,270
uh first is multiple
attacks so yes you got three XS a turn

908
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,280
attacks so yes you got three XS a turn
 

909
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,789

to your enemy you can spend all three of
your actions to make three attacks but

914
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
your actions to make three attacks but
 

915
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,510
your actions to make three attacks but
there is was known as the multiple

916
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:30,520
there is was known as the multiple
 

917
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,789

attack after the first is going to
 

921
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,310
attack after the first is going to
suffer a penalty so your first attack

922
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,320
suffer a penalty so your first attack
 

923
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,510
suffer a penalty so your first attack
every turn whether it's your first

924

per turn just make sure that that second
 

941
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,350
per turn just make sure that that second
attack you're suffering a neg five and

942
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,360
attack you're suffering a neg five and

the third attack you're suffering a -10
 

945
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,750
the third attack you're suffering a -10
uh the key exception to this is again

946
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
uh the key exception to this is again
 

947
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,029
uh the key exception to this is again
know your traits some weapons uh have

know your traits some weapons uh have
 

949

know your traits some weapons uh have
the agile trait so these are typically

agile trait reduces that multiple attack
 

955
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,750

about movement and this is a little bit
 

1167
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,950
about movement and this is a little bit
of a point of contion that a lot of my 5

players don't like but I think um they

1170
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
players don't like but I think um they
 

1171
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,190
players don't like but I think um they
warm up too once they kind of understand

1172
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,200
warm up too once they kind of understand
 

1173
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,909

how this action economy works and that

1174
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:06,919
how this action economy works and that
 

1175
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,190
how this action economy works and that
is in Pathfinder you cannot split your

1176
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,200
is in Pathfinder you cannot split your
 

1177
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,789
is in Pathfinder you cannot split your
movement so you may be used to if you

1178
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
movement so you may be used to if you
 

1179
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,710
movement so you may be used to if you
can move 30 feet in a turn you can move

1180
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:15,720
can move 30 feet in a turn you can move
 

1181
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,669
can move 30 feet in a turn you can move
15 feet attack somebody move 15 more

1182
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
15 feet attack somebody move 15 more
 

1183
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,310
15 feet attack somebody move 15 more
feet in Pathfinder it takes one action

1184
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,320
feet in Pathfinder it takes one action
 

1185
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,870
feet in Pathfinder it takes one action
for you to stride up to your speed and

1186
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
for you to stride up to your speed and
 

1187
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,430
for you to stride up to your speed and
then would be a second action to attack

1188
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
then would be a second action to attack
 

1189
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,750
then would be a second action to attack
and then if you wanted to uh move again

1190
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:32,760
and then if you wanted to uh move again
 

1191
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,710
and then if you wanted to uh move again
you would have to spend your third

1192
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:33,720
you would have to spend your third
 

1193
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,470
you would have to spend your third
attack even if you didn't use all of

1194
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:35,480
attack even if you didn't use all of
 

1195
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,830
attack even if you didn't use all of
your speed on your first

1196
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
your speed on your first
 

1197
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,590
your speed on your first
attack and um a lot of 5V players don't

1198
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
attack and um a lot of 5V players don't
 

1199
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,269
attack and um a lot of 5V players don't
don't like this uh generally speaking um

1200
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:46,279
don't like this uh generally speaking um
 

1201
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,310

I think it's a bit of a wash because in

1202
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,320
I think it's a bit of a wash because in
 

1203
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,110
I think it's a bit of a wash because in
Pathfinder we have three actions that we

in D and D5 you're used to being able to

00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
in D and D5 you're used to being able to

1800
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
actions to ready so on your turn you'll
 

1801
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,950
actions to ready so on your turn you'll
say I'm going to spend these two actions

say I'm going to spend these two actions
 

1803

and I'm going to ready this action to
 

1805

act but they rolled lower in the

1822
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
act but they rolled lower in the
 

1823
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,390

initiative and Pathfinder you can

1824
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,400
initiative and Pathfinder you can
 

1825
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,910
initiative and Pathfinder you can
basically voluntarily lower your

1826
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:38,920
basically voluntarily lower your
 

1827
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,589
basically voluntarily lower your
initiative score as low as you like so

1828
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
initiative score as low as you like so
 

1829
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,630
initiative score as low as you like so
you can drop down to an initiative score

1830
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:45,640
you can drop down to an initiative score
 

1831
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,710
you can drop down to an initiative score
below your your allies let them go first

1832
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:49,720
below your your allies let them go first
 

1833
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,109
below your your allies let them go first
and then take your turn so this is

1834
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
and then take your turn so this is
 

1835
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,150
and then take your turn so this is
somewhat similar to what you're used to

1836
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,160
somewhat similar to what you're used to
 

1837
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,589
somewhat similar to what you're used to
in 5 where you might be first in the

00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,710
in 5 where you might be first in the
initiative order and use your your ready

1840
00:40:59,710 --> 00:40:59,720
initiative order and use your your ready
 

1841
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,470
initiative order and use your your ready
action to say I'm going to wait until my

00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:03,480
action to say I'm going to wait until my
 

1843
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,190
action to say I'm going to wait until my
more tanky allies move first and then as

1844
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,200
more tanky allies move first and then as
 

1845
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,550
more tanky allies move first and then as
my readed action I'm going to follow

1846
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:07,560
my readed action I'm going to follow
 

1847
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,270
my readed action I'm going to follow
after them or do something like that the

1848
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
after them or do something like that the
 

1849
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,990
after them or do something like that the
key difference here is in 5e a readed

1850
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
key difference here is in 5e a readed
 

1851
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,990
key difference here is in 5e a readed
action is One Singular action you you

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,000
action is One Singular action you you
 

1853
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,790
action is One Singular action you you
prepare to do that one action uh later

1854
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
prepare to do that one action uh later
 

1855
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,670
prepare to do that one action uh later
in initiative as a result of something

1856
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:20,680
in initiative as a result of something
 

1857
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,349
in initiative as a result of something
else whereas in Pathfinder when you

1858
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:24,359
else whereas in Pathfinder when you
 

1859
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,510

delay you you do change your place in
 

1861
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,950
delay you you do change your place in
the initial order and when that comes

1862
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
the initial order and when that comes
 

1863
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,870
the initial order and when that comes
around you get all three of your actions

1864
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:31,880
around you get all three of your actions
 

1865
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,510
around you get all three of your actions
you get to take your full term then and

1866
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:34,520
you get to take your full term then and
 

1867
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,190
you get to take your full term then and
your place in the initiative order

1868
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,200
your place in the initiative order
 

1869
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,510
your place in the initiative order
remains in that place going forward so

1870
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
remains in that place going forward so
 

1871
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,910
remains in that place going forward so
the next thing I want to talk about is

00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
the next thing I want to talk about is
 

1873
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,230
the next thing I want to talk about is
uh a thing called secret checks that

1874
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
uh a thing called secret checks that
 

1875
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,990
uh a thing called secret checks that
exist in Pathfinder second edition so as

1876
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,000
exist in Pathfinder second edition so as
 

1877
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,230
exist in Pathfinder second edition so as
the name applies a secret check is a

1878
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
the name applies a secret check is a
 

1879
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,950
the name applies a secret check is a
skill or something else that is rolled

1880
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
skill or something else that is rolled
 

1881
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,589
skill or something else that is rolled
on the players behalf by the GM in

1882
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:56,599
on the players behalf by the GM in
 

1883
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,910
on the players behalf by the GM in
secret behind behind their screen and uh

1884
00:41:59,910 --> 00:41:59,920
secret behind behind their screen and uh
 

1885
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,710
secret behind behind their screen and uh
so the GM rolls it for the players and

1886
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:03,720
so the GM rolls it for the players and
 

1887
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,109
so the GM rolls it for the players and
does not necessarily tell them uh it

1888
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:06,119
does not necessarily tell them uh it
 

1889
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,309
does not necessarily tell them uh it
certainly does not tell them the

1890
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:07,319
certainly does not tell them the
 

1891
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,309
certainly does not tell them the
numerical result it may not even tell

1892
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:09,319
numerical result it may not even tell
 

1893
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,309
numerical result it may not even tell
them if they succeeded or failed so this

1894
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:12,319
them if they succeeded or failed so this
 

1895
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,670
them if they succeeded or failed so this
is for those situations where a
