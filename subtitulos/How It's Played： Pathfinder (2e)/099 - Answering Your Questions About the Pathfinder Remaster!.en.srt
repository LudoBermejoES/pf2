00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
question that was asked and it's all
 

129
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,949
question that was asked and it's all
about recall knowledge we we have heard

165
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,949
specific question they're not going to
say I want to do recall knowledge on

166
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:35,959
say I want to do recall knowledge on
 

167
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,949
say I want to do recall knowledge on
this windigo they might say I'm going to

168
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
this windigo they might say I'm going to
 

169
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,710
this windigo they might say I'm going to
do recall knowledge and I would like to

170
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:41,720
do recall knowledge and I would like to
 

171
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,990
do recall knowledge and I would like to
know if the the Windy go is weak to fire

172
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
know if the the Windy go is weak to fire
 

173
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,630
know if the the Windy go is weak to fire
so it's going to be one question they

174
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
so it's going to be one question they
 

175
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,190
so it's going to be one question they
ask and then the gy is going to make a a

176
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,200
ask and then the gy is going to make a a
 

177
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,309
ask and then the gy is going to make a a
secret um skill check for that person's

178
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
secret um skill check for that person's
 

179
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,789
secret um skill check for that person's
um recall knowledge check and if it is a

180
00:03:59,789 --> 00:03:59,799
um recall knowledge check and if it is a
 

181
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,670
um recall knowledge check and if it is a
success then they're going to answer

182
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
success then they're going to answer
 

183
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,270
success then they're going to answer
that question if it is a failure nothing

184
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,280
that question if it is a failure nothing
 

185
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,630
that question if it is a failure nothing
happens if it's a critical failure the

186
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
happens if it's a critical failure the
 

187
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,149
happens if it's a critical failure the
GM is going to give them a false bit of

188
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:09,159
GM is going to give them a false bit of
 

189
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,309
GM is going to give them a false bit of
information and if it's a critical

190
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:11,319
information and if it's a critical
 

191
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,789
information and if it's a critical
success then the GM's going to answer

192
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:13,799
success then the GM's going to answer
 

193
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,069
success then the GM's going to answer
that question and either expound on it

194
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
that question and either expound on it
 

195
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,830
that question and either expound on it
with more related adjacent information

196
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
with more related adjacent information
 

197
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,909
with more related adjacent information
or might um might uh just allow them to

198
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
or might um might uh just allow them to
 

199
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,629
or might um might uh just allow them to
ask a second question as well so in a

200
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:27,639
ask a second question as well so in a
 

201
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,230
ask a second question as well so in a
nutshell that's how recall knowledge is

202
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,240
nutshell that's how recall knowledge is
 

203
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,629
nutshell that's how recall knowledge is
working now uh no more do we have to

204
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:31,639
working now uh no more do we have to
 

205
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,070
working now uh no more do we have to
worry about the mystery of figuring out

206
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
worry about the mystery of figuring out
 

207
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,270
worry about the mystery of figuring out
what would be the most commonly known uh

208
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
what would be the most commonly known uh
 

209
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,749
what would be the most commonly known uh
trait or aspect of whatever recall

210
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
trait or aspect of whatever recall
 

211
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,710
trait or aspect of whatever recall
knowledge is being applied to and

212
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:41,720
knowledge is being applied to and
 

213
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,670
knowledge is being applied to and
instead uh the onus is on the player to

214
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:44,680
instead uh the onus is on the player to
 

215
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,469
instead uh the onus is on the player to
ask us a specific question that they

216
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:47,479
ask us a specific question that they
 

217
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,150
ask us a specific question that they
want answered so the second question was

218
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,160
want answered so the second question was
 

219
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,469
want answered so the second question was
all about uh states of awareness in

220
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
all about uh states of awareness in
 

221
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,430
all about uh states of awareness in
Stealth have there been any uh

222
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,440
Stealth have there been any uh
 

223
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,990
Stealth have there been any uh
meaningful material changes to those and

224
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
meaningful material changes to those and
 

225
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,029
meaningful material changes to those and
from an overview and reading of those

226
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
from an overview and reading of those
 

227
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,790
from an overview and reading of those
pieces in the player core I do not see

228
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:05,800
pieces in the player core I do not see
 

229
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,430
pieces in the player core I do not see
any meaningful material changes um that

230
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
any meaningful material changes um that
 

231
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,310
any meaningful material changes um that
are applied to any of the uh states of

232
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
are applied to any of the uh states of
 

233
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,790
are applied to any of the uh states of
awareness or to stealth moving on is

234
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:15,800
awareness or to stealth moving on is
 

235
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,430
awareness or to stealth moving on is
kind of a big one and I'm going to have

236
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
kind of a big one and I'm going to have
 

237
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,029
kind of a big one and I'm going to have
to kind of divide it into a number of

238
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
to kind of divide it into a number of
 

239
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,430
to kind of divide it into a number of
different parts and these are all about

240
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
different parts and these are all about
 

241
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,070
different parts and these are all about
the new damage types so how to how do

242
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
the new damage types so how to how do
 

243
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,830
the new damage types so how to how do
vitality and void work how do holy and

244
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:28,840
vitality and void work how do holy and
 

245
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,870
vitality and void work how do holy and
Unholy damage work and how does Spirit

246
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:31,880
Unholy damage work and how does Spirit
 

247
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,230
Unholy damage work and how does Spirit
damage work so first up vitality and

248
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,240
damage work so first up vitality and
 

249
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,550
damage work so first up vitality and
void damage as far as I can tell they

250
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,560
void damage as far as I can tell they
 

251
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,309
void damage as far as I can tell they
are pretty much just onetoone

252
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:40,319
are pretty much just onetoone
 

253
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,950
are pretty much just onetoone
correspondence to the positive and

254
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
correspondence to the positive and
 

255
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,070
correspondence to the positive and
negative damage types that we already

256
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080
negative damage types that we already
 

257
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,150
negative damage types that we already
had uh Vitality damage will only harm

258
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
had uh Vitality damage will only harm
 

259
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,230
had uh Vitality damage will only harm
Undead and uh the opposite is true void

260
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
Undead and uh the opposite is true void
 

261
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,629
Undead and uh the opposite is true void
damage will only harm the

00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
damage will only harm the
 

263
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,550
damage will only harm the
living um then holy and Unholy so holy

264
00:05:59,550 --> 00:05:59,560
living um then holy and Unholy so holy
 

265
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,870
living um then holy and Unholy so holy
and Unholy damage types and the holy and

266
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
and Unholy damage types and the holy and
 

267
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,070
and Unholy damage types and the holy and
Unholy traits are largely replacing the

268
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,080
Unholy traits are largely replacing the
 

269
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,670
Unholy traits are largely replacing the
mechanical side of alignments so if you

270
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
mechanical side of alignments so if you
 

271
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,589
mechanical side of alignments so if you
haven't heard the big news in the

272
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:13,599
haven't heard the big news in the
 

273
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,909
haven't heard the big news in the
Pathfinder second edition remaster

274
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
Pathfinder second edition remaster
 

275
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,350
Pathfinder second edition remaster
alignments are a thing of the past and

276
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
alignments are a thing of the past and
 

277
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,230
alignments are a thing of the past and
so there's still a mechanical need

278
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
so there's still a mechanical need
 

279
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,150
so there's still a mechanical need
especially for divine characters to be

280
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,160
especially for divine characters to be
 

281
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,749
especially for divine characters to be
able to apply some sort of additional

282
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:28,759
able to apply some sort of additional
 

283
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,749
able to apply some sort of additional
effect when they're fighting um fiends

284
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
effect when they're fighting um fiends
 

285
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,309
effect when they're fighting um fiends
and evil doers and so forth but we can't

286
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
and evil doers and so forth but we can't
 

287
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,430
and evil doers and so forth but we can't
say evil doer anymore cuz evil is not a

288
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440
say evil doer anymore cuz evil is not a
 

289
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,950
say evil doer anymore cuz evil is not a
mechanical concept

290
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:37,960
mechanical concept
 

291
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,510
mechanical concept
anymore so first thing you need to know

292
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:40,520
anymore so first thing you need to know
 

293
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,430
anymore so first thing you need to know
is there is this thing called being

294
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,440
is there is this thing called being
 

295
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,469
is there is this thing called being
Sanctified and

296
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
Sanctified and
 

297
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,469
Sanctified and
sanctification when you are a uh when

298
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:47,479
sanctification when you are a uh when
 

299
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,510
sanctification when you are a uh when
you choose to play a cleric and this is

300
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
you choose to play a cleric and this is
 

301
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,270
you choose to play a cleric and this is
really in player core one the only area

302
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
really in player core one the only area
 

303
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,710
really in player core one the only area
with this comes into effect we'll have

304
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:55,720
with this comes into effect we'll have
 

305
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,390
with this comes into effect we'll have
to wait for player Core 2 to see how uh

306
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,400
to wait for player Core 2 to see how uh
 

307

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,309
and potentially other other uh classes
but um if you are a cleric you must

312
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:11,319
but um if you are a cleric you must
 

313
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,869
but um if you are a cleric you must
choose a god you worship and that God is

314
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:14,879
choose a god you worship and that God is
 

315

choose a god you worship and that God is
going to have some manner of

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
going to have some manner of
 

317
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,029
going to have some manner of
sanctification listing in their little

318
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,039
sanctification listing in their little
 

319
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,670

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,869
write up in the uh in the rule book and
so that is either going to say if that

00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:27,879
so that is either going to say if that
 

323
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,830
so that is either going to say if that
the clerics that follow that God must be

and uh constructs are going to be immune
 

457
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,389
and uh constructs are going to be immune
to this kind of damage because they

458
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
to this kind of damage because they
 

459
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,949
to this kind of damage because they
don't have Spirits typically so the next

460

647
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,790
Second Edition rules you could refocus
for 10 minutes but you could only do

648
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:01,800
for 10 minutes but you could only do
 

649
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,110
for 10 minutes but you could only do
that if you had spent at least one Focus

650
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
that if you had spent at least one Focus
 

651
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,389
that if you had spent at least one Focus
Point since the last time you uh

652
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
Point since the last time you uh
 

653
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,030
Point since the last time you uh
refocused and so that would prevent

654
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
refocused and so that would prevent
 

655
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,350
refocused and so that would prevent
someone from taking 30 minute taking a

someone from taking 30 minute taking a
 

657
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,790
someone from taking 30 minute taking a

658
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
30- minute break after a fight and
 

659
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,069
30- minute break after a fight and

660
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:17,079
getting all three of their points back
 

661
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:18,430
getting all three of their points back
and having them all available for the

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:18,440
and having them all available for the
 

663
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,150
and having them all available for the
next fight that rule was uh more than a

664
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
next fight that rule was uh more than a

little confusing to to a number of

666
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
little confusing to to a number of
 

667
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,710
little confusing to to a number of
people so they've simplified it in the

668
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
people so they've simplified it in the

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,309
language is removed from refocus it no
longer has that limitation so now if you

674
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:34,319
longer has that limitation so now if you
 

675
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,590
longer has that limitation so now if you
do have 30 minutes you can spend uh all

676
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:38,600
do have 30 minutes you can spend uh all
 

677
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,829
do have 30 minutes you can spend uh all
30 minutes and refocus three times in a

30 minutes and refocus three times in a
 

679
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,350
30 minutes and refocus three times in a

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:42,360
row and get all three of your focus
 

681
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,590

683
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,910

the next couple questions are all

686
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:50,360
the next couple questions are all
 

687
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,870
the next couple questions are all
dealing with the layout of the book um

688
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
dealing with the layout of the book um
 

689
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,990
dealing with the layout of the book um
is it more user friendly is it easier to

690
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
is it more user friendly is it easier to
 

691
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,269
is it more user friendly is it easier to
navigate gate around does it look nice

692
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
navigate gate around does it look nice
 

693
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,189
navigate gate around does it look nice
uh so first of all yeah I think it looks

694
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:04,199
uh so first of all yeah I think it looks
 

695
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,110
uh so first of all yeah I think it looks
very nice second of all um it is a

696
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
very nice second of all um it is a
 

697
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,350
very nice second of all um it is a
little easier to navigate around but I

698
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,360
little easier to navigate around but I
 

699
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,590
little easier to navigate around but I
don't think the changes are are so uh

700
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
don't think the changes are are so uh
 

701
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,549
don't think the changes are are so uh
material and wide sweeping that I would

702
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:15,559
material and wide sweeping that I would
 

703
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,669
material and wide sweeping that I would
go so far as to say that it's

704
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
go so far as to say that it's
 

705
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,870
go so far as to say that it's
fundamentally an easier layout and book

706

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,029
and you don't have to have a formula for
uncommon and more rare as long as you

972
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:40,039
uncommon and more rare as long as you
 

973
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,470
uncommon and more rare as long as you
have a sample to work off of but if you

974
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
have a sample to work off of but if you
 

975
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,830
have a sample to work off of but if you
do have the formula for what you're

976
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:46,840
do have the formula for what you're
 

977
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,710
do have the formula for what you're
trying to craft then the amount of time

978
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
trying to craft then the amount of time
 

979
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,390
trying to craft then the amount of time
needed to to craft it is further reduced

980
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
needed to to craft it is further reduced
 

981
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,830
needed to to craft it is further reduced
from two days to only one day so if you

982
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:58,840
from two days to only one day so if you
 

983
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,269
from two days to only one day so if you
were to apply this logic to the original

984
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
were to apply this logic to the original
 

985
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,549
were to apply this logic to the original
crafting rules and you have the formula

986
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
crafting rules and you have the formula
 

987
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,789
crafting rules and you have the formula
for whatever you're trying to craft then

988
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
for whatever you're trying to craft then
 

989
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,710
for whatever you're trying to craft then
it goes from being a minimum four days

990
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
it goes from being a minimum four days
 

991
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,029
it goes from being a minimum four days
to a minimum one day of work uh so I

992
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:14,039
to a minimum one day of work uh so I
 

993
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,750
to a minimum one day of work uh so I
think that's going to make a lot of

994
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
think that's going to make a lot of
 

995
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,110
think that's going to make a lot of
people happy out there even if it

996
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,120
people happy out there even if it
 

997
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,750
people happy out there even if it
doesn't fix all of the concerns that

998
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:20,760
doesn't fix all of the concerns that
 

999
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,310
doesn't fix all of the concerns that
exist uh with crafting moving on the

1000
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
exist uh with crafting moving on the
 

1001
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,269
exist uh with crafting moving on the
next question is about disarm did they

1002
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
next question is about disarm did they
 

1003
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,310
next question is about disarm did they
fix disarm rules um and I can't

1004
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
fix disarm rules um and I can't
 

1005
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,870
fix disarm rules um and I can't
objectively say if it is fixed or not

1006
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
objectively say if it is fixed or not
 

1007
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,190
objectively say if it is fixed or not
but they did improveed this did get a

1008
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
but they did improveed this did get a
 

1009
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,310
but they did improveed this did get a
buff and what they've done is they've

1010
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
buff and what they've done is they've
 

1011
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,630
buff and what they've done is they've
removed the limitation that's listed in

the write up for disarm that says until
the start of that creature's turn so in

00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:51,159
the start of that creature's turn so in
 

1017
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,590
the start of that creature's turn so in
the original disarm rules if you

on a uh disarm attempt then you JW the

on a uh disarm attempt then you JW the
 

1023
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,830
on a uh disarm attempt then you JW the

item loose in your opponent's hand and
 

1025

that gives you a plus two to Future

that gives you a plus two to Future

that gives you a plus two to Future

attempts to knock it out which would
require a critical success and it

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:12,840
require a critical success and it

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,710
you're trying to remove from their grasp
and fix their grip so uh that so when it

1074
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:17,720
and fix their grip so uh that so when it

1079
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,750
enemy's turn they're going to have to
make the decision do I want to attack

1080
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:22,760
make the decision do I want to attack
 

1081
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,350
make the decision do I want to attack
with this and suffer a negative -2 to

1082
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,360
with this and suffer a negative -2 to
 

1083
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,950
with this and suffer a negative -2 to
the attack or do I want to sacrifice one

1084
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
the attack or do I want to sacrifice one

1086
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:31,880
of my three actions to regrip the weapon
 

1087
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,110
of my three actions to regrip the weapon
properly um and remove those penalties

1088
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,120
properly um and remove those penalties
 

1089
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,029
properly um and remove those penalties
so probably is not the uh the fix

1090
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
so probably is not the uh the fix
 

1091
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,389
so probably is not the uh the fix
