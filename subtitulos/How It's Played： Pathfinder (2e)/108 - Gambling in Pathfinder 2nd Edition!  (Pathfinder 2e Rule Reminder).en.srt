start over again you're going to to
 

393
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,110
start over again you're going to to
double the size of the current ante and

394
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,120
double the size of the current ante and

until every round if nobody beats the
 

399
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,949
until every round if nobody beats the
goem we start again and double it and

400
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
goem we start again and double it and
 

401
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,470
goem we start again and double it and
double it double it and um at the or

402
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:13,480
double it double it and um at the or

a dealer so Shooters are going to roll

438
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
a dealer so Shooters are going to roll
 

439
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,110
a dealer so Shooters are going to roll
2D2 and the dealer is going to roll 3d6

440
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,120

441
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,350
2D2 and the dealer is going to roll 3d6
and the the goal is if you're the

442
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
and the the goal is if you're the
 

443
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,190
and the the goal is if you're the
shooter you want to bound the total of

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
shooter you want to bound the total of
 

445
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,269
shooter you want to bound the total of
the dealers

446
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:12,279
the dealers
 

447
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,630
the dealers
3d6 and bounding means one of your D20

448
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:15,640
3d6 and bounding means one of your D20
 

449
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,190
3d6 and bounding means one of your D20
numbers is lower than the Dealer's 3d6

450
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
numbers is lower than the Dealer's 3d6
 

451
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,389

total and your other D20 is higher than
 

453
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,870
total and your other D20 is higher than
the 3d6 total from the dealer so you're

454
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
the 3d6 total from the dealer so you're
 

455
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,790
the 3d6 total from the dealer so you're
on either side on either bounds you're

456
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:29,800
on either side on either bounds you're
 

457
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,750
on either side on either bounds you're
bounding the um the dealers 3d6 total so

458
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
bounding the um the dealers 3d6 total so
 

459
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,389
bounding the um the dealers 3d6 total so
the way this is going to work in turn is

477
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,470
first die and it's a a one a two a 19 or
a 20 then they know they're going to

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
a 20 then they know they're going to
 

479
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,110
a 20 then they know they're going to
have at least one di on one side of the

481
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,949
have at least one di on one side of the
3d6 because one 12 19 and 20 are not

482
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
3d6 because one 12 19 and 20 are not
 

483
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,990
3d6 because one 12 19 and 20 are not
possible totals for 3d6 so there they're

484
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
possible totals for 3d6 so there they're
 

485
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,750
possible totals for 3d6 so there they're
going to say yeah automatically I'm

486
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
going to say yeah automatically I'm
 

487
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,269
going to say yeah automatically I'm
going to double my my my stake um and

488
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:24,279
going to double my my my stake um and
 

489
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,750
going to double my my my stake um and
they can also D choose a double it I

490
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:26,760
they can also D choose a double it I
 

491
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,670
they can also D choose a double it I
mean if if they roll a five they might

492
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
mean if if they roll a five they might
 

493
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,910
mean if if they roll a five they might
choose to double it because still odds

494
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
choose to double it because still odds
 

495
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,750
choose to double it because still odds
are good but so on and so forth they get

496
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
are good but so on and so forth they get
 

497
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,550
are good but so on and so forth they get
the opportunity to double it if if they

498
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
the opportunity to double it if if they
 

499
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,750
the opportunity to double it if if they
if they roll a nine on that one20 they

500
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,760
if they roll a nine on that one20 they
 

501
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,030
if they roll a nine on that one20 they
probably don't want to risk doubling

502
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,040
probably don't want to risk doubling
 

503
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,030
probably don't want to risk doubling
their uh their stake um at that point

504
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
their uh their stake um at that point
 

505
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,350
their uh their stake um at that point
all the other gamblers who are not the

506
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
all the other gamblers who are not the
 

507
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,269
all the other gamblers who are not the
shooter on the table can choose whether

508
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:50,279
shooter on the table can choose whether
 

509
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,949
shooter on the table can choose whether
or not they want to bet on the final

510
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
or not they want to bet on the final
 

511
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,389
or not they want to bet on the final
result so they can throw in a stake and

512
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:55,399
result so they can throw in a stake and
 

513
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,910
result so they can throw in a stake and
say I think uh the shooter is going to

514
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
say I think uh the shooter is going to
 

515
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,269
say I think uh the shooter is going to
win based on this first role on this

516
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:00,279
win based on this first role on this
 

517
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,030
win based on this first role on this
point I think they're going to win

518
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
point I think they're going to win
 

519
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,150
point I think they're going to win
they're going to bound the dealers roles

520
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,160
they're going to bound the dealers roles
 

521
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,310
they're going to bound the dealers roles
so I'm going to throw 10 gold into the

522
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,320
so I'm going to throw 10 gold into the
 

523
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,590
so I'm going to throw 10 gold into the
pot or

524
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:08,600
pot or
 

525
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,310
pot or
whatever at that point the dealer is

526
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
whatever at that point the dealer is
 

527
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,470
whatever at that point the dealer is
going to roll their

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
going to roll their
 

529
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,829
going to roll their

539
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,750

going to be or actually not the total

going to be or actually not the total
 

541
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,350
going to be or actually not the total

roll all even numbers or I think they're
 

549
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,990
roll all even numbers or I think they're
going to roll three of a kind and um if

550
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
going to roll three of a kind and um if
 

551
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,710
going to roll three of a kind and um if
you bet that they're going to roll all

552
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
you bet that they're going to roll all
 

553
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,829
you bet that they're going to roll all
odd or all even you get uh you get

odd or all even you get uh you get
 

555
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,110
odd or all even you get uh you get
basically double back you get the same

556
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,120
basically double back you get the same
 

557
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,069
basically double back you get the same
amount as what you staked and in profit

558
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:57,079
amount as what you staked and in profit
 

559
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,590
amount as what you staked and in profit
and if you bet that there are going to

560
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
and if you bet that there are going to
 

561
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,550
and if you bet that there are going to
roll three of a kind you uh get tripled

562
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:03,560
roll three of a kind you uh get tripled
 

563
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,150
roll three of a kind you uh get tripled
now uh let me I'm going to give me one

564
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
now uh let me I'm going to give me one
 

565
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,189
now uh let me I'm going to give me one
second check here because I have on my

566
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:08,199
second check here because I have on my
 

567
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,310
second check here because I have on my
form here the odds yeah the odds of the

568
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,320
form here the odds yeah the odds of the
 

569
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,949
form here the odds yeah the odds of the
dealer rolling all evens or odds on 3d6

570
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:15,959
dealer rolling all evens or odds on 3d6
 

571
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,870
dealer rolling all evens or odds on 3d6
is less than a 133% chance and the odds

572
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:19,880
is less than a 133% chance and the odds
 

573
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,069
is less than a 133% chance and the odds
of rolling three of a kind is less than

574
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:23,079
of rolling three of a kind is less than
 

575
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,189
of rolling three of a kind is less than
3% so these sound like pretty bad bets

576
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:26,199
3% so these sound like pretty bad bets
 

577
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,670
3% so these sound like pretty bad bets
to me but um but that is something that

578
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
to me but um but that is something that
 

579
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,870
to me but um but that is something that
is an option when playing

580
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
is an option when playing
 

581
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,030
is an option when playing
Bounder so then um the dealer rolls

582
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,040
Bounder so then um the dealer rolls
 

583
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,030
Bounder so then um the dealer rolls
there 3d6 you see the total and uh from

584
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,040
there 3d6 you see the total and uh from
 

585
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,590
there 3d6 you see the total and uh from
there if if the total is equal to the

586
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
there if if the total is equal to the
 

587
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,110
there if if the total is equal to the
first 1 D20 that the that the shooter

588
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,120
first 1 D20 that the that the shooter
 

589
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,269
first 1 D20 that the that the shooter
rolled then the shooter automatically

590
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:48,279
rolled then the shooter automatically
 

591
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,269
rolled then the shooter automatically
loses and everybody loses their stake on

592
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:50,279
loses and everybody loses their stake on
 

593
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,790
loses and everybody loses their stake on
that um in order to win boundary you

594
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
that um in order to win boundary you
 

595
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,310
that um in order to win boundary you
have to have one lower than and one

596
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
have to have one lower than and one
 

597
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,949
have to have one lower than and one
higher than any die that equals the

598
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
higher than any die that equals the
 

599
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,430
higher than any die that equals the
total of the dealer automatically lose

600
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
total of the dealer automatically lose
 

601
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,030
total of the dealer automatically lose
loses and then the shooter is going to

602
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,040
loses and then the shooter is going to
 

603
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,230
loses and then the shooter is going to
roll their other D20 and see if they win

604
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,240
roll their other D20 and see if they win
 

605
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,910
roll their other D20 and see if they win
if they end up with having one of their

if they end up with having one of their
 

607
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,749
if they end up with having one of their
D20 results being lower than the dealers

D20 results being lower than the dealers
 

609
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,430
D20 results being lower than the dealers
3d6 total and one Higher they're going

610
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
3d6 total and one Higher they're going
 

611
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,030
3d6 total and one Higher they're going
to uh get a they're going to win an

to uh get a they're going to win an
 

613
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,590
to uh get a they're going to win an
amount equal to their stake and if uh if

614
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
amount equal to their stake and if uh if
 

615
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,790
amount equal to their stake and if uh if
if any other scenario happens either

if any other scenario happens either
 

617
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,430
if any other scenario happens either
they tie or both numbers are lower but

618
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
they tie or both numbers are lower but
 

619
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,990
they tie or both numbers are lower but
the numbers are higher then they lose

620
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
the numbers are higher then they lose
 

621
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,389
the numbers are higher then they lose
their their

their their
stake uh this the odds of this it says

624
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,160
stake uh this the odds of this it says
 

625
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,030

about 40% of the time and after one
 

629
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,030
about 40% of the time and after one
person plays as the shooter then you

630
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
person plays as the shooter then you
 

631
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,670
person plays as the shooter then you
just go like clockwise around the table

632
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:42,680
just go like clockwise around the table
 

633
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,069
just go like clockwise around the table
and the next Gambler gets their chance

634
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
and the next Gambler gets their chance
 

635
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,509
and the next Gambler gets their chance
to be the shooter and it just repeats

636
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
to be the shooter and it just repeats
 

637
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,710
to be the shooter and it just repeats
and repeats for as long as people want

lottery so basically what happens is the
 

655
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,269
lottery so basically what happens is the
house is going to be randomly generating

656
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
house is going to be randomly generating
 

657
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,030
house is going to be randomly generating
20 numbers and those numbers are going

658
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
20 numbers and those numbers are going
 

659
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,350
20 numbers and those numbers are going
to be between one and 100 and you can

660
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:22,360
to be between one and 100 and you can
 

661
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,310
to be between one and 100 and you can
choose to uh bet between two and 10

662
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
choose to uh bet between two and 10
 

663
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,550
choose to uh bet between two and 10
times so you can you can choose choose

664
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,560
times so you can you can choose choose
 

665
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,110
times so you can you can choose choose
two numbers between one and 100 or you

666
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
two numbers between one and 100 or you
 

667
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,910
two numbers between one and 100 or you
can choose 10 numbers between one and

668
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
can choose 10 numbers between one and
 

669
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,949
can choose 10 numbers between one and
100 or anywhere between there and for

670
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
100 or anywhere between there and for
 

671
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,710
100 or anywhere between there and for
every number that you pick that is that

672
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
every number that you pick that is that
 

673
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,430
every number that you pick that is that
is drawn or rolled by the house then

674
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
is drawn or rolled by the house then
 

675
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,870
is drawn or rolled by the house then
you're going to win uh an amount of

676
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:47,880
you're going to win uh an amount of
 

677
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,389
you're going to win uh an amount of
money and uh if you don't then you lose

678
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
money and uh if you don't then you lose
 

679
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,790
money and uh if you don't then you lose
your money so it it is basically just a

680
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
your money so it it is basically just a
 

681
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,710
your money so it it is basically just a
lottery system as far as I can tell uh

682
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:55,720
lottery system as far as I can tell uh
 

683
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,990
lottery system as far as I can tell uh
there is a handy chart that's in the

684
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
there is a handy chart that's in the
 

685
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,590
there is a handy chart that's in the
book that shows you

686
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
book that shows you
 

687
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,990
book that shows you
the amount of money that is W uh if you

688
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,000
the amount of money that is W uh if you
 

689
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,629
the amount of money that is W uh if you
correctly guess the numbers so for

690
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:05,639
correctly guess the numbers so for
 

691
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,749
correctly guess the numbers so for
example we can see on this chart if you

692
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:08,759
example we can see on this chart if you
 

693
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,430
example we can see on this chart if you
uh predicted two numbers and you got one

694
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
uh predicted two numbers and you got one
 

695
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,189
uh predicted two numbers and you got one
of those right you're going to win times

696
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:14,199
of those right you're going to win times
 

697
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,710
of those right you're going to win times
one which basically just means you're

698
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:15,720
one which basically just means you're
 

699
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,189
one which basically just means you're
breaking even they're going to give you

700
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
breaking even they're going to give you
 

701
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,949
breaking even they're going to give you
back the money that you bet uh if you if

702
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
back the money that you bet uh if you if
 

703
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,069
back the money that you bet uh if you if
you made seven predictions or you know

704
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
you made seven predictions or you know
 

705
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,189
you made seven predictions or you know
you chose like seven lottery numbers if

706
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:26,199
you chose like seven lottery numbers if
 

707
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,509
you chose like seven lottery numbers if
that's an easier way to think of it and

708
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:28,519
that's an easier way to think of it and
 

709
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,670
that's an easier way to think of it and
a four of those came correct you're

710
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:30,680
a four of those came correct you're
 

711
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,790
a four of those came correct you're
going to get to double your your money

712
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
going to get to double your your money
 

713
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,829
going to get to double your your money
back if you made 10 predictions and you

714
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
back if you made 10 predictions and you
 

715
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,550
back if you made 10 predictions and you
got six of those 10 rights you're going

716
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:37,560
got six of those 10 rights you're going
 

717
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,670
got six of those 10 rights you're going
to get 20 uh times your your stake back

718
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
to get 20 uh times your your stake back
 

719
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,309
to get 20 uh times your your stake back
so it's it's purely a lottery you're

720
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:46,319
so it's it's purely a lottery you're
 

721
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,910
so it's it's purely a lottery you're
basically guessing numbers and and then

722
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
basically guessing numbers and and then
 

723
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,309
basically guessing numbers and and then
the GM who's playing the the house will

724
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:54,319
the GM who's playing the the house will
 

725
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,110
the GM who's playing the the house will
roll 1D 10020 times and that's how we

726
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
roll 1D 10020 times and that's how we
 

727
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,670
roll 1D 10020 times and that's how we
generate our numbers and if you

728
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
generate our numbers and if you
 

729
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,030
generate our numbers and if you
correctly predict a certain number of

730
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
correctly predict a certain number of
 

731
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,510
correctly predict a certain number of
those um of those 1D 100 rolls then you

732
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
those um of those 1D 100 rolls then you
 

733
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,029
those um of those 1D 100 rolls then you
are potentially going to get a payout um

734
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
are potentially going to get a payout um
 

735
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,789
are potentially going to get a payout um
if you made 10 predictions and got four

736
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:13,799
if you made 10 predictions and got four
 

737
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,549
if you made 10 predictions and got four
of them right you're going to get

738
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:15,559
of them right you're going to get
 

739
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,829
of them right you're going to get
nothing if you do 10 predictions you got

740
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
nothing if you do 10 predictions you got
 

741
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,470
nothing if you do 10 predictions you got
to get at least half of those right out

742
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
to get at least half of those right out
 

743
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,870
to get at least half of those right out
of the out of one to 100 um so

744
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:25,880
of the out of one to 100 um so
 

745
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,549
of the out of one to 100 um so
unsurprisingly the odds are always going

746
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
unsurprisingly the odds are always going
 

747
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,669
unsurprisingly the odds are always going
to be in The house's

748
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:30,679
to be in The house's
 

749
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,390
to be in The house's
favor so that is basically how Kino

750
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
favor so that is basically how Kino
 

751
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,350
favor so that is basically how Kino
works so we have our first option is

752
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,360
works so we have our first option is
 

753
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,549
works so we have our first option is
earn income super simple super easy um

754
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:43,559
earn income super simple super easy um
 

755
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,510
earn income super simple super easy um
it interacts with your character's

756
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
it interacts with your character's
 

757
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,390
it interacts with your character's
skills but it's not super immersive

758
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
skills but it's not super immersive
 

759
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,070
skills but it's not super immersive
second option take one of those three

760
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
second option take one of those three
 

761
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,230
second option take one of those three
games out of all or nothing they are

762
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
games out of all or nothing they are
 

763
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,590
games out of all or nothing they are
very immersive but they're also timec

764
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:56,600
very immersive but they're also timec
 

765
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,149
very immersive but they're also timec
consuming and they don't interact at all

766
00:17:59,149 --> 00:17:59,159
consuming and they don't interact at all
 

767
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:01,909

with your character sheet it's entirely

with your character sheet it's entirely
 

769
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,230
with your character sheet it's entirely

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
player choose to do the last option is
 

773
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,190

kind of a happy middle ground between

774
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
kind of a happy middle ground between
 

775
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,190
kind of a happy middle ground between
the two but it's definitely going to

776
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:12,200
the two but it's definitely going to
 

777
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,590
the two but it's definitely going to
take some work on your end as a GM and

778
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:14,600
take some work on your end as a GM and
 

779
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,149
take some work on your end as a GM and
that is just to use the victory point
