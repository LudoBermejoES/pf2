spells. You can also tell they are
 

167
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,990

them to his spell repertoire. Instead,

spell list, which would then make the
 

181
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,190

spells available for his repertoire. And

182
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
spells available for his repertoire. And
 

183
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,990

a quick note, some viewers out there may
 

185
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,070
a quick note, some viewers out there may
be questioning whether all characters in

be questioning whether all characters in
 

187
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,910
be questioning whether all characters in
all circumstances need to adhere to

all circumstances need to adhere to
 

189
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,070
all circumstances need to adhere to
maintaining a personal spell list, as I

general terms to avoid having to cover

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
general terms to avoid having to cover
 

197
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,550
general terms to avoid having to cover
every exception and every special case

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
every exception and every special case
 

199
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,110
every exception and every special case
from every different class. But in

from every different class. But in
 

201
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,949
from every different class. But in
general, the classes that do not use

00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
general, the classes that do not use
 

203
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,030
general, the classes that do not use
spell books or a familiar to manage

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
spell books or a familiar to manage
 

205
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,509
spell books or a familiar to manage
their spells should probably maintain a

206
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
their spells should probably maintain a
 

207
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,110
their spells should probably maintain a
personal spell list to record what

208
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
personal spell list to record what
 

209
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,830
personal spell list to record what
spells they have access to. It may not

210
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
spells they have access to. It may not
 

211
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,870
spells they have access to. It may not
be 100% required in all cases, but I

212
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
be 100% required in all cases, but I
 

213
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,629
be 100% required in all cases, but I
find it's better to have it and not need

00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
find it's better to have it and not need
 

215
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,710
find it's better to have it and not need
it than need it and not have it. Plus,

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
it than need it and not have it. Plus,
 

217
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,710
it than need it and not have it. Plus,
maintaining a personal spell list can

218
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
maintaining a personal spell list can
 

219
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,870
maintaining a personal spell list can
help you understand how this system

220
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
help you understand how this system
 

221
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,030
help you understand how this system
works.

222
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
works.
 

223
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,670
works.
So, this raises the question of how do

224
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
So, this raises the question of how do
 

225
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,629
So, this raises the question of how do
you gain access to spells? There are a

226
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
you gain access to spells? There are a
 

227
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,870
you gain access to spells? There are a
few general ways that I'll review, but

228
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
few general ways that I'll review, but
 

229
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,950
few general ways that I'll review, but
keep in mind that each class may have

230
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
keep in mind that each class may have
 

231
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,629
keep in mind that each class may have
their own methods of modifying how

232
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
their own methods of modifying how
 

233
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,110
their own methods of modifying how
spells are gained. So, specifics might

234
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
spells are gained. So, specifics might
 

235
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,990
spells are gained. So, specifics might
adjust these general methods. First, the

236
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
adjust these general methods. First, the
 

237
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,469
adjust these general methods. First, the
GM can grant access. For example, if

238
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
GM can grant access. For example, if
 

239
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,230
GM can grant access. For example, if
your character's backstory is that they

240
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
your character's backstory is that they
 

241
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,790
your character's backstory is that they
are a magical detective, your GM might

242
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
are a magical detective, your GM might
 

243
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,430
are a magical detective, your GM might
simply grant you access to locate, which

244
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
simply grant you access to locate, which
 

245
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,670
simply grant you access to locate, which
normally would not be available since it

246
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
normally would not be available since it
 

247
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,469
normally would not be available since it
is uncommon. Other typical reasons GMs

248
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
is uncommon. Other typical reasons GMs
 

249
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,870
is uncommon. Other typical reasons GMs
might grant access to uncommon spells is

250
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
might grant access to uncommon spells is
 

251
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,950
might grant access to uncommon spells is
if the character is from an ancestry,

252
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
if the character is from an ancestry,
 

253
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,110
if the character is from an ancestry,
culture, nationality, or organization

254
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
culture, nationality, or organization
 

255
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,390
culture, nationality, or organization
that is thematically tied to that spell.

256
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
that is thematically tied to that spell.

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,230
that is thematically tied to that spell.
Second, characters may gain access to

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
Second, characters may gain access to
 

259
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,310
Second, characters may gain access to
spells through class features. For

260
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
spells through class features. For
 

261
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,550
spells through class features. For
example, clerics gain access to spells

262
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
example, clerics gain access to spells
 

263
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,029
example, clerics gain access to spells
from their deity. A cleric who worships

264
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
from their deity. A cleric who worships
 

265
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,670
from their deity. A cleric who worships

his materials back, and can try again
after he levels up. And on a critical

486
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
after he levels up. And on a critical
 

487
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,310
after he levels up. And on a critical
failure, he fails to learn the spell,

488
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
failure, he fails to learn the spell,
 

489
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,870
failure, he fails to learn the spell,
loses half of his materials, and can

490
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
loses half of his materials, and can
 

491
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,190
loses half of his materials, and can
still try again after the next time he

492
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
still try again after the next time he
 

493
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,230
still try again after the next time he
levels up. And note that success means

494
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
levels up. And note that success means
 

495
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,190
levels up. And note that success means
he gains access to the spell, not that

496
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
he gains access to the spell, not that
 

497
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,750
he gains access to the spell, not that
he can immediately cast it. In other

498
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
he can immediately cast it. In other
 

499
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,310
he can immediately cast it. In other
words, Ring of Truth is added to Lim's

500
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
words, Ring of Truth is added to Lim's
 

501
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,110
words, Ring of Truth is added to Lim's
personal spell list, but not to his

502
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
personal spell list, but not to his
 

503
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,269
personal spell list, but not to his
spell repertoire. We'll discuss a little

504
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
spell repertoire. We'll discuss a little
 

505
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,030
spell repertoire. We'll discuss a little
bit later in this video what he needs to

506
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
bit later in this video what he needs to
 

507
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,269
bit later in this video what he needs to
do to then add it to his spell

508
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
do to then add it to his spell
 

509
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,910
do to then add it to his spell
repertoire so he can cast it. So, those

510
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
repertoire so he can cast it. So, those
 

511
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,949
repertoire so he can cast it. So, those
are the basics of learn a spell. But one

512
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
are the basics of learn a spell. But one
 

513
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,550
are the basics of learn a spell. But one
question that often comes up when

514
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
question that often comes up when
 

515
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,630
question that often comes up when
learning spells is if you learn a spell

516
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
learning spells is if you learn a spell
 

517
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,990
learning spells is if you learn a spell
from a scroll, is that scroll destroyed?

518
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
from a scroll, is that scroll destroyed?
 

519
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,990
from a scroll, is that scroll destroyed?
This was the way it worked in older

520
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
This was the way it worked in older
 

521
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,150
This was the way it worked in older
editions of the game. If a wizard found

522
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
editions of the game. If a wizard found
 

523
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,150
editions of the game. If a wizard found
a scroll while adventuring, they could

524
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
a scroll while adventuring, they could
 

525
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,470
a scroll while adventuring, they could
either use it to cast the spell from it

526
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
either use it to cast the spell from it
 

527
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,509
either use it to cast the spell from it
one time or transcribe the spell into

528
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
one time or transcribe the spell into
 

529
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,829
one time or transcribe the spell into
their spell book using a process that

530
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
their spell book using a process that
 

531
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,790
their spell book using a process that
destroyed the scroll. But in Pathfinder

532
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
destroyed the scroll. But in Pathfinder
 

533
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,110
destroyed the scroll. But in Pathfinder
second edition, that is not the case.

534
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
second edition, that is not the case.
 

535
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,350
second edition, that is not the case.
You can learn a spell from a scroll and

536
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
You can learn a spell from a scroll and
 

537
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,509
You can learn a spell from a scroll and
still use that scroll to cast the spell

538
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
still use that scroll to cast the spell
 

539
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,190
still use that scroll to cast the spell
later, at which point it would be

540
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
later, at which point it would be
 

541
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,430
later, at which point it would be
consumed as normal. There is one

542
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
consumed as normal. There is one
 

543
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,190
consumed as normal. There is one
important exception to this, however,

544
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
important exception to this, however,
 

545
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,750
important exception to this, however,
and that is for witches. A witch's

546
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
and that is for witches. A witch's
 

547
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,150
and that is for witches. A witch's
familiar may learn spells from a scroll,

548
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
familiar may learn spells from a scroll,
 

549
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,870
familiar may learn spells from a scroll,
but must physically consume the scroll

550
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
but must physically consume the scroll
 

551
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,670
but must physically consume the scroll
in order to do so.

552
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
in order to do so.
 

553
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,150
in order to do so.
Once you have access to spells per your

Once you have access to spells per your

Once you have access to spells per your
personal spell list, whether they are

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
personal spell list, whether they are
 

557
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,150
personal spell list, whether they are
common spells you start with, spells

558
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
common spells you start with, spells
 

559
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,069
common spells you start with, spells
provided by class features such as your

00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
provided by class features such as your
 

561
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,310
provided by class features such as your
deity, or you have used the learn a

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
deity, or you have used the learn a
 

563
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,630
deity, or you have used the learn a
spell activity, your class might then

564
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
spell activity, your class might then
 

565
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,949
spell activity, your class might then
need to have a way of managing them

566
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
need to have a way of managing them
 

567
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,350
need to have a way of managing them
before they can be cast using spell

568
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
before they can be cast using spell
 

569
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,590
before they can be cast using spell
slots. For example, you might carry a

570
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
slots. For example, you might carry a
 

571
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,069
slots. For example, you might carry a
spell book or have a spell repertoire.

572
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
spell book or have a spell repertoire.
 

573
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,230
spell book or have a spell repertoire.
I'll try to make this brief, but keep in

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll try to make this brief, but keep in
 

575
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,710
I'll try to make this brief, but keep in
mind again that every class has features

576
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
mind again that every class has features
 

577
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,190
mind again that every class has features
and feats that likely modify things, but

578

and feats that likely modify things, but

be covering classes that have been
 

585
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,230
be covering classes that have been
introduced to or updated for the

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
introduced to or updated for the

recording.
 

591
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,550
recording.
Let's start with the classes that use a

592
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
Let's start with the classes that use a
 

593
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,790
Let's start with the classes that use a
spell repertoire. All spontaneous

594
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
spell repertoire. All spontaneous
 

595
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,030
spell repertoire. All spontaneous
casters use a spell repertoire. So,

596
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
casters use a spell repertoire. So,
 

597
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,509
casters use a spell repertoire. So,
we're talking primarily about bards,

598
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
we're talking primarily about bards,
 

599
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,910
we're talking primarily about bards,
oracles, and sorcerers. A spell

600
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
oracles, and sorcerers. A spell
 

601
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,150
oracles, and sorcerers. A spell
repertoire is basically a list of the

602
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
repertoire is basically a list of the
 

603
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,870
repertoire is basically a list of the
spells they can cast using spell slots.

604
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
spells they can cast using spell slots.
 

605
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,790
spells they can cast using spell slots.
If the spell is not on their repertoire,

606
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
If the spell is not on their repertoire,
 

607
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,030
If the spell is not on their repertoire,
then they can't cast it. And if the

608
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
then they can't cast it. And if the
 

609
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,550
then they can't cast it. And if the
spell is not on their personal spell

610
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
spell is not on their personal spell
 

611
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,550
spell is not on their personal spell
list, then they can't add it to their

612
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
list, then they can't add it to their
 

613
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,190
list, then they can't add it to their
repertoire. But during the adventuring

614
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
repertoire. But during the adventuring
 

615
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,750
repertoire. But during the adventuring
day, they can spend their spell slots

616
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
day, they can spend their spell slots
 

617
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,670
day, they can spend their spell slots
whenever they like to cast spells that

618
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
whenever they like to cast spells that
 

619
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,629
whenever they like to cast spells that
are found on their repertoire. Also, the

620
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
are found on their repertoire. Also, the
 

621
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,470
are found on their repertoire. Also, the
number of spells contained in each cer's

622
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
number of spells contained in each cer's
 

623
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,430
number of spells contained in each cer's
repertoire is strictly limited. As the

624
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
repertoire is strictly limited. As the
 

625
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,509
repertoire is strictly limited. As the
caster levels up, they get to add new

626
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
caster levels up, they get to add new
 

627
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,590
caster levels up, they get to add new
spells to their repertoire so they can

628
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
spells to their repertoire so they can
 

629
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,190
spells to their repertoire so they can
keep pace with the amount of new spell

630
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
keep pace with the amount of new spell
 

631
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,670
keep pace with the amount of new spell
slots they get. And every time they

632
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
slots they get. And every time they
 

633
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,389
slots they get. And every time they
level up, they can adjust the spells in

634
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
level up, they can adjust the spells in
 

635
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,710
level up, they can adjust the spells in
their repertoire by swapping one spell

636
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
their repertoire by swapping one spell
 

637
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,629
their repertoire by swapping one spell
out that they don't want for another

638
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
out that they don't want for another
 

639
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,430
out that they don't want for another
spell of an equal rank. But this is very

640
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
spell of an equal rank. But this is very
 

641
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,470
spell of an equal rank. But this is very
limited. It's only one spell and only

642
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
limited. It's only one spell and only
 

643
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,190
limited. It's only one spell and only
done when leveling up. If they want to

644
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
done when leveling up. If they want to
 

645
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,430
done when leveling up. If they want to
adjust their repertoire more than that,

646
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
adjust their repertoire more than that,
 

647
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,829
adjust their repertoire more than that,
they'll need to formally retrain using

648
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
they'll need to formally retrain using
 

649
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,829
they'll need to formally retrain using
downtime. This calls for a week of

650
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
downtime. This calls for a week of
 

651
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,829
downtime. This calls for a week of
downtime to swap one spell in the

652
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
downtime to swap one spell in the
 

653
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,069
downtime to swap one spell in the
repertoire for another of equal rank and

654
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
repertoire for another of equal rank and
 

655
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,310
repertoire for another of equal rank and
may require a teacher and a monetary

656
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
may require a teacher and a monetary
 

657
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,870
may require a teacher and a monetary
cost at the GM's discretion. So, in our

658
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
cost at the GM's discretion. So, in our
 

659
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,350
cost at the GM's discretion. So, in our
earlier example of Lim the Bard, who

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
earlier example of Lim the Bard, who
 

661
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,389
earlier example of Lim the Bard, who
used the learn a spell activity to get

662
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
used the learn a spell activity to get
 

663
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,750
used the learn a spell activity to get
access to Ring of Truth, here is the way

664
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
access to Ring of Truth, here is the way
 

665
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,509
access to Ring of Truth, here is the way
that he would then move it from his

666
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
that he would then move it from his
 

667
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,509
that he would then move it from his
personal spell list to his repertoire.

668
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
personal spell list to his repertoire.
 

669
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,829
personal spell list to his repertoire.
He could either do that the next time he

670
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
He could either do that the next time he
 

671
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,790
He could either do that the next time he
levels up or he would have to spend a

672
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
levels up or he would have to spend a
 

673
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,750
levels up or he would have to spend a
week of downtime retraining and swap out

674
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
week of downtime retraining and swap out
 

675
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,069
week of downtime retraining and swap out
one spell from his repertoire for Ring

676
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
one spell from his repertoire for Ring
 

677
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,990
one spell from his repertoire for Ring
of Truth. And also note that some

678
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
of Truth. And also note that some
 

679
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,310
of Truth. And also note that some
classes provide spells that cannot be

680
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
classes provide spells that cannot be
 

681
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,790
classes provide spells that cannot be
swapped out. For example, certain spells

682
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
swapped out. For example, certain spells
 

683
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,030
swapped out. For example, certain spells
provided by a sorcerer's bloodline or an

684
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
provided by a sorcerer's bloodline or an
 

685
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,990
provided by a sorcerer's bloodline or an
Oracle's mystery. They have to stay on

686
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
Oracle's mystery. They have to stay on
 

687
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,550
Oracle's mystery. They have to stay on
the repertoire. But the bottom line is,

688
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
the repertoire. But the bottom line is,
 

689
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,790
the repertoire. But the bottom line is,
if your class uses a spell repertoire,

690
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
if your class uses a spell repertoire,
 

691
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,790
if your class uses a spell repertoire,
you can only cast spells included in

692
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
you can only cast spells included in
 

693
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,870
you can only cast spells included in
that repertoire, and those spells must

694
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
that repertoire, and those spells must
 

695
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,790
that repertoire, and those spells must
be spells you have access to, which is

696
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
be spells you have access to, which is
 

697
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,350
be spells you have access to, which is
why it's often a good idea to maintain a

698
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
why it's often a good idea to maintain a
 

699
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,150
why it's often a good idea to maintain a
separate personal spell list.

700
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
separate personal spell list.
 

701
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,230
separate personal spell list.
The next method of spell management we

702
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
The next method of spell management we
 

703
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,310
The next method of spell management we
should discuss is spell books.

704
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
should discuss is spell books.
 

705
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,949
should discuss is spell books.
Spellbooks are used primarily by wizards

706
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
Spellbooks are used primarily by wizards
 

707
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,509
Spellbooks are used primarily by wizards
and contain all the spells the wizard is

708
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
and contain all the spells the wizard is
 

709
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,710
and contain all the spells the wizard is
able to prepare each day. Unlike with

710
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
able to prepare each day. Unlike with
 

711
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,590
able to prepare each day. Unlike with
spell repertoars, there is no hard limit

712
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
spell repertoars, there is no hard limit
 

713
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,829
spell repertoars, there is no hard limit
to how many spells a typical spell book

714
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
to how many spells a typical spell book
 

715
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,230
to how many spells a typical spell book
can hold, which grants a wizard much

716
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
can hold, which grants a wizard much
 

717
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,710
can hold, which grants a wizard much
more variety in the spells they know,

718
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
more variety in the spells they know,
 

719
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,189
more variety in the spells they know,
but are limited by being able to only

720
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
but are limited by being able to only
 

721
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,509
but are limited by being able to only
prepare a limited number of spells each

722
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
prepare a limited number of spells each
 

723
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,550
prepare a limited number of spells each
day. So, wizards can only cast spells

724
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
day. So, wizards can only cast spells
 

725
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,550
day. So, wizards can only cast spells
they have prepared and can only prepare

726
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
they have prepared and can only prepare
 

727
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,470
they have prepared and can only prepare
spells found in their spell book. And

728
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
spells found in their spell book. And
 

729
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,790
spells found in their spell book. And
that spell book may only contain spells

730
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
that spell book may only contain spells
 

731
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,870
that spell book may only contain spells
that they have access to per their

that they have access to per their
 

733
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,350
that they have access to per their
personal spell list. But now, let's take

734
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
personal spell list. But now, let's take
 

735
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,750
personal spell list. But now, let's take
a moment to discuss every wizard's worst

736
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
a moment to discuss every wizard's worst
 

737
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,550
a moment to discuss every wizard's worst
nightmare. What happens if they lose

738
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
nightmare. What happens if they lose
 

739
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,790
nightmare. What happens if they lose
their spell book? There really are not a

740
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
their spell book? There really are not a
 

741
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,110
their spell book? There really are not a
lot of hard and fast rules for this, but

742
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
lot of hard and fast rules for this, but
 

743
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,509
lot of hard and fast rules for this, but
it appears that should this happen, the

744
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
it appears that should this happen, the
 

745
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,069
it appears that should this happen, the
wizard would be able to cast any spells

wizard would be able to cast any spells
 

747
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,230
wizard would be able to cast any spells
they already have prepared, but would

they already have prepared, but would
 

749
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,470
they already have prepared, but would
not be able to fill their spell slots

not be able to fill their spell slots
 

751
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,470
not be able to fill their spell slots
during their daily preparations. In

during their daily preparations. In
 

753
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,069
during their daily preparations. In
other words, they would not be able to

other words, they would not be able to
 

755
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,189
other words, they would not be able to
prepare any new spells. By raw, they

prepare any new spells. By raw, they
 

757
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,509
prepare any new spells. By raw, they
would need to use learn a spell to add

Next, let's talk about witches. Witches

Next, let's talk about witches. Witches
 

805
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,110
Next, let's talk about witches. Witches
basically work the same way as wizards,

806
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
basically work the same way as wizards,
 

807
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,269
basically work the same way as wizards,
except instead of keeping a spell book,

808
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
except instead of keeping a spell book,
 

809
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,350
except instead of keeping a spell book,
they have a familiar. Technically,

810
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
they have a familiar. Technically,
 

811
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,509
they have a familiar. Technically,
witches themselves do not know any

812
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
witches themselves do not know any
 

813
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,230
witches themselves do not know any
spells, but instead their familiar does,

814
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
spells, but instead their familiar does,
 

815
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,910
spells, but instead their familiar does,
and they must commune with their

816
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
and they must commune with their
 

817
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,069
and they must commune with their
familiar to prepare the spells they will

818
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
familiar to prepare the spells they will
 

819
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,550
familiar to prepare the spells they will
cast each day. This is why many people

820
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
cast each day. This is why many people
 

821
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,550
cast each day. This is why many people
refer to familiars as living spell

822
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
refer to familiars as living spell
 

823
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,790
refer to familiars as living spell
books. And they work pretty much the

824
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
books. And they work pretty much the
 

825
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,110
books. And they work pretty much the
same way. A witch can't cast a spell

826
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
same way. A witch can't cast a spell
 

827
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,110
same way. A witch can't cast a spell
they don't have prepared. They can't

828
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
they don't have prepared. They can't
 

829
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,030
they don't have prepared. They can't
prepare a spell their familiar doesn't

830
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
prepare a spell their familiar doesn't
 

831
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,350
prepare a spell their familiar doesn't
know, and their familiar can only learn

832
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
know, and their familiar can only learn
 

833
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,749
know, and their familiar can only learn
spells the witch has access to per a

834
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
spells the witch has access to per a
 

835
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,150
spells the witch has access to per a
personal spell list. The two key

836
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
personal spell list. The two key
 

837
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,990
personal spell list. The two key
differences for witches, though, are

838
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
differences for witches, though, are
 

839
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,310
differences for witches, though, are
unlike wizards, when they learn a spell

840
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
unlike wizards, when they learn a spell
 

841
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,629
unlike wizards, when they learn a spell
from a scroll, that scroll is destroyed

842
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
from a scroll, that scroll is destroyed
 

843
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,110
from a scroll, that scroll is destroyed
in the process. And should a witch lose

844
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
in the process. And should a witch lose
 

845
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,350
in the process. And should a witch lose
their familiar or their familiar dies,

846
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
their familiar or their familiar dies,
 

847
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,749
their familiar or their familiar dies,
their patron replaces that familiar the

848
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
their patron replaces that familiar the
 

849
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,150
their patron replaces that familiar the
next day, and the replacement familiar

850
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
next day, and the replacement familiar
 

851
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,150
next day, and the replacement familiar
knows all the spells the previous

852
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
knows all the spells the previous
 

853
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,629
knows all the spells the previous
familiar did. So there's significantly

854
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
familiar did. So there's significantly
 

855
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,790
familiar did. So there's significantly
less danger involved than a wizard who

856
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
less danger involved than a wizard who
 

857
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,590
less danger involved than a wizard who
loses their spell book.

858
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
loses their spell book.
 

859
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,550
loses their spell book.
Then we have clerics and druids. These

860
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
Then we have clerics and druids. These
 

861
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,949
Then we have clerics and druids. These
are the easiest to discuss because they

862
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
are the easiest to discuss because they
 

863
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,949
are the easiest to discuss because they
don't have any special requirements for

864
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
don't have any special requirements for
 

865
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,029
don't have any special requirements for
managing their spells. They don't need

866
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
managing their spells. They don't need
 

867
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,189
managing their spells. They don't need
to keep a spell repertoire or maintain a

868
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
to keep a spell repertoire or maintain a
 

869
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,470
to keep a spell repertoire or maintain a
spell book or do anything else. They get

870
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
spell book or do anything else. They get
 

871
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,470
spell book or do anything else. They get
their spells directly from the gods or

872
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
their spells directly from the gods or
 

873
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,949
their spells directly from the gods or
by communing with nature. So, if the

874
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
by communing with nature. So, if the
 

875
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,029
by communing with nature. So, if the
spell appears on their personal spell

876
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
spell appears on their personal spell
 

877
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,429
spell appears on their personal spell
list, then they can prepare it. It's

878
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
list, then they can prepare it. It's
 

879
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,750
list, then they can prepare it. It's
it's that easy.

880
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
it's that easy.
 

881
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,470
it's that easy.
And one last class to consider is the

882
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
And one last class to consider is the
 

883
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,750
And one last class to consider is the
animist. Animists are sort of a hybrid

884
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
animist. Animists are sort of a hybrid
 

885
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,750
animist. Animists are sort of a hybrid
spellcaster with the ability to cast

886
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
spellcaster with the ability to cast
 

887
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,950
spellcaster with the ability to cast
both prepared and spontaneous spells.

888
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
both prepared and spontaneous spells.
 

889
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,270
both prepared and spontaneous spells.
The animist draws magic from the divine

890
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
The animist draws magic from the divine
 

891
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,430
The animist draws magic from the divine
tradition, but they access it through

892
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
tradition, but they access it through
 

893
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,750
tradition, but they access it through
two different channels. The first is

894
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
two different channels. The first is
 

895
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,630
two different channels. The first is
called animist spellcasting. This is

896
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
called animist spellcasting. This is
 

897
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,950
called animist spellcasting. This is
their own ability to cast spells through

898
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
their own ability to cast spells through
 

899
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,070
their own ability to cast spells through
a prepared process similar to clerics.

900
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
a prepared process similar to clerics.
 

901
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,390
a prepared process similar to clerics.
Their second form of spell-casting is

902
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
Their second form of spell-casting is
 

903
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,510
Their second form of spell-casting is
called apparition spellcasting. Animus

904
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
called apparition spellcasting. Animus
 

905
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,070
called apparition spellcasting. Animus
bond with different spirits and each day

bond with different spirits and each day
 

907
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,230
bond with different spirits and each day
they can spontaneously cast spells

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
they can spontaneously cast spells

all these spells together form a
