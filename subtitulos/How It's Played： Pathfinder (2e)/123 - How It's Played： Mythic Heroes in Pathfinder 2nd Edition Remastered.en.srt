then this system may be for you. We're

then this system may be for you. We're
 

17
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,109
then this system may be for you. We're
going to break down what mythic

00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
going to break down what mythic
 

19
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,349
going to break down what mythic
characters are, how they work, and how

20
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
characters are, how they work, and how
 

21
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,509
characters are, how they work, and how
you can use them to tell truly epic

stories.
 

25
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,150
stories.
So, what exactly is a mythic character?

26
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
So, what exactly is a mythic character?
 

27
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,150
So, what exactly is a mythic character?
In a standard Pathfinder game, your

00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
In a standard Pathfinder game, your
 

29
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,709
In a standard Pathfinder game, your
character is already a hero capable of

character is already a hero capable of
 

31
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,350
character is already a hero capable of
fighting monsters and saving kingdoms.

32
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
fighting monsters and saving kingdoms.
 

33
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,150
fighting monsters and saving kingdoms.
But mythic adventures are inspired by

But mythic adventures are inspired by
 

35
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,950
But mythic adventures are inspired by
stories that go even further. Think of

36
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
stories that go even further. Think of
 

37
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,110
stories that go even further. Think of
the legends of heroes who wrestle with

38
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
the legends of heroes who wrestle with
 

39
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,510
the legends of heroes who wrestle with
gods or alter the very landscape with

40
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
gods or alter the very landscape with
 

41
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,150
gods or alter the very landscape with
their power. Mythic characters possess

42
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
their power. Mythic characters possess
 

43
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,830
their power. Mythic characters possess
fantastical powers that are often

44
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
fantastical powers that are often
 

45
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,709
fantastical powers that are often
unbound by normal limits. The most

46
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
unbound by normal limits. The most
 

47
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,790
unbound by normal limits. The most
important distinction is that mythic

48
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
important distinction is that mythic
 

49
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,110
important distinction is that mythic
characters have a much more profound

50
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
characters have a much more profound
 

51
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,830
characters have a much more profound
ability to directly affect the narrative

00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
ability to directly affect the narrative

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,350
ability to directly affect the narrative
of the game world. They are figures of a

54
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
of the game world. They are figures of a
 

55
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,910
of the game world. They are figures of a
legend and the rules give you the tools

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
legend and the rules give you the tools
 

57
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,990
legend and the rules give you the tools
to make that a mechanical reality.

58
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
to make that a mechanical reality.
 

59
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,030
to make that a mechanical reality.
So, how does a character become mythic?

60
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
So, how does a character become mythic?
 

61
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,870
So, how does a character become mythic?
This isn't something that you just

62
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
This isn't something that you just
 

63
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,190
This isn't something that you just
choose at first level. In fact, you

64
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
choose at first level. In fact, you
 

65
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,270
choose at first level. In fact, you
don't get to choose becoming mythic at

66
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
don't get to choose becoming mythic at
 

67
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,230
don't get to choose becoming mythic at
all. Instead, it's a decision the GM

68
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
all. Instead, it's a decision the GM
 

69
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,310
all. Instead, it's a decision the GM
makes for all the players in the

70
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
makes for all the players in the
 

71
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,550
makes for all the players in the
campaign. And it happens in the story

72
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
campaign. And it happens in the story
 

73
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,550
campaign. And it happens in the story
when your character experiences what is

74
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
when your character experiences what is
 

75
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,350
when your character experiences what is
known as their calling. This pivotal

76
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
known as their calling. This pivotal
 

77
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,749
known as their calling. This pivotal
moment can happen in many ways. Maybe

78
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
moment can happen in many ways. Maybe
 

79
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,310
moment can happen in many ways. Maybe
your character is directly infused with

80
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
your character is directly infused with
 

81
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,030
your character is directly infused with
power by a deity. Maybe they survive

82
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
power by a deity. Maybe they survive
 

83
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,910
power by a deity. Maybe they survive
exposure to a mythic artifact. Or maybe

84
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
exposure to a mythic artifact. Or maybe
 

85
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,069
exposure to a mythic artifact. Or maybe
they're caught in a worldshaking event

86
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
they're caught in a worldshaking event
 

87
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,789
they're caught in a worldshaking event
like the gods reign where the power of a

88
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
like the gods reign where the power of a
 

89
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,109
like the gods reign where the power of a
dead god spills across the land and

90
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
dead god spills across the land and
 

91
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,069
dead god spills across the land and
imbuss people with a divine spark.

92
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
imbuss people with a divine spark.
 

93
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,630
imbuss people with a divine spark.
However it happens, this calling is the

94
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
However it happens, this calling is the
 

95
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,190
However it happens, this calling is the
event that awakens your latent potential

96
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
event that awakens your latent potential
 

97
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,990
event that awakens your latent potential
and sets you on the path to legend. And

98
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
and sets you on the path to legend. And
 

99
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,230
and sets you on the path to legend. And
we'll talk more about callings in just a

100
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
we'll talk more about callings in just a
 

101
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,310
we'll talk more about callings in just a
moment. But first, there are a couple

102
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
moment. But first, there are a couple
 

103
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,869
moment. But first, there are a couple
mechanical rules we should discuss.

104
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
mechanical rules we should discuss.
 

105
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,589
mechanical rules we should discuss.
First, the fuel for your new abilities

106
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
First, the fuel for your new abilities
 

107
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,869
First, the fuel for your new abilities
is called mythic points. You spend them

108
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
is called mythic points. You spend them
 

109
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,190
is called mythic points. You spend them
to power your mythic feats, cast mythic

to power your mythic feats, cast mythic
spells, or activate mythic items. And

00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
spells, or activate mythic items. And
 

113
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,869
spells, or activate mythic items. And
this is important for a mythic

114
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
this is important for a mythic
 

115
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,390
this is important for a mythic
character. Mythic points replace your

116
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
character. Mythic points replace your
 

117
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,510
character. Mythic points replace your
hero points. You don't gain or use hero

118
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,520
hero points. You don't gain or use hero
 

119
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,150
hero points. You don't gain or use hero
points at all. You start every game

120
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
points at all. You start every game
 

121
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,550
points at all. You start every game
session with three mythic points, and

122
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
session with three mythic points, and
 

123
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,470
session with three mythic points, and
you can never have more than three at a

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
you can never have more than three at a
 

125
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,509
you can never have more than three at a
time. And then during a session, you can

00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
time. And then during a session, you can
 

127
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,350
time. And then during a session, you can
regain mythic points by performing

Another new mechanic that shapes mythic

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
Another new mechanic that shapes mythic
 

157
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,949
Another new mechanic that shapes mythic
characters is mythic proficiency. This

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
bonus is 10 plus your level. To put that
 

167
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,350
bonus is 10 plus your level. To put that
in perspective, legendary proficiency is

168
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
in perspective, legendary proficiency is
 

169
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,750
in perspective, legendary proficiency is
only eight plus your level. But you

170
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
only eight plus your level. But you
 

171
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,470
only eight plus your level. But you
don't just gain this new level of mythic

172
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
don't just gain this new level of mythic
 

173
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,470
don't just gain this new level of mythic
proficiency in a skill the way you may

174
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
proficiency in a skill the way you may
 

175
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,149
proficiency in a skill the way you may
be used to increasing proficiency

176
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
be used to increasing proficiency
 

177
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,190
be used to increasing proficiency
levels. Instead, you use mythic

178
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
levels. Instead, you use mythic
 

179
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,070
levels. Instead, you use mythic
proficiency only when a specific mythic

180
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
proficiency only when a specific mythic
 

181
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,630
proficiency only when a specific mythic
ability tells you to, and it almost

182
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
ability tells you to, and it almost
 

183
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,949
ability tells you to, and it almost
always costs you a mythic point to do

184
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
always costs you a mythic point to do
 

185
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,830
always costs you a mythic point to do
so. For example, let's look at hands

186
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
so. For example, let's look at hands
 

187
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,110
so. For example, let's look at hands
that onw weave disaster. Say you are a

188
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
that onw weave disaster. Say you are a
 

189
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,190
that onw weave disaster. Say you are a
thirdle rogue and have expert

190
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
thirdle rogue and have expert
 

191
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,990
thirdle rogue and have expert
proficiency in the thievery skill for a

00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
thievery bonus of plus 10. With this
 

195
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,949
thievery bonus of plus 10. With this
feat, you can spend a mythic point to

196
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
feat, you can spend a mythic point to
 

197
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,670
feat, you can spend a mythic point to
make a disabled device check with mythic

198
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
make a disabled device check with mythic
 

199
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,430
make a disabled device check with mythic
proficiency for a plus 16 bonus, even if

200
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
proficiency for a plus 16 bonus, even if
 

201
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,590

the lock you are trying to pick requires
master proficiency.

204
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
master proficiency.
 

205
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,469
master proficiency.
Mythic characters are legends, and

206
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
Mythic characters are legends, and
 

207
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,350
Mythic characters are legends, and
legends are notoriously hard to kill.

208
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
legends are notoriously hard to kill.
 

209
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,749
legends are notoriously hard to kill.
Therefore, the mythic rules change how

210
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
Therefore, the mythic rules change how
 

211
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,710
Therefore, the mythic rules change how
dying works. Normally, when your dying

212
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
dying works. Normally, when your dying
 

213
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,350
dying works. Normally, when your dying
condition reaches four, you're dead. But

214
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
condition reaches four, you're dead. But
 

215
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,189
condition reaches four, you're dead. But
for a mythic character, that's not the

216
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
for a mythic character, that's not the
 

217
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,070
for a mythic character, that's not the
end. In the case of mythic characters,

218
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
end. In the case of mythic characters,
 

219
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,469
end. In the case of mythic characters,
when your dying value would reach four

220
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
when your dying value would reach four
 

221
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,870
when your dying value would reach four
or five if you have the die hard feet,

222
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
or five if you have the die hard feet,
 

223
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,749
or five if you have the die hard feet,
you instead stabilize with zero hit

224
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
you instead stabilize with zero hit
 

225
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,469
you instead stabilize with zero hit
points and increase your doomed value by

226
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
points and increase your doomed value by
 

227
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,350
points and increase your doomed value by
one. You're not dead, but you're one

228
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
one. You're not dead, but you're one
 

229
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,550
one. You're not dead, but you're one
step closer to a final end. A mythic

230
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
step closer to a final end. A mythic
 

231
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,510
step closer to a final end. A mythic
character only dies permanently when

232
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
character only dies permanently when
 

233
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,950
character only dies permanently when
their doomed value reaches four. And as

234
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
their doomed value reaches four. And as
 

235
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,430
their doomed value reaches four. And as
normal, a mythic character's doomed

236
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
normal, a mythic character's doomed
 

237
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,150
normal, a mythic character's doomed
value decreases by one each time they

238
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
value decreases by one each time they
 

239
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,390
value decreases by one each time they
get a full night's rest. So, this gives

240
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
get a full night's rest. So, this gives
 

241
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,950
get a full night's rest. So, this gives
you an incredible amount of resilience,

242
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
you an incredible amount of resilience,
 

243
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,350
you an incredible amount of resilience,
letting you survive what would kill any

244
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
letting you survive what would kill any
 

245
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,430
letting you survive what would kill any
normal hero.

246
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
normal hero.
 

247
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,629
normal hero.
And since this can be a little

248
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
And since this can be a little
 

249
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,029
And since this can be a little
confusing, let's break it down. When a

250
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
confusing, let's break it down. When a
 

251
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,510
confusing, let's break it down. When a
mythic character is reduced to zero hit

252
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
mythic character is reduced to zero hit
 

253
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,909
mythic character is reduced to zero hit
points, they fall unconscious as normal

254
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
points, they fall unconscious as normal
 

255
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,950
points, they fall unconscious as normal
and begin making recovery checks. Once

256
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
and begin making recovery checks. Once
 

257
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,510
and begin making recovery checks. Once
they fail enough recovery checks to die,

258
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
they fail enough recovery checks to die,
 

259
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,909
they fail enough recovery checks to die,
which is normally at dying four, they

260
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
which is normally at dying four, they
 

261
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,749
which is normally at dying four, they
instead stabilize, have zero hit points,

262
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
instead stabilize, have zero hit points,
 

263
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,189
instead stabilize, have zero hit points,
increase their doomed value by one, and

264
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
increase their doomed value by one, and
 

265
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,310
increase their doomed value by one, and
increase their wounded value by one.

266
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
increase their wounded value by one.
 

267
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,230
increase their wounded value by one.
Now, let's say they get healed in the

268
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
Now, let's say they get healed in the
 

269
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,150
Now, let's say they get healed in the
middle of the same fight and are back on

270
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
middle of the same fight and are back on
 

271
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,189
middle of the same fight and are back on
their feet. A few rounds later, they

272
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
their feet. A few rounds later, they
 

273
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,390
their feet. A few rounds later, they
again get reduced to zero hit points.

274
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
again get reduced to zero hit points.
 

275
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,870
again get reduced to zero hit points.
They fall unconscious and unless it was

276
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
They fall unconscious and unless it was
 

277
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,950
They fall unconscious and unless it was
a critical hit that brought them down,

278
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
a critical hit that brought them down,
 

279
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,230
a critical hit that brought them down,
they have the dying two condition. Dying

280
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
they have the dying two condition. Dying
 

281
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,430
they have the dying two condition. Dying
two because they are wounded one, which

282
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
two because they are wounded one, which
 

283
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,070
two because they are wounded one, which
increases the dying value as normal.

284
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
increases the dying value as normal.
 

285
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,550
increases the dying value as normal.
Also, since they are doomed one, the

286
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
Also, since they are doomed one, the
 

287
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,510
Also, since they are doomed one, the
threshold for death is now dying three

288
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
threshold for death is now dying three
 

289
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,469
threshold for death is now dying three
instead of dying four. If they fail a

290
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
instead of dying four. If they fail a
 

291
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,469
instead of dying four. If they fail a
recovery check, they move to dying

292
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
recovery check, they move to dying
 

293
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,790
recovery check, they move to dying
three, which would normally kill them.

294
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
three, which would normally kill them.
 

295
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,629
three, which would normally kill them.
But because they are mythic, they

296
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
But because they are mythic, they
 

297
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,350
But because they are mythic, they
instead stabilize again with zero hit

298
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
instead stabilize again with zero hit
 

299
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,230
instead stabilize again with zero hit
points and increase both their wounded

300
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
points and increase both their wounded
 

301
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,270
points and increase both their wounded
and doomed values by one, giving them

302
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
and doomed values by one, giving them
 

303
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,189
and doomed values by one, giving them
wounded two and doomed two. If they are

304
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
wounded two and doomed two. If they are
 

305
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,350
wounded two and doomed two. If they are
revived in the same fight and get

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
revived in the same fight and get
 

307
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,070
revived in the same fight and get
reduced to zero hit points yet again,

308
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
reduced to zero hit points yet again,
 

309
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,870
reduced to zero hit points yet again,
they start at dying three because of

310
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
they start at dying three because of
 

311
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,029
they start at dying three because of
their wounded two condition. And the

00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
their wounded two condition. And the
 

313
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,830
their wounded two condition. And the
threshold for death is now dying too

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
threshold for death is now dying too
 

315
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,550
threshold for death is now dying too
because of the doomed two condition.

because of the doomed two condition.
 

317
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,029
because of the doomed two condition.
Meaning they immediately stabilize and

Meaning they immediately stabilize and
 

319
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,590
Meaning they immediately stabilize and
increase their wounded and doomed values

320
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:55,600
increase their wounded and doomed values
 

321
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,230
increase their wounded and doomed values
to three. And if they take any more

to three. And if they take any more
 

323
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,110
to three. And if they take any more

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,510
before we get into those details, let's
cover mythic character progression. The

Your mythic calling is the first and

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,949
Your mythic calling is the first and
most important choice you'll make. This

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
most important choice you'll make. This

their calling. A cleric in that group
 

447
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,990
their calling. A cleric in that group
may have chosen the caretaker's calling
