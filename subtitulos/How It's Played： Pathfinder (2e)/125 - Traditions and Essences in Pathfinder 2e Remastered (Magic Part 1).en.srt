168
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
and otherwise access the ephemeral in a
 

169
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,229
and otherwise access the ephemeral in a
systematic way. And when I read that to

170
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
systematic way. And when I read that to
 

171
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,149
systematic way. And when I read that to
players, their response is always the

172
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
players, their response is always the
 

173
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,550
players, their response is always the
same. They always ask, "What does that

174
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
same. They always ask, "What does that
 

175
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,070
same. They always ask, "What does that
actually mean?" Oult magic is the realm

176
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
actually mean?" Oult magic is the realm
 

177
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,270
actually mean?" Oult magic is the realm
of witches, hags, cosmic entities,

178
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
of witches, hags, cosmic entities,
 

179
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,070
of witches, hags, cosmic entities,
bizarre beings like great old ones and

180
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
bizarre beings like great old ones and
 

181
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,990
bizarre beings like great old ones and
althus and also spirits, haunted houses

182
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
althus and also spirits, haunted houses
 

183
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,229
althus and also spirits, haunted houses
and many creatures with the aberration

184
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
and many creatures with the aberration
 

185
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,550
and many creatures with the aberration
trait. One of my players has taken to

186
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
trait. One of my players has taken to
 

187
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,750
trait. One of my players has taken to
calling it spooky magic. And I think in

188
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
calling it spooky magic. And I think in
 

189
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,710
calling it spooky magic. And I think in
most cases that kind of sums up occult

190
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
most cases that kind of sums up occult
 

191
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,589
most cases that kind of sums up occult
magic nicely. Occult magic is spooky

192
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
magic nicely. Occult magic is spooky
 

193
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,949
magic nicely. Occult magic is spooky
magic. But bards also practice occult

194
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
magic. But bards also practice occult
 

195
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,949
magic. But bards also practice occult
magic. And they're not typically

196
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
magic. And they're not typically
 

197
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,350
magic. And they're not typically
considered to be spooky. And this leads

198
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
considered to be spooky. And this leads
 

199
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,749
considered to be spooky. And this leads
one of my groups to refer to oultism as

200
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
one of my groups to refer to oultism as
 

201
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,949
one of my groups to refer to oultism as
quote other magic. As in there's arcane,

202
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
quote other magic. As in there's arcane,
 

203
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,590
quote other magic. As in there's arcane,
divine, and primal magic. And if it

204
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
divine, and primal magic. And if it
 

205
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,230
divine, and primal magic. And if it
doesn't fit into one of those easier to

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
doesn't fit into one of those easier to
 

207
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,550
doesn't fit into one of those easier to
understand traditions, then it's occult

208
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
understand traditions, then it's occult
 

209
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,870
understand traditions, then it's occult
or other magic. Whether you want to

210
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
or other magic. Whether you want to
 

211
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,510
or other magic. Whether you want to
think of it as a cult or spooky or other

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
think of it as a cult or spooky or other
 

213
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,749
think of it as a cult or spooky or other
magic, just know that this form of magic

00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
magic, just know that this form of magic
 

215
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,310
magic, just know that this form of magic
is primarily practiced by bards,

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
is primarily practiced by bards,
 

217
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,390
is primarily practiced by bards,
witches, and some sorcerers with the

aberant and hag bloodlines.
In addition to the traditions, there are

222
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
In addition to the traditions, there are
 

223
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,189
In addition to the traditions, there are
also four essences of magic. I'm not

224
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
also four essences of magic. I'm not
 

225
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,590
also four essences of magic. I'm not
going to spend too much time on this as

226
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
going to spend too much time on this as
 

227
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,070
going to spend too much time on this as
the essences don't really impact the

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
the essences don't really impact the
 

229
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,310
the essences don't really impact the
mechanics of the game, but it is helpful

230
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
mechanics of the game, but it is helpful
 

231
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,710
mechanics of the game, but it is helpful
to know what the essences are and how

232
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
to know what the essences are and how
 

233
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,629
to know what the essences are and how
they relate to the four magical

00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
they relate to the four magical
 

235
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,110
they relate to the four magical

Golarian say that all of existence and
reality is composed of some combination

reality is composed of some combination
 

241
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,070
reality is composed of some combination
of four essences and those are matter,

242
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
of four essences and those are matter,
 

243
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,590
of four essences and those are matter,
spirit, mind, and life. The essence of

244
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
spirit, mind, and life. The essence of
 

245
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,390
spirit, mind, and life. The essence of
matter or material essence deals with

the physical world. The essence of

spirit deals with the soul or the
 

251

spirit deals with the soul or the
non-material and immortal parts of a

non-material and immortal parts of a
 

253
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,909
non-material and immortal parts of a
living being. The mind essence allows

254
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
living being. The mind essence allows
 

255
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,749
living being. The mind essence allows
thinking creatures to have rational

256
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
thinking creatures to have rational
 

257
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,990
thinking creatures to have rational
thought and for animals to behave on

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
thought and for animals to behave on
 

259
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,390
thought and for animals to behave on
instinct. And the life essence

260
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
instinct. And the life essence
 

261
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,029
instinct. And the life essence
represents the animating universal force

262
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
represents the animating universal force
 

263
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,909
represents the animating universal force
within all living things. Whereas matter

264
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
within all living things. Whereas matter
 

265
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,790
within all living things. Whereas matter
provides the base materials for a body,

266
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
provides the base materials for a body,
 

267
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,230
provides the base materials for a body,
life keeps it alive and well. Now, the

268
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
life keeps it alive and well. Now, the
 

269
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,790
life keeps it alive and well. Now, the
reason why it's helpful for players to

270
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
reason why it's helpful for players to
 

271
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,430
reason why it's helpful for players to
know about the four essences is because

272
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
know about the four essences is because
 

273
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,390
know about the four essences is because
each tradition focuses on exactly two of

274
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
each tradition focuses on exactly two of
 

275
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,390
each tradition focuses on exactly two of
these. And understanding that

276
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
these. And understanding that
 

277
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,310
these. And understanding that
relationship will help shed some light

278
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
relationship will help shed some light
 

279
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,790
relationship will help shed some light
on what kind of spells each tradition

280
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
on what kind of spells each tradition
 

281
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,350
on what kind of spells each tradition
excels with. The arcane tradition

282
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
excels with. The arcane tradition
 

283
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,950
excels with. The arcane tradition
focuses on the matter and mind essences.

284
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
focuses on the matter and mind essences.
 

285
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,590
focuses on the matter and mind essences.
Arcane spellcasters have a very, very

286
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
Arcane spellcasters have a very, very
 

287
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,830
Arcane spellcasters have a very, very
broad selection of spells, but are

288
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
broad selection of spells, but are
 

289
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,150
broad selection of spells, but are
extremely limited when it comes to the

290
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
extremely limited when it comes to the
 

291
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,550
extremely limited when it comes to the
essences of life and spirit. So, they're

292
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
essences of life and spirit. So, they're
 

293
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,309
essences of life and spirit. So, they're
not very well equipped when it comes to

294
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
not very well equipped when it comes to
 

295
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,230
not very well equipped when it comes to
healing. That's not to say a wizard

296
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
healing. That's not to say a wizard
 

297
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,029
healing. That's not to say a wizard
can't cast some life or spirit essence

298
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
can't cast some life or spirit essence
 

299
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,350
can't cast some life or spirit essence
spells, but there are far fewer spells

300
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
spells, but there are far fewer spells
 

301
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,510
spells, but there are far fewer spells
of those essences on the arcane spell

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
of those essences on the arcane spell
 

303
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,909
of those essences on the arcane spell
list than spells that deal with the

304
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
list than spells that deal with the
 

305
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,950
list than spells that deal with the
matter and mind essences. The divine

306
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
matter and mind essences. The divine
 

307
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,110
matter and mind essences. The divine
tradition is the polar opposite of the

308
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
tradition is the polar opposite of the
 

309
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,510
tradition is the polar opposite of the
arcane tradition in that the divine

310
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
arcane tradition in that the divine
 

311
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,469
arcane tradition in that the divine
spell list focuses on the spirit and

312
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
spell list focuses on the spirit and
 

313
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,110
spell list focuses on the spirit and
life essences. Which isn't to say they

314
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
life essences. Which isn't to say they
 

315
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,790
life essences. Which isn't to say they
don't also have spells that lend

316
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
don't also have spells that lend
 

317
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,830
don't also have spells that lend
themselves to other essences, but divine

318
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
themselves to other essences, but divine
 

319
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,150
themselves to other essences, but divine
casters really shine when it comes to

320
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
casters really shine when it comes to
 

321
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,390
casters really shine when it comes to
matters of healing and the immortal

322
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
matters of healing and the immortal
 

323
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,670
matters of healing and the immortal
soul. The occult tradition focuses on

324
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
soul. The occult tradition focuses on
 

325
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,550
soul. The occult tradition focuses on
the spirit and mind essences. Therefore,

326
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
the spirit and mind essences. Therefore,
 

327
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,270
the spirit and mind essences. Therefore,
we can expect bards and witches to excel

328
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
