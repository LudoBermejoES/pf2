segment so that they are all chained
together. And it's not enough for the

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
together. And it's not enough for the
 

113
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,270
together. And it's not enough for the
segments to be diagonal from one

segments to be diagonal from one
 

115
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,470
segments to be diagonal from one
another. They must share a border with

116
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
another. They must share a border with
 

117
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,070
another. They must share a border with
each other. For example, this is a legal

118
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
each other. For example, this is a legal
 

119
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,750
each other. For example, this is a legal
shape for a troop. and so is this or

120
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:40,760
shape for a troop. and so is this or
 

121
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,430
shape for a troop. and so is this or
this. But this is not a legal shape, nor

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
this. But this is not a legal shape, nor
 

123

this. But this is not a legal shape, nor
is

is
 

125
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,509
is
this. Also, it's important to note that

126
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
this. Also, it's important to note that
 

127
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,550
this. Also, it's important to note that
as a troop suffers damage, it shrinks in

128
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
as a troop suffers damage, it shrinks in
 

129
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,190
as a troop suffers damage, it shrinks in
size, which makes sense. As members of

size, which makes sense. As members of
 

131
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,430

the troop are whittleled away, the troop

132
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
the troop are whittleled away, the troop
 

133
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,150
the troop are whittleled away, the troop
itself becomes smaller and smaller. This

134
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,160
itself becomes smaller and smaller. This
 

135
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,790
itself becomes smaller and smaller. This
is represented in the rules by including

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,589
is represented in the rules by including
two hit point thresholds.

two hit point thresholds.
We see here that a city guard squadron

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
We see here that a city guard squadron
 

141
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,270
We see here that a city guard squadron
starts with 75 hit points and a

parenthetical noting four
 

145
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,229
parenthetical noting four
segments. And then we see the two

146
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:17,239
segments. And then we see the two
 

147
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,309
segments. And then we see the two
thresholds. The first threshold says 50

148
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
thresholds. The first threshold says 50
 

149
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,949
thresholds. The first threshold says 50
and three segments, meaning that after

and three segments, meaning that after
 

151
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,589
and three segments, meaning that after
the cityguard squadron as a whole has

the cityguard squadron as a whole has
 

153
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,309
the cityguard squadron as a whole has
suffered 25 points of damage, one of its

154
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
suffered 25 points of damage, one of its
 

155
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,030
suffered 25 points of damage, one of its
four segments is removed from the map.

156
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
four segments is removed from the map.
 

157
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,509
four segments is removed from the map.
And after it suffers another 25 points

158
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
And after it suffers another 25 points
 

159
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,309
And after it suffers another 25 points
of damage, it hits its second hit point

160
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
of damage, it hits its second hit point
 

161
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,390
of damage, it hits its second hit point
threshold and loses another

162
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:39,400
threshold and loses another
 

163
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,910

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
segment. There are some special rules
 

165
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,710
segment. There are some special rules
regarding how troops suffer damage. The

166
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
regarding how troops suffer damage. The
 

167
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,070
regarding how troops suffer damage. The
troop as a whole has a single pool of

168
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
troop as a whole has a single pool of
 

169
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,229
troop as a whole has a single pool of
hit points that is shared among all of

170
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
hit points that is shared among all of
 

171
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,110
hit points that is shared among all of
its segments. Meaning damage is

172
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
its segments. Meaning damage is
 

173
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,190
its segments. Meaning damage is
abstracted so that if one segment is

174
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
abstracted so that if one segment is
 

175
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,670
abstracted so that if one segment is
targeted for an attack and hit, its

176
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
targeted for an attack and hit, its
 

177
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,229
targeted for an attack and hit, its
damage is applied to the entire troop

178
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
damage is applied to the entire troop
 

179
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,789
damage is applied to the entire troop
and not specifically the one segment

180
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
and not specifically the one segment
 

181
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,509
and not specifically the one segment
that was targeted. Each time a troop's

182
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
that was targeted. Each time a troop's
 

183
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,509
that was targeted. Each time a troop's
hit points is pushed past one of its

184
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
hit points is pushed past one of its
 

185
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,869
hit points is pushed past one of its
thresholds, a segment is removed. By

186
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
thresholds, a segment is removed. By
 

187
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,030
thresholds, a segment is removed. By
raw, the player who deals that damage

188
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
raw, the player who deals that damage
 

189
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,429
raw, the player who deals that damage
that pushes the troop past a threshold

190
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
that pushes the troop past a threshold
 

191
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,590
that pushes the troop past a threshold
typically gets to decide which segment

192
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
typically gets to decide which segment
 

193
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,310
typically gets to decide which segment
is removed. But I find it much easier

194
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
is removed. But I find it much easier
 

195
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,550
is removed. But I find it much easier
for the GM to be the one who makes that

196
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
for the GM to be the one who makes that
 

197
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,270
for the GM to be the one who makes that
call because sometimes the abstracted

198
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
call because sometimes the abstracted
 

199
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,909
call because sometimes the abstracted
nature of troop combat can be confusing

200
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
nature of troop combat can be confusing
 

201
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,310
nature of troop combat can be confusing
for some players. For example, if

202
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
for some players. For example, if
 

203
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,710
for some players. For example, if
Valeros attacks the troop here with a

204
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
Valeros attacks the troop here with a
 

205
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,189
Valeros attacks the troop here with a
melee attack and deals enough damage to

206
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
melee attack and deals enough damage to
 

207
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,350
melee attack and deals enough damage to
push it past its first threshold,

208
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
push it past its first threshold,
 

209
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,230
push it past its first threshold,
Valeros's player might logically declare

210
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
Valeros's player might logically declare
 

211
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,390
Valeros's player might logically declare
that this segment be the one that's

212
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
that this segment be the one that's
 

213
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,510
that this segment be the one that's
removed. However, it can't be removed

214
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
removed. However, it can't be removed
 

215
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,510
removed. However, it can't be removed
because doing so would leave the troop

216
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
because doing so would leave the troop
 

217
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,550
because doing so would leave the troop
in an illegal formation on the map.

218
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
in an illegal formation on the map.
 

219
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,550
in an illegal formation on the map.
Remember, each segment must share a

220
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
Remember, each segment must share a
 

221
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,110
Remember, each segment must share a
border with another segment. So, the

222
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
border with another segment. So, the
 

223
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,870
border with another segment. So, the
segment that's removed must be one of

224
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:57,880
segment that's removed must be one of
 

225
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,670
segment that's removed must be one of
these, and that can feel

226
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
these, and that can feel
 

227
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,150
these, and that can feel
counterintuitive for players. So, James

228
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
counterintuitive for players. So, James
 

229
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,070
counterintuitive for players. So, James
will need to describe what happens

230
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
will need to describe what happens
 

231
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,870
will need to describe what happens
within the narrative. As Valerus chops

232
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
within the narrative. As Valerus chops
 

233
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,790
within the narrative. As Valerus chops
down the foes in front of him, more

234
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
down the foes in front of him, more
 

235
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,749
down the foes in front of him, more
soldiers rush in to take their place,

236
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
soldiers rush in to take their place,
 

237
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,749
soldiers rush in to take their place,
which has the result of shrinking the

border. Also, every time a troop is
reduced to one of his thresholds, the

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
reduced to one of his thresholds, the
 

247
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,390
reduced to one of his thresholds, the
listed value for that threshold becomes

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
listed value for that threshold becomes
 

249
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,590
listed value for that threshold becomes
the troop's new maximum hit point value.

the troop's new maximum hit point value.

We should also take a look at how troops

290
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
We should also take a look at how troops
 

291
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,350
We should also take a look at how troops
deal with non-damaging effects. Troops

292
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
deal with non-damaging effects. Troops
 

293
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,909
deal with non-damaging effects. Troops
are usually immune to any non-damaging

294
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
are usually immune to any non-damaging
 

295
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,230
are usually immune to any non-damaging
effect that only targets a single

296
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
effect that only targets a single
 

297
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,950
effect that only targets a single
creature, like a charm spell or using

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
creature, like a charm spell or using

the intimidate skill to
 

301
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,909
the intimidate skill to
demoralize. However, non-damaging

302
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
demoralize. However, non-damaging
 

303
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,230
demoralize. However, non-damaging
abilities that target at least five

304
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
abilities that target at least five
 

305
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,670
abilities that target at least five
creatures can affect an entire segment.

306
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
creatures can affect an entire segment.
 

307
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,390
creatures can affect an entire segment.
Abilities that target 10 creatures can

Abilities that target 10 creatures can
 

309
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,189
Abilities that target 10 creatures can
affect two segments. And abilities that

00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
affect two segments. And abilities that
 

311
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,909
affect two segments. And abilities that
target 20 or more creatures can affect

326
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
effect would prevent a segment from
 

327
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,029
effect would prevent a segment from
acting, causing them to flee or

328
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
acting, causing them to flee or
 

329
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,950
acting, causing them to flee or
otherwise make them unable to function

330
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
otherwise make them unable to function
 

331
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,430
otherwise make them unable to function
as part of the troop for one round or

332
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
as part of the troop for one round or
 

333
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,830
as part of the troop for one round or
more, that segment is removed

334
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:20,840
more, that segment is removed
 

335
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,589
more, that segment is removed
entirely. When this happens, the troops

336
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
entirely. When this happens, the troops
 

337
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,070
entirely. When this happens, the troops
hit points are reduced to its next

338
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
hit points are reduced to its next
 

339
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,670
hit points are reduced to its next
threshold to account for the lost

340
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
threshold to account for the lost
 

341
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,150
threshold to account for the lost
segment. And note that if a single

342
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
segment. And note that if a single
 

343
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,790
segment. And note that if a single
ability has both damaging and

344
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
ability has both damaging and
 

345
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,749
ability has both damaging and
non-damaging effects, apply the damage

346
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
non-damaging effects, apply the damage
 

347
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,510
non-damaging effects, apply the damage
first and then the non-damaging effects.

348
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
first and then the non-damaging effects.
 

349
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,710
first and then the non-damaging effects.
So, for example, say a player casts

350
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
So, for example, say a player casts
 

351
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,350
So, for example, say a player casts
command on the troop. The command spell

352
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
command on the troop. The command spell
 

353
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,589
command on the troop. The command spell
normally only targets one enemy and

354
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
normally only targets one enemy and
 

355
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,469
normally only targets one enemy and
therefore has no effect on the troop,

356
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
therefore has no effect on the troop,
 

357
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,710
therefore has no effect on the troop,
even if the troop was to critically fail

358
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
even if the troop was to critically fail
 

359
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,189
even if the troop was to critically fail
their save. Making one soldier

360
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
their save. Making one soldier
 

361
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,270
their save. Making one soldier
temporarily incapacitated by a spell

362
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
temporarily incapacitated by a spell
 

363
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,510
temporarily incapacitated by a spell
like this will not have a significant

364
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
like this will not have a significant
 

365
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,869
like this will not have a significant
impact on the troop as a whole. But if

366
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
impact on the troop as a whole. But if
 

367
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,710
impact on the troop as a whole. But if
the player heightens that spell to fifth

368
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
the player heightens that spell to fifth
 

369
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,230
the player heightens that spell to fifth
rank, it now targets 10 creatures, which

370
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
rank, it now targets 10 creatures, which
 

371
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,790
rank, it now targets 10 creatures, which
means it has the ability to affect two

372
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,800
means it has the ability to affect two
 

373
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,110
means it has the ability to affect two
segments. Each segment rolls their will

374
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
segments. Each segment rolls their will
 

375
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,990
segments. Each segment rolls their will
saves against the spell independently.

376
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
saves against the spell independently.
 

377
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,230
saves against the spell independently.
We'll say the first segment fails their

378
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
We'll say the first segment fails their
 

379
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,869
We'll say the first segment fails their
will save and the second segment

380
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
will save and the second segment
 

381
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,990
will save and the second segment
critically fails their will save. This

382
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
critically fails their will save. This
 

383
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,150
critically fails their will save. This
causes the troop to shrink by one

384
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,160
causes the troop to shrink by one
 

385
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,589
causes the troop to shrink by one
segment. So why would the troop lose

386
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
segment. So why would the troop lose
 

387
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,509
segment. So why would the troop lose
only one segment here and not two when

388
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
only one segment here and not two when
 

389
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,550
only one segment here and not two when
it failed both of its saves? Because in

390
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
it failed both of its saves? Because in
 

391
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,949
it failed both of its saves? Because in

393
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,829
order for a non-damaging effect to

of troops, they have special rules to
 

413
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,910
of troops, they have special rules to
manage their movement, too. Troops spend

414
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
manage their movement, too. Troops spend
 

415
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,829
manage their movement, too. Troops spend
actions to move like normal creatures

416
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
actions to move like normal creatures
 

417
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,230
actions to move like normal creatures
do. For example, a cityguard squadron

418
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
do. For example, a cityguard squadron
 

419
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,670
do. For example, a cityguard squadron
can spend one action to stride 25 ft.

420
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
can spend one action to stride 25 ft.
 

421
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,310
can spend one action to stride 25 ft.
But when troops move, you select one of

422
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
But when troops move, you select one of
 

423
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,190
But when troops move, you select one of
their segments to be the leading segment

424
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
their segments to be the leading segment
 

425
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,269
their segments to be the leading segment
and move it as you would normally move a

426
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
and move it as you would normally move a
 

427
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,150
and move it as you would normally move a
single largesized creature. And then all

428
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
single largesized creature. And then all
 

429
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,030

finishes its move, the remaining
 

435
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,750
finishes its move, the remaining
segments can be placed in any

action to adjust their formation. When
 

447
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,310

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
performing this, you simply select one
 

449
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,790
performing this, you simply select one
segment that stays in place and then

450

formation you wish as long as it is
 

455
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,630
formation you wish as long as it is
legal. meaning each segment shares an

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
legal. meaning each segment shares an
 

457
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,269
legal. meaning each segment shares an
edge as normal. This is all the official

458
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
edge as normal. This is all the official
 

459
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,670
edge as normal. This is all the official
guidance that's given. So, GS may need

guidance that's given. So, GS may need
 

461
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,350
guidance that's given. So, GS may need
to make their own calls as to what

462
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
to make their own calls as to what
 

463
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,509
to make their own calls as to what
happens when troops try to move through

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
happens when troops try to move through
 

465
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,750
happens when troops try to move through

special rules for how a troop functions
 

473
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,750
special rules for how a troop functions
in combat, but there are a few shared

in combat, but there are a few shared
 

475
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,470
in combat, but there are a few shared
similarities. Troops function like any

similarities. Troops function like any
 

477
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,470

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,590
damage. And each have their own listed
attacks in their stat blocks. Most of

490
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
attacks in their stat blocks. Most of
 

491
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,590
attacks in their stat blocks. Most of
these will be some manner of area attack

492
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
these will be some manner of area attack
 

493
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,750
these will be some manner of area attack
as every member of the troop strikes at

494
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
as every member of the troop strikes at
 

495
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,910
as every member of the troop strikes at
once against any enemies within their

496
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
once against any enemies within their
 

497
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,710
once against any enemies within their
range and therefore most troop attacks

498
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
range and therefore most troop attacks
 

499
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,310
range and therefore most troop attacks
target reflex and not armor class. For

500
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
target reflex and not armor class. For
 

501
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,110
target reflex and not armor class. For
example, city guard squadrons have two

502
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
example, city guard squadrons have two
 

503
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,350
example, city guard squadrons have two
attacks, lower halbirds and shoot

504
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,360
attacks, lower halbirds and shoot
 

505
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,350
attacks, lower halbirds and shoot
crossbows. Lower halbirds cost one to

506
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
crossbows. Lower halbirds cost one to
 

507
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,069
crossbows. Lower halbirds cost one to
three actions, but can only be performed

508
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
three actions, but can only be performed
 

509
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,110
three actions, but can only be performed
once per round. This attack targets all

510
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
once per round. This attack targets all
 

511
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,829
once per round. This attack targets all
enemies within 10 ft of any of the

512
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
enemies within 10 ft of any of the
 

513
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,790
enemies within 10 ft of any of the
troops spaces and deals an amount of

514
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
troops spaces and deals an amount of
 

515
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,949
troops spaces and deals an amount of
damage based on the number of actions

516
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
damage based on the number of actions
 

517
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,750
damage based on the number of actions
spent. Unlike normal single halbird

518
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
spent. Unlike normal single halbird
 

519
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,150
spent. Unlike normal single halbird
attacks, this attack is resisted by a

520
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
attacks, this attack is resisted by a
 

521
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,670
attacks, this attack is resisted by a
reflex saving throw instead of armor

522
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:22,680
reflex saving throw instead of armor
 

523
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,430
reflex saving throw instead of armor
class and shoot crossbows takes two

524
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
class and shoot crossbows takes two
 

525
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,030
class and shoot crossbows takes two
actions and allows the troop to fire

526
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
actions and allows the troop to fire
 

527
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,509
actions and allows the troop to fire
their crossbows into a 10 ft burst area

528
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:30,519
their crossbows into a 10 ft burst area
 

529
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,389
their crossbows into a 10 ft burst area
within 120 ft of them. Unlike regular

530
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
within 120 ft of them. Unlike regular
 

531
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,630
within 120 ft of them. Unlike regular
crossbow attacks, this one is defended

532
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
crossbow attacks, this one is defended
 

533
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,509
crossbow attacks, this one is defended
with reflex instead of armor class. And

534
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
with reflex instead of armor class. And
 

535
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,590
with reflex instead of armor class. And
note that when a troop shrinks in size,

536
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
note that when a troop shrinks in size,
 

537
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,350
note that when a troop shrinks in size,
so does the area for this attack.

538
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
so does the area for this attack.
 

539
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,509
so does the area for this attack.
So, those are the general rules for

540
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
So, those are the general rules for
 

541
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,670
So, those are the general rules for
troops. I will say that there are not a

542
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
troops. I will say that there are not a
 

543
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,590
troops. I will say that there are not a
lot of hard rules for troops. They don't

544
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
lot of hard rules for troops. They don't
 

545
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,069
lot of hard rules for troops. They don't
receive as detailed a write up as one

546
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
receive as detailed a write up as one
 

547
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,310
receive as detailed a write up as one
might expect, and instead, we only have

548
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
might expect, and instead, we only have
 

549
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,389
might expect, and instead, we only have
a couple of glossery entries to guide

550
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
a couple of glossery entries to guide
 

551
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,790
a couple of glossery entries to guide
us. As such, there will likely be

552
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
us. As such, there will likely be
 

553
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,870
us. As such, there will likely be
situations you encounter that there is

554
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
situations you encounter that there is
 

555
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,110
situations you encounter that there is
no hard rule for, and we'll need to

556
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
no hard rule for, and we'll need to
 

557
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,190
no hard rule for, and we'll need to
improvise and make your best ruling as

558
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
improvise and make your best ruling as
 

559
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,509
improvise and make your best ruling as
needed. In general, my advice for these

560
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
needed. In general, my advice for these
 

561
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,430
needed. In general, my advice for these
moments is to keep it as simple as

562
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
moments is to keep it as simple as
 

563
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,190
moments is to keep it as simple as
possible and where mechanics are

564
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
possible and where mechanics are
 

565
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,509
possible and where mechanics are
involved. Treat the troops as one

566
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
involved. Treat the troops as one
 

567
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,310
involved. Treat the troops as one
creature and not focus too heavily on

568
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
creature and not focus too heavily on
 

569
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,629
creature and not focus too heavily on
the narrative presenting the troops as a

570
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
the narrative presenting the troops as a
 

571
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,110
the narrative presenting the troops as a
bunch of individuals. If you have any

572
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
bunch of individuals. If you have any
 

573
