should also note that one action that

you may trigger reactive strikes but

may be important to know exactly when

may be important to know exactly when
 

453
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,710
may be important to know exactly when
the reactive strike occurs for example

454

the reactive strike occurs for example
 

455
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,110
the reactive strike occurs for example
if a successful reactive strike results

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
if a successful reactive strike results

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,350
if a successful reactive strike results
in killing an opponent you may need to

in killing an opponent you may need to
 

459
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,430
in killing an opponent you may need to
know which Square the body occupies if

460
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:10,440
know which Square the body occupies if
 

461
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,509
know which Square the body occupies if
the reactive strike is triggered by an

the reactive strike is triggered by an
 

463
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,910
the reactive strike is triggered by an
enemy moving out of a threatened space

464

enemy moving out of a threatened space
 

465
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,710
enemy moving out of a threatened space
the reactive strike occurs immediately

466
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:17,720
the reactive strike occurs immediately
 

467
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,030
the reactive strike occurs immediately
effectively before they leave that space

468
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
effectively before they leave that space
 

469
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,829
effectively before they leave that space
if it occurred after they leave the

if it occurred after they leave the
 

471
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,750
if it occurred after they leave the
space then they would likely be out of

472
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:24,760
space then they would likely be out of
 

473
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,430
space then they would likely be out of
range of your attack so if an adjacent

range of your attack so if an adjacent

enemy uses the stride action to move out

enemy uses the stride action to move out
 

477
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,550
enemy uses the stride action to move out
of their space you do not wait for that

478
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
of their space you do not wait for that
 

479
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,110
of their space you do not wait for that
action to completely resolve and may

480
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
action to completely resolve and may
 

481
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,910
action to completely resolve and may
attack them immediately but if the

482
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
attack them immediately but if the
 

483
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,870
attack them immediately but if the
reactive strike is triggered by using a

484
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:39,880
reactive strike is triggered by using a
 

485
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,030
reactive strike is triggered by using a
move action without leaving their space

486
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
move action without leaving their space
 

487
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,430
move action without leaving their space
then the enemy gets to fully resolve

488
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
then the enemy gets to fully resolve
 

489
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,870
then the enemy gets to fully resolve
that action before the reactive strike

490
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:47,880
that action before the reactive strike
 

491
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,790
that action before the reactive strike
occurs for example if an enemy stands

492
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
occurs for example if an enemy stands
 

493
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,829
occurs for example if an enemy stands
from prone they completely stand up

494
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
from prone they completely stand up
 

495
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,870
from prone they completely stand up
before resolving your reactive strike

496
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
before resolving your reactive strike

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,030
before resolving your reactive strike
this is important when determining if

this is important when determining if
