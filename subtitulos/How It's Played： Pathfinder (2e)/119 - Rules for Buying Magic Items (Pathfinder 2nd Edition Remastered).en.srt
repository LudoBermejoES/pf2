Hey everybody, Dave here with another
 

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,349
Hey everybody, Dave here with another
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And in

4
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And in
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,190
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And in
this one, I'm just going to address a

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
this one, I'm just going to address a
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,549
this one, I'm just going to address a
couple of similar questions that were

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
couple of similar questions that were
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,030
couple of similar questions that were
posted to video comments in the last

10
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
posted to video comments in the last
 

11
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,230
posted to video comments in the last
week or so. Both of which deal with uh

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
week or so. Both of which deal with uh
 

13
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,710
week or so. Both of which deal with uh
how do you determine if an item is

14
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
how do you determine if an item is
 

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,550
how do you determine if an item is
available for sale in a given community?

16
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
available for sale in a given community?
 

17
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,269
available for sale in a given community?
How do you determine if a player can can

18
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
How do you determine if a player can can
 

19
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,750
How do you determine if a player can can
purchase a certain thing that they want?

20
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
purchase a certain thing that they want?
 

21
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,070
purchase a certain thing that they want?
And um you know, how does this all work?

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
And um you know, how does this all work?
 

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,150
And um you know, how does this all work?
what are the mechanics involved and

24
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
what are the mechanics involved and
 

25
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,350
what are the mechanics involved and
players wishing to purchase some new

26
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
players wishing to purchase some new
 

27
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,389
players wishing to purchase some new
magic items with their hardearned gold.

28
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
magic items with their hardearned gold.
 

29
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,950
magic items with their hardearned gold.
And um I'm just going to say up front

30
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
And um I'm just going to say up front
 

31
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,270
And um I'm just going to say up front
that there's not a whole lot of really

32
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
that there's not a whole lot of really
 

33
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,670
that there's not a whole lot of really
really really

34
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:42,680
really really
 

35
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,350
really really
concrete guidance. A lot of this is left

36
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
concrete guidance. A lot of this is left
 

37
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,630
concrete guidance. A lot of this is left
up to the GM to make decisions and

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
up to the GM to make decisions and
 

39
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,029
up to the GM to make decisions and
interpretations for what makes sense for

40
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
interpretations for what makes sense for
 

41
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,830
interpretations for what makes sense for
for their game and the kind of tone they

42
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
for their game and the kind of tone they
 

43
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,270
for their game and the kind of tone they
want to strike and where in their world

44
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
want to strike and where in their world
 

45
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,150
want to strike and where in their world
uh this particular proposed purchase is

46
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
uh this particular proposed purchase is
 

47
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,549
uh this particular proposed purchase is
going to take place and so on. But there

48
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
going to take place and so on. But there
 

49
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,109
going to take place and so on. But there
is some guidance in the GM core book and

50
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
is some guidance in the GM core book and
 

51
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,670
is some guidance in the GM core book and
uh really comes down to two major

52
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:10,680
uh really comes down to two major
 

53
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,030
uh really comes down to two major
considerations and a handful of minor

54
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
considerations and a handful of minor
 

55
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,070
considerations and a handful of minor
considerations. So the major

56
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
considerations. So the major
 

57
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,749
considerations. So the major
considerations are going to be

58
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
considerations are going to be
 

59
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,429
considerations are going to be
settlement level and rarity. So the

60
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
settlement level and rarity. So the
 

61
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,469
settlement level and rarity. So the
general rule of thumb is if a player

62
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
general rule of thumb is if a player
 

63
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,149
general rule of thumb is if a player
wishes to purchase an item that is of an

64
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
wishes to purchase an item that is of an
 

65
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,230
wishes to purchase an item that is of an
item level equal to or lower than the

66
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
item level equal to or lower than the
 

67
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,830
item level equal to or lower than the
settlement level of the place that

68
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
settlement level of the place that
 

69
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,310
settlement level of the place that
they're wanting to purchase this uh and

70
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
they're wanting to purchase this uh and
 

71
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,030
they're wanting to purchase this uh and
it is common rarity, then there's a

72
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
it is common rarity, then there's a
 

73
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,190
it is common rarity, then there's a
pretty good chance they're going to be

74
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
pretty good chance they're going to be
 

75
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,550
pretty good chance they're going to be
able to source and purchase that item.

76
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
able to source and purchase that item.
 

77
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,710
able to source and purchase that item.
Um, it's not entirely fair to say that

78
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
Um, it's not entirely fair to say that
 

79
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,389
Um, it's not entirely fair to say that
it's a guarantee because there are a

80
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
it's a guarantee because there are a
 

81
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,469
it's a guarantee because there are a
couple of things we'll talk about in uh

82
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
couple of things we'll talk about in uh
 

83
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,870
couple of things we'll talk about in uh
in just a minute, but the the sort of

84
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
in just a minute, but the the sort of
 

85
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,950
in just a minute, but the the sort of
first layer or first criteria you should

86
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
first layer or first criteria you should
 

87
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,830
first layer or first criteria you should
be thinking about is what is the item

88
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
be thinking about is what is the item
 

89
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,990
be thinking about is what is the item
level compared to the settlement level

90
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
level compared to the settlement level
 

91
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,310
level compared to the settlement level
and what is its rarity? If it is of an

92
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
and what is its rarity? If it is of an
 

93
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,389
and what is its rarity? If it is of an
item level equal to or lesser than the

94
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
item level equal to or lesser than the
 

95
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,789
item level equal to or lesser than the
settlement level and it is common

96
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:05,799
settlement level and it is common
 

97
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,990
settlement level and it is common
rarity, good chance they're going to be

98
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
rarity, good chance they're going to be
 

99
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,990
rarity, good chance they're going to be
able to find it somewhere in that

100
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
able to find it somewhere in that
 

101
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,150
able to find it somewhere in that
settlement and purchase it.

102
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
settlement and purchase it.
 

103
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,910
settlement and purchase it.
Now, uh the reason why I say that uh

104
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
Now, uh the reason why I say that uh
 

105
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,990
Now, uh the reason why I say that uh
it's not a guarantee that it's going to

106
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
it's not a guarantee that it's going to
 

107
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,630
it's not a guarantee that it's going to
be available there is because there is

108
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
be available there is because there is
 

109
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,869
be available there is because there is
um a piece of guidance that's provided

110
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
um a piece of guidance that's provided
 

111
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,710
um a piece of guidance that's provided
in GM Core and was previously in the

112
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
in GM Core and was previously in the
 

113
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,949
in GM Core and was previously in the
game mastery guide that I think a lot of

114
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
game mastery guide that I think a lot of
 

115
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,390
game mastery guide that I think a lot of
people overlook and that is that there

116
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
people overlook and that is that there
 

117
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,630
people overlook and that is that there
is a cap placed on the highest level

118
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
is a cap placed on the highest level
 

119
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,110
is a cap placed on the highest level
items, the number of highest level items

120
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
items, the number of highest level items
 

121
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,830
items, the number of highest level items
available in any given settlement.

122
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
available in any given settlement.
 

123
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,790
available in any given settlement.
So, it's not like if you walk into a

124
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
So, it's not like if you walk into a
 

125
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,550
So, it's not like if you walk into a
sixth level city that literally every

126
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
sixth level city that literally every
 

127
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,550
sixth level city that literally every
single common rarity magic item of sixth

128
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
single common rarity magic item of sixth
 

129
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,430
single common rarity magic item of sixth
level or lower is sitting on store

130
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
level or lower is sitting on store
 

131
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,390
level or lower is sitting on store
shelves waiting for you to buy them.

132
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
shelves waiting for you to buy them.
 

133
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,949
shelves waiting for you to buy them.
What it does, what the the guidance is,

134
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
What it does, what the the guidance is,
 

135
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,910
What it does, what the the guidance is,
is that you take a look at the uh the

136
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
is that you take a look at the uh the
 

137
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,270
is that you take a look at the uh the
party treasure table that is on page 59

138
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
party treasure table that is on page 59
 

139
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,390
party treasure table that is on page 59
of GM Core and you take one level lower

140
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
of GM Core and you take one level lower
 

141
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,869
of GM Core and you take one level lower
than the settlement's level and that

142
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
than the settlement's level and that
 

143
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,869
than the settlement's level and that
tells you how many of the highest level

144
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
tells you how many of the highest level
 

145
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,589
tells you how many of the highest level
items are available in that settlement.

146
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
items are available in that settlement.
 

147
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,030
items are available in that settlement.
Uh so if you are in a sixth level city,

148
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
Uh so if you are in a sixth level city,
 

149
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,830
Uh so if you are in a sixth level city,
you look at the the column for permanent

150
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
you look at the the column for permanent
 

151
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,110
you look at the the column for permanent
uh magic items and consumable items and

152
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
uh magic items and consumable items and
 

153
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,550
uh magic items and consumable items and
you look at fifth level cuz that's one

154
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
you look at fifth level cuz that's one
 

155
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,309
you look at fifth level cuz that's one
less than the settlement level and it

156
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
less than the settlement level and it
 

157
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,110
less than the settlement level and it
says uh sixth level two and fifth level

158
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
says uh sixth level two and fifth level
 

159
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,670
says uh sixth level two and fifth level
two for permanent

160
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:38,680
two for permanent
 

161
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,830
two for permanent
items. That means not every sixth level

162
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840

they refer to this

for permanent items. And for
consumables, there's another layer that

206
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
consumables, there's another layer that
 

207
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,510
consumables, there's another layer that
goes down three levels or two levels

at two consumable items of that level as
 

213
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,110
at two consumable items of that level as
well. Uh, so that might make it easier

214
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
well. Uh, so that might make it easier
 

215
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,629
well. Uh, so that might make it easier
than referring to this table all the

than referring to this table all the
 

217
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,629
than referring to this table all the
time. Now, there are some other things

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
time. Now, there are some other things
 

219
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,870
time. Now, there are some other things
to consider. Uh, what if the item that

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
to consider. Uh, what if the item that
 

221
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,950
to consider. Uh, what if the item that
you're wanting to find is not common

222
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:57,960
you're wanting to find is not common
 

223
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,469
you're wanting to find is not common
rarity? Uh, the book doesn't

224
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:01,479
rarity? Uh, the book doesn't
 

225
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,150
rarity? Uh, the book doesn't
provide hard

226
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
provide hard
 

227
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,469
provide hard
uh hard mechanics for finding items that

uh hard mechanics for finding items that
 

229
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,629
uh hard mechanics for finding items that
are not common. Uh, again, this is going

00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
are not common. Uh, again, this is going
 

231
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,390
are not common. Uh, again, this is going
to be up to the GM, but the guidance

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
to be up to the GM, but the guidance
 

233
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,950
to be up to the GM, but the guidance
that they that they do give you is that

that they that they do give you is that
 

235
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,430
that they that they do give you is that
common rarity items are typically gated

236
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
common rarity items are typically gated
 

237
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,310
common rarity items are typically gated
behind something. They might be gated

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
behind something. They might be gated
 

239
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,830

behind uh a certain ancestry that is
 

241
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,230
behind uh a certain ancestry that is
fond of making these items. They could

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
fond of making these items. They could
 

243
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,070

people who are um expert level lore in a
 

253
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,749
people who are um expert level lore in a
particular magical tradition would even

particular magical tradition would even
 

255
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,310
particular magical tradition would even
know that such a thing exists and uh

256
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,320
know that such a thing exists and uh
 

257
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,029
know that such a thing exists and uh
would would have a an ability to to find

258
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
would would have a an ability to to find
 

259
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,590
would would have a an ability to to find

00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
and source uh those particular items.
 

261
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,590
and source uh those particular items.
But when you think about the um the

262
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
But when you think about the um the
 

263
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,749
But when you think about the um the
access requirements to these uncommon

264
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
access requirements to these uncommon
 

265
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,550
access requirements to these uncommon
items is is might be a good guideline to

266
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
items is is might be a good guideline to
 

267
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,430
items is is might be a good guideline to
not just think about um does the

268
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
not just think about um does the
 

269
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,909
not just think about um does the
player's character meet an access

270
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:12,919
player's character meet an access
 

271
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,550
player's character meet an access
requirement or does the settlement

272
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:15,560
requirement or does the settlement
 

273
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,790
requirement or does the settlement
itself meet that requirement. So, um, if

274
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
itself meet that requirement. So, um, if
 

275
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,430
itself meet that requirement. So, um, if
you have an elven character and they are

276
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
you have an elven character and they are

286
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
human settlement, this might be
 

287
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,430
human settlement, this might be
considered or probably would be

288
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
considered or probably would be
 

289
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,870
considered or probably would be
considered an uncommon item, but they

290
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
considered an uncommon item, but they
 

291
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,950
considered an uncommon item, but they
might be able to uh to rely on their

292
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:45,960
might be able to uh to rely on their
 

293
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,629
might be able to uh to rely on their
familiarity to start conversation ations

294

familiarity to start conversation ations
 

295
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,469
familiarity to start conversation ations
to find uh an an elven bartender who was

296
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
to find uh an an elven bartender who was
 

297
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,270
to find uh an an elven bartender who was
a retired adventurer and talk to them

298
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
a retired adventurer and talk to them
 

299
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,629
a retired adventurer and talk to them
and say, "Hey, can I buy that blade off

300
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
and say, "Hey, can I buy that blade off
 

301
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,189
and say, "Hey, can I buy that blade off
you?" Something like that. Um it's just

302
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
you?" Something like that. Um it's just
 

303
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,909
you?" Something like that. Um it's just
not going to be uncommon items are just

304
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
not going to be uncommon items are just
 

305
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,270
not going to be uncommon items are just
not going to be freely available

306
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
not going to be freely available
 

307
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,749
not going to be freely available
typically to everybody in the settlement

308
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
typically to everybody in the settlement
 

309
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,790
typically to everybody in the settlement
unless the settlement itself meets the

310
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
unless the settlement itself meets the
 

311
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,830
unless the settlement itself meets the
criteria for the access. So, if this was

312
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
criteria for the access. So, if this was
 

313
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,990
criteria for the access. So, if this was
an an predominantly elven community, uh,

314
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
an an predominantly elven community, uh,
 

315
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,070
an an predominantly elven community, uh,
then elven curve blades are probably

316
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
then elven curve blades are probably
 

317
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,629
then elven curve blades are probably
available at every blacksmith. So, when

318
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
available at every blacksmith. So, when
 

319
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,749
available at every blacksmith. So, when
you think about these access

320
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
you think about these access
 

321
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,270
you think about these access
requirements, um, or access guidelines

322
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
requirements, um, or access guidelines
 

323
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,749
requirements, um, or access guidelines
for uncommon items, be sure to look at

324
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759

the book talks about these

And it's up to you as the GM to apply

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
And it's up to you as the GM to apply
 

471
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,190
And it's up to you as the GM to apply
modifications to what's available there

472
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
modifications to what's available there

00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
according to like what's their trade,
 

475
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,949
according to like what's their trade,
what are their major imports and

476
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
what are their major imports and
 

477
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,829
what are their major imports and
exports, where are they located, things

478
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
exports, where are they located, things
 

479
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,350

of that nature. So, as a GM, you very

480
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
of that nature. So, as a GM, you very
 

481
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,590
of that nature. So, as a GM, you very
much should be willing to bend some of

482
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
much should be willing to bend some of
 

483
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,190
much should be willing to bend some of
these rules a little bit uh in favor of

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
these rules a little bit uh in favor of
 

485
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,949
these rules a little bit uh in favor of
what you envision would make sense for

486
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
what you envision would make sense for
 

487
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,750
what you envision would make sense for
each of those communities.

488
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
each of those communities.
 

489
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,389
each of those communities.
As far as official guidance that I've

490
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
As far as official guidance that I've
 

491
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,590
As far as official guidance that I've
seen in the book, that pretty much

492
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
seen in the book, that pretty much
 

493
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,829
seen in the book, that pretty much
covers all the official guidance, but

494
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
covers all the official guidance, but
 

495
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,310
covers all the official guidance, but
there's probably a few other linkering

496
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,320
there's probably a few other linkering
 

497
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,470
there's probably a few other linkering
questions that uh might be worthwhile

498
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
questions that uh might be worthwhile
 

499
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,949
questions that uh might be worthwhile
just taking a look at. Just keep in mind

500
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
just taking a look at. Just keep in mind
 

501
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,150
just taking a look at. Just keep in mind
from here on out, we're not talking

502
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
from here on out, we're not talking
 

503
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,710
from here on out, we're not talking
about official game rules or official

504
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
about official game rules or official
 

505
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,829
about official game rules or official
guidance to the rules. This is mostly uh

506
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
guidance to the rules. This is mostly uh
 

507
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,590
guidance to the rules. This is mostly uh
my opinion, my take, and perhaps some

508
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
my opinion, my take, and perhaps some
 

509
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,670
my opinion, my take, and perhaps some
things I've seen discussed online as

510
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
things I've seen discussed online as
 

511
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,670
things I've seen discussed online as
well that's worked for for other people.

512
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
well that's worked for for other people.
 

513
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,670
well that's worked for for other people.
So, the number one question after

514
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
So, the number one question after
 

515
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,870
So, the number one question after
hearing that you're capped at only two

516
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
hearing that you're capped at only two
 

517
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,829
hearing that you're capped at only two
magic items of the settlement level and

518
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
magic items of the settlement level and
 

519
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,150
magic items of the settlement level and
two magic items of the settlement level

520
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
two magic items of the settlement level
 

521
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,230
two magic items of the settlement level
minus one is how do you determine what

522
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
minus one is how do you determine what
 

523
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,590
minus one is how do you determine what
those items

524
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,600
those items
 

525
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,670
those items
are? So, uh again, no official guidance

526
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
are? So, uh again, no official guidance
 

527
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,269
are? So, uh again, no official guidance
for this. Uh but could just be the GM

528
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
for this. Uh but could just be the GM
 

529
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,870
for this. Uh but could just be the GM
could, you know, GM could just say, you

530
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
could, you know, GM could just say, you
 

531
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,790
could, you know, GM could just say, you
know what, I think this item and this

532
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
know what, I think this item and this
 

533
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,389
know what, I think this item and this
item makes sense. that's what they're

534
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
item makes sense. that's what they're
 

535
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,949
item makes sense. that's what they're
going to be. It could be items that are

536
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
going to be. It could be items that are
 

537
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,990
going to be. It could be items that are
thematically tied to the settlement. Uh,

538
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
thematically tied to the settlement. Uh,
 

539
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,910
thematically tied to the settlement. Uh,
this is a traditionally dwarven

540
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
this is a traditionally dwarven
 

541
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,750
this is a traditionally dwarven
settlement. So, I'm going to make sure

542
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
settlement. So, I'm going to make sure
 

543
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,790
settlement. So, I'm going to make sure
that uh that the the two settlement

544
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
that uh that the the two settlement
 

545
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,069
that uh that the the two settlement
level equal items are items that have

546
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
level equal items are items that have
 

547
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,910
level equal items are items that have
the dwarven trait cuz they're more

548
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
the dwarven trait cuz they're more
 

549
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,949
the dwarven trait cuz they're more
likely to be there. Uh, you can also

550
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
likely to be there. Uh, you can also
 

551
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,389
likely to be there. Uh, you can also
just, you know, make it easy. Uh, these

552
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
just, you know, make it easy. Uh, these
 

553
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,949
just, you know, make it easy. Uh, these
are often very transactional moments.

554
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
are often very transactional moments.
 

555
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,069
are often very transactional moments.
And like I said, as long as it's not

556
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
And like I said, as long as it's not
 

557
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,990
And like I said, as long as it's not
like a rare item, it probably isn't

558
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
like a rare item, it probably isn't
 

559
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,069
like a rare item, it probably isn't
something that's that's that's really

560
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
something that's that's that's really
 

561
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,790
something that's that's that's really
tightly integrated into the story. This

562
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
tightly integrated into the story. This
 

563
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,110
tightly integrated into the story. This
is is just so so transactional. Just

564
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
is is just so so transactional. Just
 

565
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,230
is is just so so transactional. Just
have the players decide. You It could be

566
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
have the players decide. You It could be
 

567
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,069
have the players decide. You It could be
the first two items that the players ask

568
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
the first two items that the players ask
 

569
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,350
the first two items that the players ask
for, those just happen to be the items.

570
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
for, those just happen to be the items.
 

571
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,230
for, those just happen to be the items.
Or it could be have your players make

572
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
Or it could be have your players make
 

573
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,389
Or it could be have your players make
their wish list. And then when they have

574
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
their wish list. And then when they have
 

575
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,829
their wish list. And then when they have
their wish list, you look at it and you

576
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
their wish list, you look at it and you
 

577
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,550
their wish list, you look at it and you
say, "Okay, you you've selected four

578
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
say, "Okay, you you've selected four
 

579
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,790
say, "Okay, you you've selected four
sixlevel items and this is a sixle

580
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
sixlevel items and this is a sixle
 

581
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,069
sixlevel items and this is a sixle
settlement. They're only going to have

582
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
settlement. They're only going to have
 

583
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,509
settlement. They're only going to have
two of these. Now, which of these two do

584
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
two of these. Now, which of these two do
 

585
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,509
two of these. Now, which of these two do
you want?" Uh, and and put it into their

586
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
you want?" Uh, and and put it into their
 

587
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,750
you want?" Uh, and and put it into their
hands. Now, I agree not entirely

588
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
hands. Now, I agree not entirely
 

589
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,550
hands. Now, I agree not entirely
realistic and may great a little bit on

590
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
realistic and may great a little bit on
 

591
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,470
realistic and may great a little bit on
immersions just to say, "Hey, whatever,

592
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
immersions just to say, "Hey, whatever,
 

593
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,910
immersions just to say, "Hey, whatever,
you know, the two items that you wanted,

594
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
you know, the two items that you wanted,
 

595
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,230
you know, the two items that you wanted,
they happen to be here." But again, I

596
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
they happen to be here." But again, I
 

597
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,910
they happen to be here." But again, I
personally in my games find these

598
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
personally in my games find these
 

599
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,430
personally in my games find these
moments to be very transactional in

600
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
moments to be very transactional in
 

601
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,350
moments to be very transactional in
nature. I think the number one um

602
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
nature. I think the number one um
 

603
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,430
nature. I think the number one um
barrier to to prevent players from, you

604
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
barrier to to prevent players from, you
 

605
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,269
barrier to to prevent players from, you
know, just getting whatever they want

606
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
know, just getting whatever they want
 

607
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,949
know, just getting whatever they want
whenever they want is the cost of the

608
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
whenever they want is the cost of the
 

609
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,590
whenever they want is the cost of the
items. And frankly, a lot of times they

610
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
items. And frankly, a lot of times they
 

611
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,470
items. And frankly, a lot of times they
can't afford whatever would be an equal

612
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
can't afford whatever would be an equal
 

613
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,790
can't afford whatever would be an equal
level of that settlement unless they're

614
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
level of that settlement unless they're
 

615
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,470
level of that settlement unless they're
higher level characters visiting a lower

616
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
higher level characters visiting a lower
 

617
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,829
higher level characters visiting a lower
level settlement. Um, so if it's common

618
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
level settlement. Um, so if it's common
 

619
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,750
level settlement. Um, so if it's common
already, I I'm I'm usually cool with

620
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
already, I I'm I'm usually cool with
 

621
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,310
already, I I'm I'm usually cool with
just letting them buy whatever and not

622
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
just letting them buy whatever and not
 

623
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,069
just letting them buy whatever and not
worry about the caps as long as they got

624
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
worry about the caps as long as they got
 

625
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,190
worry about the caps as long as they got
the money for it. But um, again, those

626
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,200
the money for it. But um, again, those
 

627
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,870
the money for it. But um, again, those
caps are the official

628
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:57,880
caps are the official
 

629
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,990
caps are the official
guidance. Another thing that you could

630
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
guidance. Another thing that you could
 

631
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,430
guidance. Another thing that you could
do to determine what those uh those

632
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
do to determine what those uh those
 

633
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,430
do to determine what those uh those
limited items are in a community is to

634
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
limited items are in a community is to
 

635
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,069
limited items are in a community is to
use some kind of random loot generator.

636
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
use some kind of random loot generator.
 

637
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,069
use some kind of random loot generator.
Uh, there's several online. I I do not

638
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
Uh, there's several online. I I do not
 

639
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,949
Uh, there's several online. I I do not
know them well enough to really endorse

640
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
know them well enough to really endorse
 

641
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,389
know them well enough to really endorse
any of them and say that I use them

642
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
any of them and say that I use them
 

643
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,790

you'll you'll you'll
find. So, another question that might

662
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
find. So, another question that might
 

663
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,150
find. So, another question that might
come up that's not addressing the rules

664
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,160
come up that's not addressing the rules
 

665
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,990
come up that's not addressing the rules
is when do the the these two limited

666
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,000
is when do the the these two limited
 

667
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,470
is when do the the these two limited
items per level of the Sodomus level and

669
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,269
items per level of the Sodomus level and
the level beneath it, when do those get

670
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:48,279
the level beneath it, when do those get
 

671
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,790
the level beneath it, when do those get
refreshed? So, my players go in and they

672
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
refreshed? So, my players go in and they
 

673
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,629
refreshed? So, my players go in and they
they they buy all four of those limited

674
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
they they buy all four of those limited
 

675
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,350
they they buy all four of those limited
items in a settlement. When can they

676
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
items in a settlement. When can they
 

677
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,990

store shelves refilled, so to speak, and
buy more? Uh, no guidance to that. Uh I

682
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
buy more? Uh, no guidance to that. Uh I
 

683
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,310
buy more? Uh, no guidance to that. Uh I
think uh easy recommendations would be

684
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
think uh easy recommendations would be
 

685
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,990
think uh easy recommendations would be
after a major story milestone, they

686
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
after a major story milestone, they
 

687
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,189
after a major story milestone, they
would have uh more items available for

688
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
would have uh more items available for
 

689
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,790
would have uh more items available for
sale within the settlement uh or after a

690
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
sale within the settlement uh or after a
 

691
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,550
sale within the settlement uh or after a
significant amount of downtime the next

692
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
significant amount of downtime the next
 

693
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,949
significant amount of downtime the next
time the players have a week of

694
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:21,959
time the players have a week of
 

695
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,470
time the players have a week of
downtime, then that might be an

696
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
downtime, then that might be an
 

697
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,430
downtime, then that might be an
opportunity to sort of refresh what is

698
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
opportunity to sort of refresh what is
 

699
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,350

And
 

789
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,750
And
so there there certainly is an an area

790
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
so there there certainly is an an area
 

791
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,350
so there there certainly is an an area
within the narrative where you would go

792
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
within the narrative where you would go
 

793
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,590
within the narrative where you would go
to so-called magic shops. And there's

794
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
to so-called magic shops. And there's
 

795
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,750
to so-called magic shops. And there's
other settings where either because of

796
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
other settings where either because of
 

797
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,590
other settings where either because of
the size of the settlement or because of

798
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
the size of the settlement or because of
 

799
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,750
the size of the settlement or because of
the culture or nationality wouldn't do

800
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
the culture or nationality wouldn't do
 

801
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,830
the culture or nationality wouldn't do
that.

802
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:40,840
that.
 

803
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,310
that.
Um, it's also worth to keep in mind that

804
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
Um, it's also worth to keep in mind that
 

805
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,230
Um, it's also worth to keep in mind that
when they talk about what's available,

806
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
when they talk about what's available,
 

807
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,669
when they talk about what's available,
they're talking about what's available

808
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
they're talking about what's available
 

809
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,190
they're talking about what's available
across the entire settlement, not what's

810
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
across the entire settlement, not what's
 

811
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,710
across the entire settlement, not what's
available at any one given store. So,

812
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
available at any one given store. So,
 

813
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,029
available at any one given store. So,
it's not like you walk into one store

814
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
it's not like you walk into one store
 

815
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,230
it's not like you walk into one store
and they've got every common rarity

816
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
and they've got every common rarity
 

817
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,070
and they've got every common rarity
magic item of level one to level four

818
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
magic item of level one to level four
 

819
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,750
magic item of level one to level four
and then two level fives and two level

820
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
and then two level fives and two level
 

821
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,510
and then two level fives and two level
sixes. It's in that entire city. those

822
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
sixes. It's in that entire city. those
 

823
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,470
sixes. It's in that entire city. those
items can be found spread out wherever

824
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
items can be found spread out wherever
 

825
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,110
items can be found spread out wherever
makes the most logical

826
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,120
makes the most logical
 

827
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,390
makes the most logical
sense. Now, for me, in my games, for

828
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
sense. Now, for me, in my games, for
 

829
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,270
sense. Now, for me, in my games, for
whatever it's worth, I tend to use

830
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,280
whatever it's worth, I tend to use
 

831
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,110
whatever it's worth, I tend to use

you sell player sell at 50%. Um and
 

847
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,510
you sell player sell at 50%. Um and
there's also a general cap that you

848
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
there's also a general cap that you
 

849
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,350
there's also a general cap that you
shouldn't be selling items of a higher

850
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
shouldn't be selling items of a higher
 

851
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,870
shouldn't be selling items of a higher
settlement level than the settlements

852
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
settlement level than the settlements
 

853
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,710
settlement level than the settlements
level because there's not people in that

854
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
level because there's not people in that
 

855
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,950
level because there's not people in that
settlement who you know a seventh level

856
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
settlement who you know a seventh level
 

857
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,669
settlement who you know a seventh level
settlement doesn't have the funds to buy

858
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
settlement doesn't have the funds to buy
 

859
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,750
settlement doesn't have the funds to buy
15th level magical items from players.

860
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
15th level magical items from players.
 

861
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,669
15th level magical items from players.
But anyway,

862
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
But anyway,
 

863
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,510
But anyway,
um I use churches. Uh I I think Abbidar

864
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
um I use churches. Uh I I think Abbidar
 

865
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,830
um I use churches. Uh I I think Abbidar
is always interested in trade and making

866
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
is always interested in trade and making
 

867
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,430
is always interested in trade and making
money and also they've got, you know,

868
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
money and also they've got, you know,
 

869
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,830
money and also they've got, you know,
especially in their cities, they got

870
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:08,840
especially in their cities, they got
 

871
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,190
especially in their cities, they got
vaults. So you would think things that

872
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
vaults. So you would think things that
 

873
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,029
vaults. So you would think things that
are as valuable as magical items aren't

874
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
are as valuable as magical items aren't
 

875
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,270
are as valuable as magical items aren't
just sitting on store shelves anyway.

876
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
just sitting on store shelves anyway.
 

877
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,150
just sitting on store shelves anyway.
They're in a vault somewhere. And Nethos

878
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
They're in a vault somewhere. And Nethos
 

879
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,150
They're in a vault somewhere. And Nethos
has an interest in magic. Um, so I use

880
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
has an interest in magic. Um, so I use
 

881
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,110
has an interest in magic. Um, so I use
churches often to to manage the uh the

882
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
churches often to to manage the uh the
 

883
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,029
churches often to to manage the uh the
buying and selling a trade of magical

884
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
buying and selling a trade of magical
 

885
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,990
buying and selling a trade of magical
items. Again, that's just me what I do

886
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,000
items. Again, that's just me what I do
 

887
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,510
items. Again, that's just me what I do
with my games. There's nothing official

888
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
with my games. There's nothing official
 

889
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,190
with my games. There's nothing official
in the um in the rules about that. Um,

890
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
in the um in the rules about that. Um,
 

891
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,710
in the um in the rules about that. Um,
another question, I guess I kind of

892
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
another question, I guess I kind of
 

893
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,150
another question, I guess I kind of
touched on this a little bit already,

894
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
touched on this a little bit already,
 

895
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,590
touched on this a little bit already,
which was, are there any mechanics

896
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
which was, are there any mechanics
 

897
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,310
which was, are there any mechanics
involved in in finding a seller? So, if

898
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
involved in in finding a seller? So, if
 

899
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,830
involved in in finding a seller? So, if
you want to purchase that uncommon

900
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
you want to purchase that uncommon
 

901
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,870
you want to purchase that uncommon
rarity item or you want to try to source

902
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
rarity item or you want to try to source
 

903
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,510
rarity item or you want to try to source
something that is one level higher than

904
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
something that is one level higher than
 

905
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,430
something that is one level higher than
the settlements level and you're a

906
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
the settlements level and you're a
 

907
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,150
the settlements level and you're a
higher level character, um, what are the

908
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
higher level character, um, what are the
 

909
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,870
higher level character, um, what are the
rules to do that? There's really not a

910
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
rules to do that? There's really not a
 

911
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,710
rules to do that? There's really not a
lot of hard rules to do this. Um, it's

912
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
lot of hard rules to do this. Um, it's
 

913
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,549
lot of hard rules to do this. Um, it's
going to be up to the GM to decide, you

914
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
going to be up to the GM to decide, you
 

915
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,909
going to be up to the GM to decide, you
know, how crunchy and how mechanical

916
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
know, how crunchy and how mechanical
 

917
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,029
know, how crunchy and how mechanical
they want to get. Uh, gather

918
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
they want to get. Uh, gather
 

919
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,350
they want to get. Uh, gather
information. Skill checks could be used.

920
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
information. Skill checks could be used.
 

921
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,270
information. Skill checks could be used.
lower skill checks could be used, modify

922
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
lower skill checks could be used, modify
 

923
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,909
lower skill checks could be used, modify
those according to

924
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:16,919
those according to
 

925
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,669
those according to
rarity. But if you do that, I would

926
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
rarity. But if you do that, I would
 

927
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,789
rarity. But if you do that, I would
advise that you you as the GM need to

928
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
advise that you you as the GM need to
 

929
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,270
advise that you you as the GM need to
decide, is this something that actually

930
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
decide, is this something that actually
 

931
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,789
decide, is this something that actually
exists in this settlement? And if they

932
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
exists in this settlement? And if they
 

933
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,950
exists in this settlement? And if they
pass the skill checks, then they're able

934
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
pass the skill checks, then they're able
 

935
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,950
pass the skill checks, then they're able
to track down the person who has that

936
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
to track down the person who has that
 

937
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,909
to track down the person who has that
item. um and not turn this into if you

Uh I know it can be a downer to pass a
 

947

best efforts, you're not able to source
that here. Uh but you don't want to get

that here. Uh but you don't want to get
 

953
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,669
that here. Uh but you don't want to get
into a situation where a player that has

954
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
into a situation where a player that has
 

955
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,669
into a situation where a player that has
really high skill bonus and or really

good luck with the dice is able to

good luck with the dice is able to
 

959
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,909
good luck with the dice is able to
source just like anything. I would view

960
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:01,919
source just like anything. I would view
