00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,590
hey everybody Dave here with another
Pathfinder rule reminder for you and

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:04,600
Pathfinder rule reminder for you and
 

5
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,190
Pathfinder rule reminder for you and
today's question is about players

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
today's question is about players
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,270
today's question is about players
writing upon other players with the

8
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,280
writing upon other players with the
 

9
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,509
writing upon other players with the
release of how of the wild we now have

10
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
release of how of the wild we now have
 

11
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,510
release of how of the wild we now have
large size ancestries that players can

12
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:16,520
large size ancestries that players can
 

13
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,750
large size ancestries that players can
play so this specific scenario involves

14
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
play so this specific scenario involves
 

15
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,230
play so this specific scenario involves
what if we have two players one of them

16
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,240
what if we have two players one of them
 

17
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,429
what if we have two players one of them
is a human that's mediumsized and the

18
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
is a human that's mediumsized and the
 

19
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,470
is a human that's mediumsized and the
other is a minur which is large size

20
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
other is a minur which is large size
 

21
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,589
other is a minur which is large size
what are the rules for the human player

22
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:28,599
what are the rules for the human player
 

23
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,790
what are the rules for the human player
to ride upon their large siiz minur

24
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:31,800
to ride upon their large siiz minur
 

25
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,830
to ride upon their large siiz minur
friend into

26
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
friend into
 

27
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,030
friend into
combat and so let's take a look at these

28
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,040
combat and so let's take a look at these
 

29
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,950
combat and so let's take a look at these
rules the rules are provided in Hall of

30
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:37,960
rules the rules are provided in Hall of
 

31
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,750
rules the rules are provided in Hall of
the wild the same book that gives us the

32
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
the wild the same book that gives us the
 

33
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,389
the wild the same book that gives us the
new large size ancestries and it's on

34
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
new large size ancestries and it's on
 

35
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,270
new large size ancestries and it's on
page nine and the first thing that uh

36
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,280
page nine and the first thing that uh
 

37
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,750
page nine and the first thing that uh
this rule says is a PC can write on

38
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:48,760
this rule says is a PC can write on
 

39
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,310
this rule says is a PC can write on
another PC as long as the second PC is

40
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,320
another PC as long as the second PC is
 

41
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,709
another PC as long as the second PC is
at least two size categories larger than

42
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
at least two size categories larger than
 

43
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,830
at least two size categories larger than
them so this is a little different than

44
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
them so this is a little different than
 

45
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,069
them so this is a little different than
the rules we've seen before and and

46
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
the rules we've seen before and and
 

47
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,310
the rules we've seen before and and
before Hall of the wild when you looked

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
before Hall of the wild when you looked
 

49
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,750
before Hall of the wild when you looked
at any information uh for example the

50
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,760
at any information uh for example the
 

51
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,550
at any information uh for example the
mount action uh it would specifically

52
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,560
mount action uh it would specifically
 

53
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,590
mount action uh it would specifically
say that you used it to get upon a

54
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:10,600
say that you used it to get upon a
 

55
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,910
say that you used it to get upon a
creature that was one size category

56
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:12,920
creature that was one size category
 

57
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,350
creature that was one size category
larger than you so that right there is

58
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:16,360
larger than you so that right there is
 

59
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,109
larger than you so that right there is
going to invalidate the scenario of a

60
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
going to invalidate the scenario of a
 

61
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,710
going to invalidate the scenario of a
medium-size human riding on a large siiz

62
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:21,720
medium-size human riding on a large siiz
 

63
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,109
medium-size human riding on a large siiz
Minotaur because that's only a on siiz

64
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
Minotaur because that's only a on siiz
 

65
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,469
Minotaur because that's only a on siiz
category difference uh instead what we

66
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:27,479
category difference uh instead what we
 

67
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,990
category difference uh instead what we
would have to have is a small size

68
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
would have to have is a small size
 

69
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,710
would have to have is a small size
character wanting to ride upon the minur

70
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
character wanting to ride upon the minur
 

71
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,310
character wanting to ride upon the minur
so uh that would be a halfling for

72
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,320
so uh that would be a halfling for
 

73
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,310
so uh that would be a halfling for
example or a goblin anything the small

74
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,320
example or a goblin anything the small
 

75
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,389
example or a goblin anything the small
size leesy whatever writing upon the um

76
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:41,399
size leesy whatever writing upon the um
 

77
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,789
size leesy whatever writing upon the um
the minur uh I actually think the the

78
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:43,799
the minur uh I actually think the the
 

79
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,590
the minur uh I actually think the the
the new moon uh Heritage uh seren are

80
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,600
the new moon uh Heritage uh seren are
 

81
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,670
the new moon uh Heritage uh seren are
like Smalls siiz minotaurs so you could

82
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
like Smalls siiz minotaurs so you could
 

83
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,270
like Smalls siiz minotaurs so you could
even have some bizarre situation of a

84
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,280
even have some bizarre situation of a
 

85
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,350
even have some bizarre situation of a
small-sized minur riding upon a large

86
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,360
small-sized minur riding upon a large
 

87
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,230
small-sized minur riding upon a large
siiz minur shoulder players don't get up

88
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,240
siiz minur shoulder players don't get up
 

89
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,630
siiz minur shoulder players don't get up
to Wacky stuff with uh with with these

90
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:01,640
to Wacky stuff with uh with with these
 

91
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,389
to Wacky stuff with uh with with these
rules and that's one possibility but uh

92
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:05,399
rules and that's one possibility but uh
 

93
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,949
rules and that's one possibility but uh
anyway uh I think the reason that the

94
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:07,959
anyway uh I think the reason that the
 

95
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,350
anyway uh I think the reason that the
previous uh rules always refer to two-

96
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,360
previous uh rules always refer to two-
 

97
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,150
previous uh rules always refer to two-
size categories larger is because they

98
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
size categories larger is because they
 

99
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,470
size categories larger is because they
were specifically talking about

100
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,480
were specifically talking about
 

101
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,070
were specifically talking about
creatures that were intended to be

102
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,080
creatures that were intended to be
 

103
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,390
creatures that were intended to be
mounts these are typically long

104
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,400
mounts these are typically long
 

105
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,589
mounts these are typically long
creatures instead of tall creatures and

106
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
creatures instead of tall creatures and
 

107
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,309
creatures instead of tall creatures and
typically quadrupeds so even though the

108
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
typically quadrupeds so even though the
 

109
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,030
typically quadrupeds so even though the
roles didn't you know specify that you

110
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
roles didn't you know specify that you
 

111
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,030
roles didn't you know specify that you
had to be long instead of tall and you

112
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
had to be long instead of tall and you
 

113
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,350
had to be long instead of tall and you
had to have four limbs to walking Pond

114
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
had to have four limbs to walking Pond
 

115
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,270
had to have four limbs to walking Pond
instead of two

116
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
instead of two
 

117
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,670
instead of two
uh that was what the Assumption was so

118
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
uh that was what the Assumption was so
 

119
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,190
uh that was what the Assumption was so
we're talking horses or riding

120
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
we're talking horses or riding
 

121
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,070
we're talking horses or riding
dogs uh you Wars for goblins stuff like

122
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,080
dogs uh you Wars for goblins stuff like
 

123
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,030
dogs uh you Wars for goblins stuff like
that but now that is actually PCS who

124
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,040
that but now that is actually PCS who
 

125
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,910
that but now that is actually PCS who
are typically going to be by pedal we

126
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
are typically going to be by pedal we
 

127
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,030
are typically going to be by pedal we
have a new set of rules so that's the

128
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,040
have a new set of rules so that's the
 

129
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,589
have a new set of rules so that's the
first part uh you have to be two size

130
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:50,599
first part uh you have to be two size
 

131
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,630
first part uh you have to be two size
categories larger for that to serve as

132
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
categories larger for that to serve as
 

133
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,630
categories larger for that to serve as
um a creature to be ridden upon here it

134
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
um a creature to be ridden upon here it
 

135
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,990
um a creature to be ridden upon here it
also says this requires a tremendous

136
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,000
also says this requires a tremendous
 

137
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,390
also says this requires a tremendous
amount of coordination to ensure the

138
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
amount of coordination to ensure the
 

139
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,110
amount of coordination to ensure the
smaller PC doesn't get in the way or the

140
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
smaller PC doesn't get in the way or the
 

141
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,470
smaller PC doesn't get in the way or the
two PCS don't jostle each other into

142
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:07,480
two PCS don't jostle each other into
 

143
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,390
two PCS don't jostle each other into
losing actions as a result for most

144
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
losing actions as a result for most
 

145
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,910
losing actions as a result for most
parties this tactic is less favorable

146
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:12,920
parties this tactic is less favorable
 

147
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,670
parties this tactic is less favorable
than the smaller PC just using their

148
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680
than the smaller PC just using their
 

149
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,990
than the smaller PC just using their
amount and yeah and as I go through this

150
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,000
amount and yeah and as I go through this
 

151
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,229
amount and yeah and as I go through this
it's I think it's going become more and

152
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
it's I think it's going become more and
 

153
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,509
it's I think it's going become more and
more clear that um there's not a lot of

154
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:22,519
more clear that um there's not a lot of
 

155
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,350
more clear that um there's not a lot of
mechanical benefit to uh to having one

156
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,360
mechanical benefit to uh to having one
 

157
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,110
mechanical benefit to uh to having one
PC ride upon another uh especially in

158
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,120
PC ride upon another uh especially in
 

159
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,550
PC ride upon another uh especially in
combat so why would they do this answer

160
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
combat so why would they do this answer
 

161
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,869
combat so why would they do this answer
is simple because it's fun because it's

00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
is simple because it's fun because it's

off the bat the most the most clear

downside to this is you're now occupa

184
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:04,599
downside to this is you're now occupa

which means uh if someone wants to hit

188
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:08,439
which means uh if someone wants to hit

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,390
which means uh if someone wants to hit
you with an AOE they only have to hit

ridden to go next or in the next round

324
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
ridden to go next or in the next round
 

325
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,629
ridden to go next or in the next round
they could swap that order and go the

326
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
they could swap that order and go the
 

327
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,230
they could swap that order and go the
other way so let's talk about those

328
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
other way so let's talk about those
 

329
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,749
other way so let's talk about those
special situations like the centur so

330
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
special situations like the centur so
 

331
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,749
special situations like the centur so
centur if we look at their ancestry they

332
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:20,759
centur if we look at their ancestry they
 

333
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,150
centur if we look at their ancestry they
have a special feature called Mount and

334
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
have a special feature called Mount and
 

335
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,790
have a special feature called Mount and
it says your ecoin body is well suited

336
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
it says your ecoin body is well suited
 

337
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,029
it says your ecoin body is well suited
for caring trusted allies a piece PC can

338
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:30,039
for caring trusted allies a piece PC can
 

339
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,589
for caring trusted allies a piece PC can
ride you if they are one size category

340
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:32,599
ride you if they are one size category
 

341
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,869
ride you if they are one size category
smaller than you rather than needing to

342
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:34,879
smaller than you rather than needing to
 

343
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,390
smaller than you rather than needing to
be two size category smaller so if the

344
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
be two size category smaller so if the
 

345
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,469
be two size category smaller so if the
PC that is being written upon is like a

346
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:41,479
PC that is being written upon is like a
 

347
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,710
PC that is being written upon is like a
centur and has the mount feature as part

348
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
centur and has the mount feature as part
 

349
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,230
centur and has the mount feature as part
of their ancestory then you only have to

350
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,240
of their ancestory then you only have to
 

351
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,869
of their ancestory then you only have to
be one siiz category different so a

352
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:49,879
be one siiz category different so a
 

353
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,350
be one siiz category different so a
medium-sized human could ride a centur

354
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
medium-sized human could ride a centur
 

355
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,710
medium-sized human could ride a centur
that large size whereas they could not

356
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:55,720
that large size whereas they could not

00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,360
if it was a minur in that case the minor
 

359
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,950
if it was a minur in that case the minor
would just be carrying

360
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
would just be carrying
 

361
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,390

balanced on your back in ensuring
 

391
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,029
balanced on your back in ensuring
they're firmly mounted so um so if you

392
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:42,039
they're firmly mounted so um so if you
 

393
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,269
they're firmly mounted so um so if you
do want to lighten the load a little bit

394
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
do want to lighten the load a little bit

do want to lighten the load a little bit
of the rule that says you only are going

of the rule that says you only are going

to start each turn with two actions
 

399
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,030
to start each turn with two actions
instead of the normal three then the

400
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,040
instead of the normal three then the
 

401
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,470
instead of the normal three then the
Centaur player could get accommodating

402
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:53,480
Centaur player could get accommodating
 

403
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,110
Centaur player could get accommodating
amount to to offset that a little bit by

00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,120
amount to to offset that a little bit by
 

405
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,470
amount to to offset that a little bit by
giving the person rotting upon them

406
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:57,480

their fourth reactions
 

409
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,870
their fourth reactions
so there are a number of other things

410
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:01,880
so there are a number of other things
 

411
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,350
so there are a number of other things
that we might want to look at uh

412
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,360
that we might want to look at uh
 

413
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,190
that we might want to look at uh
questions that come up um in regard to

414
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
questions that come up um in regard to
 

415
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,310
questions that come up um in regard to
this and I will

416
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
this and I will
 

417
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,829
this and I will
say there's going to have to be a little

418
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:10,839
say there's going to have to be a little
 

419
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,069
say there's going to have to be a little
bit of GM interpretation for a lot of

420
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:13,079
bit of GM interpretation for a lot of
 

421
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,269
bit of GM interpretation for a lot of
this GM is going to have to think about

422
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,279
this GM is going to have to think about
 

423
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,350
this GM is going to have to think about
the rules as written and the rules as

424
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,360
the rules as written and the rules as
 

425
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,670
the rules as written and the rules as
intended or interpreted and uh what's

426
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
intended or interpreted and uh what's
 

427
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,949
intended or interpreted and uh what's
going to be most uh most narratively

428
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
going to be most uh most narratively
 

429
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,590
going to be most uh most narratively
satisfying and most importantly fun for

430
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
satisfying and most importantly fun for
 

431
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,509
satisfying and most importantly fun for
your players as you figure out how to

432
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:26,519
your players as you figure out how to
 

433
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,550
your players as you figure out how to
use each of these rules but the first is

434
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
use each of these rules but the first is
 

435
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,790
use each of these rules but the first is
going to be the question about bulk so

436
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
going to be the question about bulk so
 

437
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,430
going to be the question about bulk so
if uh if one player is writing upon

438
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
if uh if one player is writing upon
 

439
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,069
if uh if one player is writing upon
another player uh do we need to enforce

440
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:37,079
another player uh do we need to enforce
 

441
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,829
another player uh do we need to enforce
bulk rules I would assume so and so uh

442
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:40,839
bulk rules I would assume so and so uh
 

443
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,710
bulk rules I would assume so and so uh
if you want to know what the bulk of a

444
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
if you want to know what the bulk of a
 

445
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,829
if you want to know what the bulk of a
character is that's going to be found in

446
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:44,839
character is that's going to be found in
 

447
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,190
character is that's going to be found in
player core one there's a table on page

448
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
player core one there's a table on page
 

449
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,190
player core one there's a table on page
269 that gives you sort of a rough

450
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
269 that gives you sort of a rough
 

451
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,710
269 that gives you sort of a rough
average bulk for a creature by uh size

452
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:55,720
average bulk for a creature by uh size
 

453
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,110
average bulk for a creature by uh size
category and then you would just take

454
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120
category and then you would just take
 

455
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,870
category and then you would just take
the additional B that that character is

456
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
the additional B that that character is
 

457
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,990
the additional B that that character is
carrying add those two numbers together

458
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,000
carrying add those two numbers together
 

459
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,190
carrying add those two numbers together
and that would be the bulk of what the

460
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:06,200
and that would be the bulk of what the
 

461
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,910
and that would be the bulk of what the
uh the creature being ridden upon is now

462
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:08,920
uh the creature being ridden upon is now
 

463
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,470
uh the creature being ridden upon is now
having to

464
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
having to
 

465
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,790
having to
accommodate another question would be

466
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
accommodate another question would be
 

467
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,590
accommodate another question would be
about mounted Feats so especially if

468
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
about mounted Feats so especially if
 

469
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,230
about mounted Feats so especially if
maybe like you're you're a Cavalier you

470
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
maybe like you're you're a Cavalier you
 

471
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,550
maybe like you're you're a Cavalier you
might have a lot of Feats that they that

472
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
might have a lot of Feats that they that
 

473
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,670
might have a lot of Feats that they that
give you special abilities and features

474
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:22,680
give you special abilities and features
 

475
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,430
give you special abilities and features
while you are

476
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,440
while you are
 

477
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,590
while you are
mounted so how does this apply to riding

478
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:28,600
mounted so how does this apply to riding
 

479
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,230
mounted so how does this apply to riding
another piece c um the section on

480
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,240
another piece c um the section on
 

481
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,590
another piece c um the section on
running PC doesn't really go into this

482
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
running PC doesn't really go into this
 

483
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,870
running PC doesn't really go into this
so again this is going to be a place

484

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,630
jousting trait uh just not really
functional uh so as as with my other

804
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
functional uh so as as with my other
 

805
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,950
functional uh so as as with my other
recommendations I say you know do what

806
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
recommendations I say you know do what
 

807
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,870
recommendations I say you know do what
makes sense and what makes fun uh and I

808
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:43,880
makes sense and what makes fun uh and I
 

809
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,870
makes sense and what makes fun uh and I
would say as long as during the uh turn

810
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
would say as long as during the uh turn
 

811
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,630
would say as long as during the uh turn
of the person being ridden during that

812
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,640
of the person being ridden during that
 

813
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,110
of the person being ridden during that
turn if they move 10 ft at least uh then

814
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,120
turn if they move 10 ft at least uh then
 

815
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,070
turn if they move 10 ft at least uh then
I would allow the character writing to

816
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
I would allow the character writing to
 

817
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,310
I would allow the character writing to
make that strike and get the bonus I've

818
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
make that strike and get the bonus I've
 

819
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,470
make that strike and get the bonus I've
actually not had this this situation

820
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
actually not had this this situation
 

821
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,430
actually not had this this situation
come up in my own games yet but I I

822
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:06,440
come up in my own games yet but I I
 

823
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,270
come up in my own games yet but I I
think I would probably give them the

824
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:08,280
think I would probably give them the
 

825
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,669
think I would probably give them the
freedom to intermingle their three

826
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
freedom to intermingle their three
 

827
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,830
freedom to intermingle their three
actions and use them however makes sense

828
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
actions and use them however makes sense
 

829
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,590
actions and use them however makes sense
that can get fuzzy when you're getting

830
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
that can get fuzzy when you're getting
 

831
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,830
that can get fuzzy when you're getting
to things like uh if they're suffering

832
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
to things like uh if they're suffering
 

833
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,270
to things like uh if they're suffering
persistent damage when does that

834
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
persistent damage when does that
 

835
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,510
persistent damage when does that
persistent damage kick in stuff like

836
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
persistent damage kick in stuff like
 

837
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,630
persistent damage kick in stuff like
that but uh it that just seems to make

838
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
that but uh it that just seems to make
 

839
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,549
that but uh it that just seems to make
more sense to me and be easier for the

840
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:29,559
more sense to me and be easier for the
 

841
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,270
more sense to me and be easier for the
players to understand if you say uh okay

842
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
players to understand if you say uh okay
 

843

action to make your strike just makes it

852
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
action to make your strike just makes it
 

853
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,549

easier my rules uh so I would allow that
