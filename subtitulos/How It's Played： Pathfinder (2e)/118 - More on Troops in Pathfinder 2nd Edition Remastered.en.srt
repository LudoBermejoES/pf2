Hey everybody, Dave here with another

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,560
Hey everybody, Dave here with another
 

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,030
Hey everybody, Dave here with another
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And
 

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,590
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And
today I'm just doing a little followup

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
today I'm just doing a little followup
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,190
today I'm just doing a little followup
to my previous video on troops. Last

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
to my previous video on troops. Last
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,190
to my previous video on troops. Last
week I put out one of my, you know,

10
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
week I put out one of my, you know,
 

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,669
week I put out one of my, you know,
regular how was played videos on the

12
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
regular how was played videos on the
 

13
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,310
regular how was played videos on the
remastered rules for troops and it

14
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
remastered rules for troops and it
 

15
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,590
remastered rules for troops and it
generated a lot of interesting

16
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
generated a lot of interesting
 

17
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,870
generated a lot of interesting
conversation and a lot of good

18
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
conversation and a lot of good
 

19
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,109
conversation and a lot of good
questions. And I did realize there's

20
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
questions. And I did realize there's
 

21
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,830
questions. And I did realize there's
maybe a point or two that in hindsight I

22
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
maybe a point or two that in hindsight I
 

23
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,230
maybe a point or two that in hindsight I
wish I had included in that video or or

24
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
wish I had included in that video or or
 

25
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,470
wish I had included in that video or or
made more clear in that video. So, I

26
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
made more clear in that video. So, I
 

27
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,549
made more clear in that video. So, I
figured I'd just do a rule reminder as a

28
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
figured I'd just do a rule reminder as a
 

29
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,630
figured I'd just do a rule reminder as a
follow-up to address a few of these

30
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
follow-up to address a few of these
 

31
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,350
follow-up to address a few of these
issues. Since this is following up on

32
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
issues. Since this is following up on
 

33
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,910
issues. Since this is following up on
that video, I do strongly encourage you

34
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
that video, I do strongly encourage you
 

35
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,430
that video, I do strongly encourage you
to go watch that video first, the how

36
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
to go watch that video first, the how
 

37
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,670
to go watch that video first, the how
it's played video about the remastered

38
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
it's played video about the remastered
 

39
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,630
it's played video about the remastered
version of troops and then continue on

40
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
version of troops and then continue on
 

41
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,069
version of troops and then continue on
with this video here. I will leave a

42
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
with this video here. I will leave a
 

43
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,389
with this video here. I will leave a
link to that video in the comment

44
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
link to that video in the comment
 

45
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,630
link to that video in the comment
section for you to click on. And um a

section for you to click on. And um a
 

47
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,310
section for you to click on. And um a
lot of the questions that came up seem

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
lot of the questions that came up seem
 

49
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,270
lot of the questions that came up seem
to stem from a a misunderstanding of how

50
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
to stem from a a misunderstanding of how
 

51
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,429
to stem from a a misunderstanding of how
do you target the troops and the

52
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
do you target the troops and the
 

53
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,070
do you target the troops and the
segments of the troops with whatever

54
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
segments of the troops with whatever
 

55
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,670
segments of the troops with whatever
effect, ability, spell, attack or

56
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
effect, ability, spell, attack or
 

57
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,230
effect, ability, spell, attack or
whatever you want to inflict upon that

58
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,240
whatever you want to inflict upon that
 

59
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,670
whatever you want to inflict upon that
troop. And so I want to try to clarify

60
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
troop. And so I want to try to clarify
 

61
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,070
troop. And so I want to try to clarify
that uh as best I can. So the first

62
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
that uh as best I can. So the first
 

63
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,550
that uh as best I can. So the first
thing you need to do is anytime uh you

64
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
thing you need to do is anytime uh you
 

65
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,630
thing you need to do is anytime uh you
are are going to attack or in any way

66
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,640
are are going to attack or in any way
 

67
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,190
are are going to attack or in any way
affect a troop, you need to think is

68
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
affect a troop, you need to think is
 

69
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,390
affect a troop, you need to think is
this a damaging effect or is this a

70
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
this a damaging effect or is this a
 

71
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,789
this a damaging effect or is this a
non-damaging effect and kind of even

72
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
non-damaging effect and kind of even
 

73
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,190
non-damaging effect and kind of even
think of it as as two separate tracks in

74
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
think of it as as two separate tracks in
 

75
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,670
think of it as as two separate tracks in
your mind because the rules of how you

76
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
your mind because the rules of how you
 

77
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,030
your mind because the rules of how you
target with damaging effects is

78
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
target with damaging effects is
 

79
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,670
target with damaging effects is
different than how you would apply the

80
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
different than how you would apply the
 

81
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,870
different than how you would apply the
rules for non-damaging effects. So, for

82
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
rules for non-damaging effects. So, for
 

83
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,030
rules for non-damaging effects. So, for
example, uh you're making a melee

84
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
example, uh you're making a melee
 

85
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,950
example, uh you're making a melee
strike. You're sending adjacent to the

86
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
strike. You're sending adjacent to the
 

87
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,550
strike. You're sending adjacent to the
troop. You have a sword. You're going to

88
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
troop. You have a sword. You're going to
 

89
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,350
troop. You have a sword. You're going to
spend one action to do

90
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,360
spend one action to do
 

91
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,030
spend one action to do
strike. All you have to do since this is

92
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
strike. All you have to do since this is
 

93
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,350
strike. All you have to do since this is
a damaging effect, the result of it will

94
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
a damaging effect, the result of it will
 

95
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,749
a damaging effect, the result of it will
be damage, is target any single square

96
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
be damage, is target any single square
 

97
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,150
be damage, is target any single square
of the troop as a whole. Doesn't matter

98
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
of the troop as a whole. Doesn't matter
 

99
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,309
of the troop as a whole. Doesn't matter
what segment you're attacking. You just

100
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
what segment you're attacking. You just
 

101
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,110
what segment you're attacking. You just
got to be within range of your attack as

102
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
got to be within range of your attack as
 

103
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,390
got to be within range of your attack as
normal to any square of the troop. And

104
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
normal to any square of the troop. And
 

105
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,750
normal to any square of the troop. And
if you hit, then that damage is going to

106
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
if you hit, then that damage is going to
 

107
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,070
if you hit, then that damage is going to
be applied to the troop as a whole.

108
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
be applied to the troop as a whole.
 

109
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,670
be applied to the troop as a whole.
There's one one bucket of hit points for

110
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
There's one one bucket of hit points for
 

111
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,030
There's one one bucket of hit points for
the entire troop. That's a really simple

112
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
the entire troop. That's a really simple
 

113
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,190
the entire troop. That's a really simple
uh example that I I I don't think is

114
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
uh example that I I I don't think is
 

115
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,830
uh example that I I I don't think is
going to confuse anybody. But then comes

116
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
going to confuse anybody. But then comes
 

117
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,910
going to confuse anybody. But then comes
the up questions of well what if I cast

118
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
the up questions of well what if I cast
 

119
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,150
the up questions of well what if I cast
a fireball spell and the fireball's area

120
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
a fireball spell and the fireball's area
 

121
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,550
a fireball spell and the fireball's area
of effect is so large that it can fit

122
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
of effect is so large that it can fit
 

123
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,070
of effect is so large that it can fit
two or more incomplete segments in that

124
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,080
two or more incomplete segments in that
 

125
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,949
two or more incomplete segments in that
blast. So uh if I'm hitting three

126
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
blast. So uh if I'm hitting three
 

127
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,229
blast. So uh if I'm hitting three
segments of the of the troop, does each

128
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
segments of the of the troop, does each
 

129
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,949
segments of the of the troop, does each
segment roll its own individual reflex

130
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
segment roll its own individual reflex
 

131
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,589
segment roll its own individual reflex
save? And if they all fail those saves,

132
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
save? And if they all fail those saves,
 

133
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,790
save? And if they all fail those saves,
do I then apply the fireball effect

134
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
do I then apply the fireball effect
 

135
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,750
do I then apply the fireball effect
three times? And the answer is no. When

136
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
three times? And the answer is no. When
 

137
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,270
three times? And the answer is no. When
you are dealing with a damaging effect,

138
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
you are dealing with a damaging effect,
 

139
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,110
you are dealing with a damaging effect,
fireball deals damage as a damaging

140
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
fireball deals damage as a damaging
 

141
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,190
fireball deals damage as a damaging
effect. then you only have to target one

142
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
effect. then you only have to target one
 

143
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,869
effect. then you only have to target one
square of the troop and you only treat

144
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
square of the troop and you only treat
 

145
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,830
square of the troop and you only treat
the defenses of the troop one time and

146
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
the defenses of the troop one time and
 

147
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,949
the defenses of the troop one time and
you only apply the damage one time for

148
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
you only apply the damage one time for
 

149
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,470
you only apply the damage one time for
the um for the entire troop. So

150
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,480
the um for the entire troop. So
 

151
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,149
the um for the entire troop. So
basically in most situations when you're

152
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
basically in most situations when you're
 

153
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,110
basically in most situations when you're
talking about doing a damaging effect,

154
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
talking about doing a damaging effect,
 

155
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,110
talking about doing a damaging effect,
you're not going to worry about segments

156
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
you're not going to worry about segments
 

157
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,830
you're not going to worry about segments
at all. uh only for the purposes of

158
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:42,840
at all. uh only for the purposes of
 

159
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,670
at all. uh only for the purposes of
determining range and cover and things

160
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
determining range and cover and things
 

161
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,949
determining range and cover and things
like that. But by raw, if just one

162
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
like that. But by raw, if just one
 

163
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,430
like that. But by raw, if just one
square of the troop is in the range of a

164
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,440
square of the troop is in the range of a
 

165
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,789
square of the troop is in the range of a
fireball, then the fireball is going to

166
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
fireball, then the fireball is going to
 

167
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,830
fireball, then the fireball is going to
have its total normal effect. And if the

168
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
have its total normal effect. And if the
 

169
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,149
have its total normal effect. And if the
entire troop is within the range of the

170
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
entire troop is within the range of the
 

171
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,789
entire troop is within the range of the
fireball, again, it's only going to

172
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
fireball, again, it's only going to
 

173
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,309
fireball, again, it's only going to
attack once. There's only going to be

174
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
attack once. There's only going to be
 

175
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,589
attack once. There's only going to be
one reflex save for the entire troop and

176
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
one reflex save for the entire troop and
 

177
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,630
one reflex save for the entire troop and
the damage and potential weaknesses to

178
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
the damage and potential weaknesses to
 

179
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,869
the damage and potential weaknesses to
uh area effects, all that is applied one

180
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:13,879
uh area effects, all that is applied one
 

181
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,830
uh area effects, all that is applied one
time. Now, I know that for a lot of

182
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
time. Now, I know that for a lot of
 

183
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,830
time. Now, I know that for a lot of
people that's counterintuitive and for a

184
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
people that's counterintuitive and for a
 

185
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,349
people that's counterintuitive and for a
lot of people it's like, hey, look, it

186
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
lot of people it's like, hey, look, it
 

187
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,950
lot of people it's like, hey, look, it
doesn't make any sense to apply the

188
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
doesn't make any sense to apply the
 

189
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,350
doesn't make any sense to apply the
whole damage to just, you know, just

190
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
whole damage to just, you know, just
 

191
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,990
whole damage to just, you know, just
cause one little corner, one square on

192
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
cause one little corner, one square on
 

193
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,909
cause one little corner, one square on
the end. Uh, and we'll talk about

194
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
the end. Uh, and we'll talk about
 

195
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,870
the end. Uh, and we'll talk about
situations like that in a second, but

196
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
situations like that in a second, but
 

197
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,550
situations like that in a second, but
rules as written, that's how a damaging

198
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
rules as written, that's how a damaging
 

199
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,110
rules as written, that's how a damaging
effect would work. So, now let's talk

200
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
effect would work. So, now let's talk
 

201
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,270
effect would work. So, now let's talk
about non-damaging

202
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,280
about non-damaging
 

203
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,990
about non-damaging
effects. So, non-damaging effects are

204
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
effects. So, non-damaging effects are
 

205
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,510
effects. So, non-damaging effects are
going to potentially apply to specific

206
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,520
going to potentially apply to specific
 

207
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,469
going to potentially apply to specific
segments and not to the troop as a whole

208
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
segments and not to the troop as a whole
 

209
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,790
segments and not to the troop as a whole
necessarily.

210
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
necessarily.
 

211
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,310
necessarily.
When you are targeting with a

212
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
When you are targeting with a
 

213
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,749
When you are targeting with a
non-damaging effect, you um well, the

214
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
non-damaging effect, you um well, the
 

215
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,070
non-damaging effect, you um well, the
first thing is any non-damaging effect

216
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
first thing is any non-damaging effect
 

217
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,950
first thing is any non-damaging effect
that only targets a single creature has

218
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
that only targets a single creature has
 

219
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,550
that only targets a single creature has
no effect at all on the troop as a on

220
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
no effect at all on the troop as a on
 

221
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,390
no effect at all on the troop as a on
troops period. So, if you have a

222
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
troops period. So, if you have a
 

223
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,950
troops period. So, if you have a
non-damaging effect, it only targets one

224
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
non-damaging effect, it only targets one
 

225
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,670
non-damaging effect, it only targets one
person. So, for example, a charm spell

226
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
person. So, for example, a charm spell
 

227
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,510
person. So, for example, a charm spell
that's not heightened, it only targets

228
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
that's not heightened, it only targets
 

229
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,189
that's not heightened, it only targets
one person, is not going to have any

230
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
one person, is not going to have any
 

231
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,629
one person, is not going to have any
effect at all on the troop.

232
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
effect at all on the troop.
 

233
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,350
effect at all on the troop.
In order for you to use a non-damaging

234
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
In order for you to use a non-damaging
 

235
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,749
In order for you to use a non-damaging
effect against a troop, it has to be

236
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
effect against a troop, it has to be
 

237
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,590
effect against a troop, it has to be
able to either target five or more

238
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
able to either target five or more
 

239
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,430
able to either target five or more
targets, five or more creatures or you

240
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
targets, five or more creatures or you
 

241
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,430
targets, five or more creatures or you
have to be able to fit all four squares

242
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
have to be able to fit all four squares
 

243
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,870
have to be able to fit all four squares
of a segment in the in the area effect

244
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
of a segment in the in the area effect
 

245
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,830
of a segment in the in the area effect
of that. So, if you had like an aura

246
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:46,840
of that. So, if you had like an aura
 

247
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,629
of that. So, if you had like an aura
effect, then you know, you were um

248
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
effect, then you know, you were um
 

249
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,909
effect, then you know, you were um
casting Bane and you had sustained it

250
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
casting Bane and you had sustained it
 

251
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,310
casting Bane and you had sustained it
enough that it

252
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,320
enough that it
 

253
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,150
enough that it
expanded, all of an entire segment would

254
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
expanded, all of an entire segment would
 

255
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,710
expanded, all of an entire segment would
have to be within that area for that to

256
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
have to be within that area for that to
 

257
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,590
have to be within that area for that to
have an effect upon it. Now, things get

258
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
have an effect upon it. Now, things get
 

259
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,870
have an effect upon it. Now, things get
a little bit weird when you start

260
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
a little bit weird when you start
 

261
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,710
a little bit weird when you start
thinking about exactly what those

262
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
thinking about exactly what those
 

263
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,670
thinking about exactly what those
effects are and how they impact things.

264
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
effects are and how they impact things.
 

265
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,270
effects are and how they impact things.
So, I I guess the the next thing to to

266
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
So, I I guess the the next thing to to
 

267
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,830
So, I I guess the the next thing to to
talk about is going to be the the actual

268
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
talk about is going to be the the actual
 

269
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,670
talk about is going to be the the actual
text from the rule book. And I wish I'd

270
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
text from the rule book. And I wish I'd
 

271
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,469
text from the rule book. And I wish I'd
included this in the uh earlier video.

272
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
included this in the uh earlier video.
 

273
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,029
included this in the uh earlier video.
Uh I talked about how this is going to

274
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
Uh I talked about how this is going to
 

275
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,309
Uh I talked about how this is going to
be a system where a lot of the decisions

276
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
be a system where a lot of the decisions
 

277
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,550
be a system where a lot of the decisions
are going to be up to the GMs. Like,

278
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
are going to be up to the GMs. Like,
 

279
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,430
are going to be up to the GMs. Like,
you're just going to have to make

280
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
you're just going to have to make
 

281
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,870
you're just going to have to make
judgment calls. You're going to have to

282
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
judgment calls. You're going to have to
 

283
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,189
judgment calls. You're going to have to
look at the situation and say, "I think

284
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
look at the situation and say, "I think
 

285
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,790
look at the situation and say, "I think
this makes sense or it doesn't make

286
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
this makes sense or it doesn't make
 

287
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,110
this makes sense or it doesn't make
sense." and just decide how you're going

288
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
sense." and just decide how you're going
 

289
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,070
sense." and just decide how you're going
to apply any of these effects. Uh

290
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,080
to apply any of these effects. Uh
 

291
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,510
to apply any of these effects. Uh
because the there's so many different

292
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
because the there's so many different
 

293
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,870
because the there's so many different
variations of so many different

294
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
variations of so many different
 

295
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,950
variations of so many different
conditions and so many different effects

296
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
conditions and so many different effects
 

297
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,469
conditions and so many different effects
and so many different situations of how

298
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
and so many different situations of how
 

299
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,990
and so many different situations of how
a troop may be oriented and how a map

300
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
a troop may be oriented and how a map
 

301
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,590
a troop may be oriented and how a map
may be shaped and environmental

302
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
may be shaped and environmental
 

303
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,749
may be shaped and environmental
conditions that the book really doesn't

304
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
conditions that the book really doesn't
 

305
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,150
conditions that the book really doesn't
get into uh any kind of uh by

306
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
get into uh any kind of uh by
 

307
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,029
get into uh any kind of uh by
raw coals on conditions and specific

308
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
raw coals on conditions and specific
 

309
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,350
raw coals on conditions and specific
effects. Uh instead again they give you

310
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
effects. Uh instead again they give you
 

311
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,189
effects. Uh instead again they give you
rules for targeting and they leave it up

312
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
rules for targeting and they leave it up
 

313
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,189
rules for targeting and they leave it up
to you to figure out what happens. But

314
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
to you to figure out what happens. But
 

315
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,070
to you to figure out what happens. But
this um this text says the rules for

316
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
this um this text says the rules for
 

317
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,990
this um this text says the rules for
troops especially troop defenses cover

318
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
troops especially troop defenses cover
 

319
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,830
troops especially troop defenses cover
many circumstances where it's important

320
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
many circumstances where it's important
 

321
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,029
many circumstances where it's important
that troops are not all one entity.

322
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
that troops are not all one entity.
 

323
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,029
that troops are not all one entity.
However, the rules can't cover every

324
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
However, the rules can't cover every
 

325
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,390
However, the rules can't cover every
possibility and it's best to use common

326
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400
possibility and it's best to use common
 

327
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,230
possibility and it's best to use common
sense. And uh this is the the piece that

328
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
sense. And uh this is the the piece that
 

329
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,830
sense. And uh this is the the piece that
I wish I had included in my previous

330
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
I wish I had included in my previous
 

331
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,110
I wish I had included in my previous
video. If a player uses an ability you

332
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
video. If a player uses an ability you
 

333
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,430
video. If a player uses an ability you
don't think works on a troop, discuss

334
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
don't think works on a troop, discuss
 

335
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,629
don't think works on a troop, discuss
with that player and refund actions

336
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
with that player and refund actions
 

337
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,309
with that player and refund actions
spent based on mistaken

338
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:45,319
spent based on mistaken
 

339
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,430
spent based on mistaken
assumptions. So the rules are really

340
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
assumptions. So the rules are really
 

341
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,510
assumptions. So the rules are really
just saying, you know, like, hey,

342
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
just saying, you know, like, hey,
 

343
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,990
just saying, you know, like, hey,
everybody, players and GMs alike are

344
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
everybody, players and GMs alike are
 

345
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,990
everybody, players and GMs alike are
going to have to understand that this is

346
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
going to have to understand that this is
 

347
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,670
going to have to understand that this is
going to be up to GM interpretation to a

348
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
going to be up to GM interpretation to a
 

349
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,110
going to be up to GM interpretation to a
greater degree than what is. So try not

350
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
greater degree than what is. So try not
 

351
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,710
greater degree than what is. So try not
to, you know, say, "Oh, you took your

352
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
to, you know, say, "Oh, you took your
 

353
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,710
to, you know, say, "Oh, you took your
your hand off the chest piece. You you

354
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
your hand off the chest piece. You you
 

355
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,990
your hand off the chest piece. You you
said you were going to do X and too bad.

356
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
said you were going to do X and too bad.
 

357
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,230
said you were going to do X and too bad.
It has no effect and your turn was

358
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
It has no effect and your turn was
 

359
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,150
It has no effect and your turn was
wasted." Well, that's not fun for

360
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
wasted." Well, that's not fun for
 

361
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,430
wasted." Well, that's not fun for
players, that's probably not fun for the

362
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
players, that's probably not fun for the
 

363
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,990
players, that's probably not fun for the
GM either.

364
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,000
GM either.
 

365
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,670
GM either.
So the recommendation, which I think is

366
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
So the recommendation, which I think is
 

367
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,990
So the recommendation, which I think is
a good recommendation, is if the players

368
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
a good recommendation, is if the players
 

369
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,670
a good recommendation, is if the players
want to do something, they say they take

370
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
want to do something, they say they take
 

371
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,869
want to do something, they say they take
their actions to do something, and then

372
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
their actions to do something, and then
 

373
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,110
their actions to do something, and then
you process it and you decide, you know

374
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
you process it and you decide, you know
 

375
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,309
you process it and you decide, you know
what, that's not going to have an effect

376
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
what, that's not going to have an effect
 

377
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,790
what, that's not going to have an effect
on the troop, give them back their

378
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
on the troop, give them back their
 

379
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,950
on the troop, give them back their
actions. Let them try again. Make sure

380
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
actions. Let them try again. Make sure
 

381
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,070
actions. Let them try again. Make sure
everybody's on the same

382
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,080
everybody's on the same
 

383
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,430
everybody's on the same
page. So, um, a couple of different, um,

384
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
page. So, um, a couple of different, um,
 

385
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,029
page. So, um, a couple of different, um,
things that were put into the comments

386
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
things that were put into the comments
 

387
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,949
things that were put into the comments
that might be worth looking at. Uh, can

388
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
that might be worth looking at. Uh, can
 

389
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,150
that might be worth looking at. Uh, can
a troop be flanked? Well, okay. So,

390
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
a troop be flanked? Well, okay. So,
 

391
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,550
a troop be flanked? Well, okay. So,
let's think about this. Flanking, if

392
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
let's think about this. Flanking, if
 

393
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,870
let's think about this. Flanking, if
you're imposing flanking, if that is, is

394
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
you're imposing flanking, if that is, is
 

395
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,389
you're imposing flanking, if that is, is
that going to be a damaging effect or a

396
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
that going to be a damaging effect or a
 

397
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,790
that going to be a damaging effect or a
non-damaging effect? Well, flanking is a

398
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
non-damaging effect? Well, flanking is a
 

399
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,550
non-damaging effect? Well, flanking is a
non-damaging effect. Now, it could lead

400
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
non-damaging effect. Now, it could lead
 

401
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,710
non-damaging effect. Now, it could lead
to damage by making it easier for an

402
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
to damage by making it easier for an
 

403
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,790
to damage by making it easier for an
attack, but flanking is a non-damaging

404
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
attack, but flanking is a non-damaging
 

405
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,030
attack, but flanking is a non-damaging
effect. So unless you have a ability, a

406
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
effect. So unless you have a ability, a
 

407
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,310
effect. So unless you have a ability, a
spell or something that would apply

408
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
spell or something that would apply
 

409
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,030
spell or something that would apply
flanking or the offg guard condition to

410
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
flanking or the offg guard condition to
 

411
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,630
flanking or the offg guard condition to
an area or to five or more targets, then

412
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
an area or to five or more targets, then
 

413
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,030
an area or to five or more targets, then
we fall back on that rule that says that

414
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
we fall back on that rule that says that
 

415
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,310
we fall back on that rule that says that
non-damaging effects only target one

416
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,320
non-damaging effects only target one
 

417
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,509
non-damaging effects only target one
creature. The troops are immune to

418
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
creature. The troops are immune to
 

419
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,670
creature. The troops are immune to
those. So it has no effect at all. So in

420
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
those. So it has no effect at all. So in
 

421
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,910
those. So it has no effect at all. So in
most cases, no. Flanking is not going to

422
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
most cases, no. Flanking is not going to
 

423
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,630
most cases, no. Flanking is not going to
apply to a troop. Uh what about using

424
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
apply to a troop. Uh what about using
 

425
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,550
apply to a troop. Uh what about using
your athletic skill to grab somebody?

426
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
your athletic skill to grab somebody?
 

427
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,070
your athletic skill to grab somebody?
There's nothing in the rules that says

428
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
There's nothing in the rules that says
 

429
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,150
There's nothing in the rules that says
that a troop cannot be grabbed or that

430
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
that a troop cannot be grabbed or that
 

431
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,470
that a troop cannot be grabbed or that
is immune to the grabbed condition.

432
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
is immune to the grabbed condition.
 

433
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,750
is immune to the grabbed condition.
That's true, but again, what are you

434
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
That's true, but again, what are you
 

435
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,470
That's true, but again, what are you
using to impose grabbed, which is a

436
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
using to impose grabbed, which is a
 

437
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,550
using to impose grabbed, which is a
non-damaging effect on this troop? Is it

438
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
non-damaging effect on this troop? Is it
 

439
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,710
non-damaging effect on this troop? Is it
a like the athletic skill is a single

440
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
a like the athletic skill is a single
 

441
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,070
a like the athletic skill is a single
target where you're just literally

442
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
target where you're just literally
 

443
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,870
target where you're just literally
grabbing somebody? Well, uh, first of

444
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
grabbing somebody? Well, uh, first of
 

445
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,389
grabbing somebody? Well, uh, first of
all, common sense would say that

446
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
all, common sense would say that
 

447
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,910
all, common sense would say that
wouldn't impede an entire troop. But

448
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
wouldn't impede an entire troop. But
 

449
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,470
wouldn't impede an entire troop. But
second of all, even in the rules, single

450
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
second of all, even in the rules, single
 

451
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,470
second of all, even in the rules, single
target non-damaging effect would have no

452
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
target non-damaging effect would have no
 

453
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,750
target non-damaging effect would have no
effect at all on the troop. So, uh, no,

454
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
effect at all on the troop. So, uh, no,
 

455
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,430
effect at all on the troop. So, uh, no,
you can't use grab to to uh, you know,

456
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
you can't use grab to to uh, you know,
 

457
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,670
you can't use grab to to uh, you know,
use athletics to grab a a target. Same

458
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
use athletics to grab a a target. Same
 

459
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,110
use athletics to grab a a target. Same
thing with, you know, tripping someone

460
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
thing with, you know, tripping someone
 

461
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,230
thing with, you know, tripping someone
to knock them prone. But if you had some

462
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
to knock them prone. But if you had some
 

463
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,470
to knock them prone. But if you had some
sort of ability or spell, a quick effect

464
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
sort of ability or spell, a quick effect
 

465
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,550
sort of ability or spell, a quick effect
or something that would impose the prone

466
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:17,560
or something that would impose the prone
 

467
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,670
or something that would impose the prone
condition on an entire

468
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:20,680
condition on an entire
 

469
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,949
condition on an entire
segment, then that could work. And then

470
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
segment, then that could work. And then
 

471
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,710
segment, then that could work. And then
the question would be, well, what does

472
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
the question would be, well, what does
 

473
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,509
the question would be, well, what does
that do to that segment? So, anytime a

474
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
that do to that segment? So, anytime a
 

475
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,230
that do to that segment? So, anytime a
segment a an entire segment faces a

476
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
segment a an entire segment faces a
 

477
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,110
segment a an entire segment faces a
non-damaging condition or a non-damaging

478
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,120
non-damaging condition or a non-damaging
 

479
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,310
non-damaging condition or a non-damaging
effect, if that effect would prevent the

480
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
effect, if that effect would prevent the
 

481
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,829
effect, if that effect would prevent the
um the troop from acting uh for an

482
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
um the troop from acting uh for an
 

483
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,790
um the troop from acting uh for an
entire turn,

484
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,800
entire turn,
 

485
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,990
entire turn,
then you assume that is enough for that

486
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
then you assume that is enough for that
 

487
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,630
then you assume that is enough for that
segment to be killed. They've been

488
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
segment to be killed. They've been
 

489
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,269
segment to be killed. They've been
debilitated enough that they would be

490
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
debilitated enough that they would be
 

491
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,350
debilitated enough that they would be
wiped out by their opposing force. and

492
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
wiped out by their opposing force. and
 

493
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,990
wiped out by their opposing force. and
you you lower the hit points to the next

494
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
you you lower the hit points to the next
 

495
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,230
you you lower the hit points to the next
threshold. You remove one segment from

496
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
threshold. You remove one segment from
 

497
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,949
threshold. You remove one segment from
the map, which may or may not be that

498
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
the map, which may or may not be that
 

499
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,470
the map, which may or may not be that
specific segment depending on the

500
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:11,480

 

501
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,790

orientation. But so that's easy if

502
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
orientation. But so that's easy if
 

503
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,230
orientation. But so that's easy if
you're talking about effects that are

504
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
you're talking about effects that are
 

505
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,110
you're talking about effects that are
going to uh you know slow a target to

506
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
going to uh you know slow a target to
 

507
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,949
going to uh you know slow a target to
three actions so that they don't act on

508
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
three actions so that they don't act on
 

509
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,630
three actions so that they don't act on
their next turn. If it's going to

510
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
their next turn. If it's going to
 

511
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,790
their next turn. If it's going to
completely immobilize them for a turn so

512
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
completely immobilize them for a turn so
 

513
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,550
completely immobilize them for a turn so
they can't, you know, freely move and

514
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
they can't, you know, freely move and
 

515
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,190
they can't, you know, freely move and
act for an entire turn, that all makes

516
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
act for an entire turn, that all makes
 

517
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,470
act for an entire turn, that all makes
sense. But what about these effects that

518
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
sense. But what about these effects that
 

519
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,949
sense. But what about these effects that
impose

520
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:35,959
impose
 

521
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,710
impose
penalties but don't impede the segment

522
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
penalties but don't impede the segment
 

523
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,590
penalties but don't impede the segment
from acting? There's nothing in the book

524
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
from acting? There's nothing in the book
 

525
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,550
from acting? There's nothing in the book
that says that effects like that don't

526
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
that says that effects like that don't
 

527
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,470
that says that effects like that don't
work at all and there's nothing in the

528
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
work at all and there's nothing in the
 

529
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,069
work at all and there's nothing in the
effects in the text that says they work

530
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
effects in the text that says they work
 

531
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,870
effects in the text that says they work
as normal. Uh, so I would say the the

532
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
as normal. Uh, so I would say the the
 

533
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,110
as normal. Uh, so I would say the the
raw interpretation would be they act as

534
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
raw interpretation would be they act as
 

535
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,949
raw interpretation would be they act as
normal, but you are as a GM going to

536
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
normal, but you are as a GM going to
 

537
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,790
normal, but you are as a GM going to
have to figure out exactly what does

538
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
have to figure out exactly what does
 

539
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,269
have to figure out exactly what does
that mean for a troop. So, for example,

540
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
that mean for a troop. So, for example,
 

541
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,550
that mean for a troop. So, for example,
let's say you cast the fear spell, you

542
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
let's say you cast the fear spell, you
 

543
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,030
let's say you cast the fear spell, you
heighten it uh to a high enough rank

544
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
heighten it uh to a high enough rank
 

545
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,150
heighten it uh to a high enough rank
that it would affect an entire segment,

546
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
that it would affect an entire segment,
 

547
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,790
that it would affect an entire segment,
they failed their save, and now they're

548
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
they failed their save, and now they're
 

549
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,030
they failed their save, and now they're
they're facing frightened one or

550
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
they're facing frightened one or
 

551
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,110
they're facing frightened one or
frightened two um from that. Now, if you

552
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
frightened two um from that. Now, if you
 

553
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,470
frightened two um from that. Now, if you
if they critically fail on something

554
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
if they critically fail on something
 

555
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,069
if they critically fail on something
like that and they have to flee, then I

556
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
like that and they have to flee, then I
 

557
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,590
like that and they have to flee, then I
would say that they're not acting as

558
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
would say that they're not acting as
 

559
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,990
would say that they're not acting as
normal for an entire turn next turn and

560
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
normal for an entire turn next turn and
 

561
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,069
normal for an entire turn next turn and
fall back on that ruling. But if it's

562
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
fall back on that ruling. But if it's
 

563
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,629
fall back on that ruling. But if it's
just frighten one or frighten two, they

564
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
just frighten one or frighten two, they
 

565
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,750
just frighten one or frighten two, they
can still take all three of their

566
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
can still take all three of their
 

567
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,750
can still take all three of their
actions, but we're only talking about

568
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
actions, but we're only talking about
 

569
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,190
actions, but we're only talking about
one segment. So, what does this mean for

570
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
one segment. So, what does this mean for
 

571
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,030
one segment. So, what does this mean for
the game?

572
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
the game?
 

573
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,110
the game?
My ruling in a situation like that would

574
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,120
My ruling in a situation like that would
 

575
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,750
My ruling in a situation like that would
be any attacks made by the troop against

576
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
be any attacks made by the troop against
 

577
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,790
be any attacks made by the troop against
an enemy that can only be targeted by

578
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
an enemy that can only be targeted by
 

579
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,310
an enemy that can only be targeted by
that segment. If if if a PC is on the

580
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
that segment. If if if a PC is on the
 

581
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,550
that segment. If if if a PC is on the
map in such an orientation that only uh

582
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
map in such an orientation that only uh
 

583
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,389
map in such an orientation that only uh
that they're only in range of the troop

584
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
that they're only in range of the troop
 

585
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,350
that they're only in range of the troop
through that segment is affected by

586
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,360
through that segment is affected by
 

587
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,470
through that segment is affected by
fear, then I would subtract uh the

588
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
fear, then I would subtract uh the
 

589
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,470
fear, then I would subtract uh the
appropriate amount of fear one or two

590
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
appropriate amount of fear one or two
 

591
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,750
appropriate amount of fear one or two
from their attack roles uh against that

592
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
from their attack roles uh against that
 

593
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,310
from their attack roles uh against that
one specific player, but it wouldn't

594
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
one specific player, but it wouldn't
 

595
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,590
one specific player, but it wouldn't
have any effect at all on other players

596
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
have any effect at all on other players
 

597
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,590
have any effect at all on other players
who are in range of other segments that

598
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
who are in range of other segments that
 

599
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,389
who are in range of other segments that
are not affected by fear.

600
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
are not affected by fear.
 

601
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,190
are not affected by fear.
Same thing if uh if a PC is attacking

602
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
Same thing if uh if a PC is attacking
 

603
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,710
Same thing if uh if a PC is attacking
the troop, even though like I said

604
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:23,720
the troop, even though like I said
 

605
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,910
the troop, even though like I said
before, all you got to do is target one

606
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:26,920
before, all you got to do is target one
 

607
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,829
before, all you got to do is target one
square. Well, if that square happens to

608
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
square. Well, if that square happens to
 

609
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,430
square. Well, if that square happens to
belong to a segment that is affected by

610
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
belong to a segment that is affected by
 

611
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,350
belong to a segment that is affected by
fear, I would lower their reflex save

612
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
fear, I would lower their reflex save
 

613
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,949
fear, I would lower their reflex save
their armor class by the appropriate

614
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
their armor class by the appropriate
 

615
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,069
their armor class by the appropriate
amount for that attack. Uh but not

616
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
amount for that attack. Uh but not
 

617
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,670
amount for that attack. Uh but not
obviously for other attacks that are

618
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
obviously for other attacks that are
 

619
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,670
obviously for other attacks that are
targeting the troop through other

620
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
targeting the troop through other
 

621
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,430
targeting the troop through other
segments, if that makes any sense at

622
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
segments, if that makes any sense at
 

623
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,389
segments, if that makes any sense at
all. But

624
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:45,399
all. But
 

625
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,150
all. But
again, this is going to have to be

626
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
again, this is going to have to be
 

627
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,910
again, this is going to have to be
something that every

628
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:50,920
something that every
 

629
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,710
something that every
GM just reviews the situation and makes

630
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
GM just reviews the situation and makes
 

631
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,230
GM just reviews the situation and makes
their own calls. But the major thing

632
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
their own calls. But the major thing
 

633
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,990
their own calls. But the major thing
that I wanted to kind of get across that

634
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
that I wanted to kind of get across that
 

635

that I wanted to kind of get across that
I think people were getting confused in

636
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
I think people were getting confused in

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,509
I think people were getting confused in
my comments was

638
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:04,519
my comments was
 

639
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,829
my comments was
about damaging

640
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:06,839
about damaging
 

641
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,550
about damaging
effects are targeting the troop. So, it

642
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
effects are targeting the troop. So, it
 

643
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,470
effects are targeting the troop. So, it
doesn't matter how much of the troop is

644
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
doesn't matter how much of the troop is
 

645
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,670
doesn't matter how much of the troop is
in the area of the attack, it's only

646
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
in the area of the attack, it's only
 

647
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,069
in the area of the attack, it's only
going to be one attack roll against

648
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
going to be one attack roll against
 

649
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,350
going to be one attack roll against
their armor class. There's only going to

650
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
their armor class. There's only going to
 

651
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,710
their armor class. There's only going to
be one reflex save against your spell

652
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:21,720
be one reflex save against your spell
 

653
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,110
be one reflex save against your spell
DC. Uh, no matter if it's one square or

654
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
DC. Uh, no matter if it's one square or
 

655
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,750
DC. Uh, no matter if it's one square or
16 squares that are within range of that

656
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
16 squares that are within range of that
 

657
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,470
16 squares that are within range of that
effect being targeted. It is the

658
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
effect being targeted. It is the
 

659
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,430
effect being targeted. It is the
non-damaging effects where you have to

660
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
non-damaging effects where you have to
 

661
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,710
non-damaging effects where you have to
evaluate it on a segmentby segment basis

662
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
evaluate it on a segmentby segment basis
 

663
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,590
evaluate it on a segmentby segment basis
and each segment is going to manage

664
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
and each segment is going to manage
 

665
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,389
and each segment is going to manage
their saving throws and their defenses

666
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:43,399
their saving throws and their defenses
 

667
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,389
their saving throws and their defenses
individually.

668
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:45,399
individually.
 

669
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,750
individually.
Um, and so again, you as the GM, you're

670
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
Um, and so again, you as the GM, you're
 

671
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,269
Um, and so again, you as the GM, you're
going to have to make judgment calls on

672
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
going to have to make judgment calls on
 

673
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,150
going to have to make judgment calls on
what then happens. If they're not able

674
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
what then happens. If they're not able
 

675
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,550
what then happens. If they're not able
to function as normal for an entire

676
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
to function as normal for an entire
 

677
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,110
to function as normal for an entire
round, they're wiped out. anything short

678
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
round, they're wiped out. anything short
 

679
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,629
round, they're wiped out. anything short
of that, you're going to have to make a

680
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
of that, you're going to have to make a
 

681
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,550
of that, you're going to have to make a
judgment call as to how it affects. Now,

682
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
judgment call as to how it affects. Now,
 

683
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,750
judgment call as to how it affects. Now,
the other thing that I wanted to um to

684
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
the other thing that I wanted to um to
 

685
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,230
the other thing that I wanted to um to
share in the first video, and I just

686
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
share in the first video, and I just
 

687
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,269
share in the first video, and I just
forgot, I apologize, is there is a

688
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
forgot, I apologize, is there is a
 

689
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,990
forgot, I apologize, is there is a
passage in NPC core. Uh I forget the

690
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
passage in NPC core. Uh I forget the
 

691
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,430
passage in NPC core. Uh I forget the
page number, but I'll put it on the

692
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
page number, but I'll put it on the
 

693
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,990
page number, but I'll put it on the
screen somewhere for you, but there is a

694
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
screen somewhere for you, but there is a
 

695
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,750
screen somewhere for you, but there is a
special ability that is available to

696
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
special ability that is available to
 

697
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,470
special ability that is available to
troops called change formation. The I

698
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
troops called change formation. The I
 

699
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,710
troops called change formation. The I
believe the text says that this is not

700
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
believe the text says that this is not
 

701
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,949
believe the text says that this is not
um given by default to all troops of all

702
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:29,959
um given by default to all troops of all
 

703
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,829
um given by default to all troops of all
kinds. But if you have a military

704
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
kinds. But if you have a military
 

705
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,310
kinds. But if you have a military
focused troop like a failins, then they

706
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
focused troop like a failins, then they
 

707
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,710
focused troop like a failins, then they
might have other additional things they

708
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
might have other additional things they
 

709
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,389
might have other additional things they
can do with this change formation. So I

710
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
can do with this change formation. So I
 

711
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,470
can do with this change formation. So I
wanted to review these items with you.

712
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
wanted to review these items with you.
 

713
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,269
wanted to review these items with you.
So change formation uh costs two actions

714
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
So change formation uh costs two actions
 

715
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,430
So change formation uh costs two actions
and it says the troop reconfigures to

716
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
and it says the troop reconfigures to
 

717
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,509
and it says the troop reconfigures to
assume one of the formations below they

718
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
assume one of the formations below they
 

719
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,710
assume one of the formations below they
know. Using this action again ends any

720
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
know. Using this action again ends any
 

721
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,030
know. Using this action again ends any
previous formation and the troop can

722
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
previous formation and the troop can
 

723
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,269
previous formation and the troop can
also use this action to revert to its

724
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
also use this action to revert to its
 

725
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,990
also use this action to revert to its
default formation ending any benefits

726
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
default formation ending any benefits
 

727
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,389
default formation ending any benefits
and drawbacks. So it's going to take two

728
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
and drawbacks. So it's going to take two
 

729
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,829
and drawbacks. So it's going to take two
actions for the troop to change their

730
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
actions for the troop to change their
 

731
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,509
actions for the troop to change their
formation. And each of these formations

732
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
formation. And each of these formations
 

733
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,829
formation. And each of these formations
includes uh a benefit and a drawback. So

734
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
includes uh a benefit and a drawback. So
 

735
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,310
includes uh a benefit and a drawback. So
loose, when you do loose, members of the

736
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
loose, when you do loose, members of the
 

737
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,870
loose, when you do loose, members of the
troops fan out to cover more ground. The

738
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
troops fan out to cover more ground. The
 

739
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,030
troops fan out to cover more ground. The
benefit of this is that any weaknesses

740
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
benefit of this is that any weaknesses
 

741
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,189
benefit of this is that any weaknesses
that the troop has to area and splash

742
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
that the troop has to area and splash
 

743
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,030
that the troop has to area and splash
damage are no longer enforced, but the

744
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
damage are no longer enforced, but the
 

745
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,910
damage are no longer enforced, but the
enemy's saving throws against their uh

746
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
enemy's saving throws against their uh
 

747
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,150
enemy's saving throws against their uh
their damaging effects are one degree of

748
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
their damaging effects are one degree of
 

749
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,150
their damaging effects are one degree of
success better. So they they fan out.

750
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
success better. So they they fan out.
 

751
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,949
success better. So they they fan out.
They cannot be uh they do not suffer the

then uh the players who are going to be

against ranged attacks and reflex saves.
but the troop moves slower at a -10 ft

796
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
but the troop moves slower at a -10 ft
 

797
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,909
but the troop moves slower at a -10 ft
penalty to all the speeds. I can see the

798
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
penalty to all the speeds. I can see the
 

799
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,070
penalty to all the speeds. I can see the
this turtle shell probably being the

800
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
this turtle shell probably being the
 

801
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,390
this turtle shell probably being the
most common of these formations I would

802
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
most common of these formations I would
 

803
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,230
most common of these formations I would
probably use in my games. It makes a lot

804
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
probably use in my games. It makes a lot
 

805
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,150
probably use in my games. It makes a lot
of sense. It's very thematic and it's

806
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
of sense. It's very thematic and it's
 

807
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,110
of sense. It's very thematic and it's
frankly kind of cool. Uh then you have

808
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
frankly kind of cool. Uh then you have
 

809
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,750
frankly kind of cool. Uh then you have
the wedge formation. The troop aligns

810
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
the wedge formation. The troop aligns
 

811
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,630
the wedge formation. The troop aligns
itself behind a powerful commander. The

812
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
itself behind a powerful commander. The
 

813
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,029
itself behind a powerful commander. The
troop chooses an adjacent allied

814
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
troop chooses an adjacent allied
 

815
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,510
troop chooses an adjacent allied
creature without the troop trait to fall

816
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
creature without the troop trait to fall
 

817
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,870
creature without the troop trait to fall
in behind. Each time the chosen creature

818
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
in behind. Each time the chosen creature
 

819
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,590
in behind. Each time the chosen creature
strides, the troop follows as a free

820
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
strides, the troop follows as a free
 

821
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,230
strides, the troop follows as a free
action, striding to keep the chosen

822
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
action, striding to keep the chosen
 

823
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,029
action, striding to keep the chosen
creature adjacent. Drawback, the troop

824
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
creature adjacent. Drawback, the troop
 

825
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,510
creature adjacent. Drawback, the troop
loses some of their autonomy, their

826
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
loses some of their autonomy, their
 

827
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,990
loses some of their autonomy, their
slowed one, and cannot voluntarily move

828
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
slowed one, and cannot voluntarily move
 

829
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,070
slowed one, and cannot voluntarily move
away from their leader. So again,

830
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
away from their leader. So again,
 

831
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,549
away from their leader. So again,
another very thematic thing. You have

832
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
another very thematic thing. You have
 

833
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,590
another very thematic thing. You have
the leader, the commander of the army,

834
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
the leader, the commander of the army,
 

835
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,430
the leader, the commander of the army,
and they've got a formation of their

836
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
and they've got a formation of their
 

837
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,990
and they've got a formation of their
troops following behind them. And this

838
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
troops following behind them. And this
 

839
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,669
troops following behind them. And this
makes sense to me. they're losing

840
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
makes sense to me. they're losing
 

841
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,190
makes sense to me. they're losing
essentially one action on the troop's

842
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
essentially one action on the troop's
 

843
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,909
essentially one action on the troop's
turn be to be able to freely move with

844
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
turn be to be able to freely move with
 

845
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,590
turn be to be able to freely move with
their commander. Um, so pretty cool. So

846
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
their commander. Um, so pretty cool. So
 

847
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,750
their commander. Um, so pretty cool. So
again, uh, these are four special

848
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
again, uh, these are four special
 

849
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,669
again, uh, these are four special
effects that can be applied to some

850
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
effects that can be applied to some
 

851
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,230
effects that can be applied to some
troops if the GM decides that they are a

852
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
troops if the GM decides that they are a
 

853
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,110
troops if the GM decides that they are a
military focused troop and are available

854
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
military focused troop and are available
 

855
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,310
military focused troop and are available
through the change formation ability. So

856
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
through the change formation ability. So
 

857
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,430
through the change formation ability. So
that is it. I I hope I have cleared up

858
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
that is it. I I hope I have cleared up
 

859
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,750
that is it. I I hope I have cleared up
some of the the thoughts and potential

860
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
some of the the thoughts and potential
 

861
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,390
some of the the thoughts and potential
miscon misconceptions about troops in

862
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
miscon misconceptions about troops in
 

863
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,710
miscon misconceptions about troops in
this video. Uh I apologize if I've just
