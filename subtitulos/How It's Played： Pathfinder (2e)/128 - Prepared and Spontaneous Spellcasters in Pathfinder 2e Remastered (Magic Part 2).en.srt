In Pathfinder, spellcasters are limited

42
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
In Pathfinder, spellcasters are limited
 

43
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,830
In Pathfinder, spellcasters are limited
in the number of spells they can cast in

44
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
in the number of spells they can cast in
 

45
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,389
in the number of spells they can cast in
a single day, as well as the power of

46
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
a single day, as well as the power of
 

47
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,189
a single day, as well as the power of
those spells. This mechanic is dependent

48
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
those spells. This mechanic is dependent
 

49
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,910
those spells. This mechanic is dependent
on the character's spell slots, which

50
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
on the character's spell slots, which
 

51
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,630
on the character's spell slots, which
are dictated by their class and level.

52
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
are dictated by their class and level.

Using bards as an example, in their
class listing, we find this table. For

56
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
class listing, we find this table. For
 

57
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,789
class listing, we find this table. For
example, we see here that a thirdle bard

58
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
example, we see here that a thirdle bard
 

59
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,550
example, we see here that a thirdle bard
has three first rank spell slots and two

60
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
has three first rank spell slots and two
 

61
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,230
has three first rank spell slots and two
second rank spell slots. Cantrips are a

62
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
second rank spell slots. Cantrips are a
 

63
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,550
second rank spell slots. Cantrips are a
special kind of spell that do not use

64
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
special kind of spell that do not use
 

65
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,789
special kind of spell that do not use
spell slots, and we'll discuss those in

66
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
spell slots, and we'll discuss those in
 

67
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,510
spell slots, and we'll discuss those in
a future video. When a character casts a

68
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
a future video. When a character casts a
 

69
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,390
a future video. When a character casts a
spell, that spell consumes one of their

70
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
spell, that spell consumes one of their
 

71
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,429
spell, that spell consumes one of their
spell slots, which means this thirdle

72
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
spell slots, which means this thirdle
 

73
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,630
spell slots, which means this thirdle
bard can cast three first rank spells

74
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
bard can cast three first rank spells
 

75
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,270
bard can cast three first rank spells
and two second rank spells before

76
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
and two second rank spells before
 

77
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,990
and two second rank spells before
needing to rest. After a full night's

78
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
needing to rest. After a full night's
 

79
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,990
needing to rest. After a full night's
rest and time spent in the morning for

80
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
rest and time spent in the morning for
 

81
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,550
rest and time spent in the morning for
daily preparations, the caster is reset

82
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
daily preparations, the caster is reset
 

83
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,510
daily preparations, the caster is reset
to their daily aotment of spell slots.

84
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
to their daily aotment of spell slots.
 

85
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,149
to their daily aotment of spell slots.
The caster can also cast lower rank

86
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
The caster can also cast lower rank
 

87
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,469
The caster can also cast lower rank
spells using higher rank spell slots

88
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
spells using higher rank spell slots
 

89
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,389
spells using higher rank spell slots
through a process called heightening.

90
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
through a process called heightening.
 

91
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,630
through a process called heightening.
When you cast a spell using a spell slot

92
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
When you cast a spell using a spell slot
 

93
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,789
When you cast a spell using a spell slot
that is higher than that spell's listed

94
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
that is higher than that spell's listed
 

95
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,350
that is higher than that spell's listed
rank, the spell is heightened and is

96
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
rank, the spell is heightened and is
 

97
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,830
rank, the spell is heightened and is
cast at a rank equal to the spell slot

98
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
cast at a rank equal to the spell slot
 

99
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,550
cast at a rank equal to the spell slot
that was used. For example, fireball is

100
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
that was used. For example, fireball is
 

101
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,470
that was used. For example, fireball is
a third rank spell and deals 6d6 damage,

102
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
a third rank spell and deals 6d6 damage,
 

103
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,030
a third rank spell and deals 6d6 damage,
but it can be cast using any spell slot

104
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
but it can be cast using any spell slot
 

105
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,510
but it can be cast using any spell slot
that is third rank or higher. If a

106
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
that is third rank or higher. If a
 

107
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,670
that is third rank or higher. If a
fireball is cast using a fifth rank

108
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
fireball is cast using a fifth rank
 

109
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,710
fireball is cast using a fifth rank
spell slot, then it becomes a fifth rank

110
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
spell slot, then it becomes a fifth rank
 

111
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,589
spell slot, then it becomes a fifth rank
fireball spell. And we see an entry at

112
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
fireball spell. And we see an entry at
 

113
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,830
fireball spell. And we see an entry at
the bottom of the description that reads

114
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
the bottom of the description that reads
 

115
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,309
the bottom of the description that reads
heightened plus one, the damage

116
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
heightened plus one, the damage
 

117
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,750
heightened plus one, the damage
increases by 2d6. And what this means is

118
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
increases by 2d6. And what this means is
 

119
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,070
increases by 2d6. And what this means is
every time a fireball spell's rank is

120
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
every time a fireball spell's rank is
 

121
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,710
every time a fireball spell's rank is
increased by one, its damage increases

122
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
increased by one, its damage increases
 

123
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,309
increased by one, its damage increases
by 2d6. So a fifth rank fireball spell

124
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
by 2d6. So a fifth rank fireball spell
 

125
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,470
by 2d6. So a fifth rank fireball spell
would deal 10d6 damage. 66 at its normal

126
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
would deal 10d6 damage. 66 at its normal
 

127
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,110
would deal 10d6 damage. 66 at its normal
third rank, plus two more dice when it

128
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
third rank, plus two more dice when it
 

129
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,670
third rank, plus two more dice when it
is heightened to fourth rank and two

130
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
is heightened to fourth rank and two
 

131
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,509
is heightened to fourth rank and two
more dice when it is heightened once

132
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
more dice when it is heightened once
 

133
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,710
more dice when it is heightened once
more to fifth rank. That's pretty easy.

134
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
more to fifth rank. That's pretty easy.
 

135
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,710
more to fifth rank. That's pretty easy.
But let's look at something like acid

136
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
But let's look at something like acid
 

137
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,350
But let's look at something like acid
grip. This is a second rank spell that

138
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
grip. This is a second rank spell that
 

139
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,710
grip. This is a second rank spell that
deals 2d8 acid damage plus 1d6

140
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
deals 2d8 acid damage plus 1d6
 

141
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,830
deals 2d8 acid damage plus 1d6
persistent damage. And we see a notation

142
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
persistent damage. And we see a notation
 

143
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,252
persistent damage. And we see a notation
at the bottom that says heightened

144
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:11,262
at the bottom that says heightened
 

145
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:11,830
at the bottom that says heightened
[snorts]

146
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
[snorts]
 

147
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,869
[snorts]
plus two. The initial damage increases

148
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
plus two. The initial damage increases
 

149
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,149
plus two. The initial damage increases
by 2d8 and the persistent damage

150
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
by 2d8 and the persistent damage
 

151
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,070
by 2d8 and the persistent damage
increases by 1d6. Since it says plus two

152
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
increases by 1d6. Since it says plus two
 

153
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,630
increases by 1d6. Since it says plus two
here, this bonus damage applies every

154
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
here, this bonus damage applies every
 

155
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,710
here, this bonus damage applies every
time the spell is heightened by two

156
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
time the spell is heightened by two
 

157
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,390
time the spell is heightened by two
ranks. So if acid grip is cast using a

158
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
ranks. So if acid grip is cast using a
 

159
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,789
ranks. So if acid grip is cast using a
third rank spell slot, it becomes a

160
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
third rank spell slot, it becomes a
 

161
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,430
third rank spell slot, it becomes a
third rank spell, but there is no change

162
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
third rank spell, but there is no change
 

163
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,309
third rank spell, but there is no change
to damage. And if it is cast with a

164
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
to damage. And if it is cast with a
 

165
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,869
to damage. And if it is cast with a
fourth rank spell slot, it becomes a

166
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
fourth rank spell slot, it becomes a
 

167
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,710
fourth rank spell slot, it becomes a
fourth rank spell. Deals 48 acid damage

168
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
fourth rank spell. Deals 48 acid damage
 

169
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,309
fourth rank spell. Deals 48 acid damage
plus another 2d6 persistent acid damage

170
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
plus another 2d6 persistent acid damage
 

171
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,550
plus another 2d6 persistent acid damage
because the damage increases every time

172
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
because the damage increases every time
 

173
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,830
because the damage increases every time
it is heightened by two ranks. At sixth

174
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
it is heightened by two ranks. At sixth
 

175
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,670
it is heightened by two ranks. At sixth
rank, acid group deals 68 damage and 3d6

176
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
rank, acid group deals 68 damage and 3d6
 

177
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,710
rank, acid group deals 68 damage and 3d6
persistent damage and so on. And next,

178
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
persistent damage and so on. And next,
 

179
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,429
persistent damage and so on. And next,
let's look at a spell like bless. This

180
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
let's look at a spell like bless. This
 

181
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,149
let's look at a spell like bless. This
is a first rank spell and has no

182
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
is a first rank spell and has no
 

183
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,869
is a first rank spell and has no
heightened entry at the bottom. A common

184
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
heightened entry at the bottom. A common
 

185
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,869
heightened entry at the bottom. A common
misconception is that the lack of a

186
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
misconception is that the lack of a
 

187
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,270
misconception is that the lack of a
heightened entry means it cannot be

188
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
heightened entry means it cannot be
 

189
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,830
heightened entry means it cannot be
heightened, and that's not correct.

190
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
heightened, and that's not correct.
 

191
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,909
heightened, and that's not correct.
Spellcasters may have limits to what

192
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
Spellcasters may have limits to what
 

193
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,670
Spellcasters may have limits to what
spells they are able to heighten, which

194
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
spells they are able to heighten, which
 

195
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,789
spells they are able to heighten, which
we're going to talk about in just a

196
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
we're going to talk about in just a
 

197
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,270
we're going to talk about in just a
minute, but it is possible to heighten

198
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
minute, but it is possible to heighten
 

199
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,390
minute, but it is possible to heighten
any spell, not just those with a special

200
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
any spell, not just those with a special
 

201
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,710
any spell, not just those with a special
heightened entry in their description.

202
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
heightened entry in their description.
 

203
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,030
heightened entry in their description.
So, if you cast bless with a sixth

204
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
So, if you cast bless with a sixth
 

205
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,430
So, if you cast bless with a sixth
ranked spell slot, it becomes a sixth

206
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
ranked spell slot, it becomes a sixth
 

207
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,990
ranked spell slot, it becomes a sixth
rank bless spell. But why would you do

208
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
rank bless spell. But why would you do
 

209
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,990
rank bless spell. But why would you do
that if it doesn't gain any bonuses for

210
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
that if it doesn't gain any bonuses for
 

211
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,870
that if it doesn't gain any bonuses for
being cast with a higher rank slot? And

212
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
being cast with a higher rank slot? And
 

213
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,670
being cast with a higher rank slot? And
the answer to that is counteracting. I

214
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
the answer to that is counteracting. I
 

215
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,350
the answer to that is counteracting. I
have a whole other video on the topic

216
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
have a whole other video on the topic
 

217
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,430
have a whole other video on the topic
which I will link in the description, so

218
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
which I will link in the description, so
 

219
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,870
which I will link in the description, so
I'm not going to go too deep into it

220
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm not going to go too deep into it
 

221
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,310
I'm not going to go too deep into it
here, but the higher the spell rank, the

222
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
here, but the higher the spell rank, the
 

223
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,189
here, but the higher the spell rank, the
harder it is for someone to dispel it.

224
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
harder it is for someone to dispel it.
 

225
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,950
harder it is for someone to dispel it.
All spells can be counteracted by

226
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
All spells can be counteracted by
 

227
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,950
All spells can be counteracted by
certain things like dispel magic, but

228
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
certain things like dispel magic, but
 

229
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,430
certain things like dispel magic, but
bless in particular can also be

230
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
bless in particular can also be
 

231
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,390
bless in particular can also be
counteracted by the Bane spell. So, if a

232
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
counteracted by the Bane spell. So, if a
 

233
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,390
counteracted by the Bane spell. So, if a
caster wanted to be extra safe when

234
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
caster wanted to be extra safe when
 

235
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,710
caster wanted to be extra safe when
casting bliss to either aid their

236
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
casting bliss to either aid their
 

237
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,670
casting bliss to either aid their
friends or to counteract an enemy's bane

238
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
friends or to counteract an enemy's bane
 

239
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,830
friends or to counteract an enemy's bane
spell, they might heighten it by

240
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
spell, they might heighten it by
 

241
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,790
spell, they might heighten it by
spending a fourth rank spell slot. And

242
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
spending a fourth rank spell slot. And
 

243
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,189
spending a fourth rank spell slot. And
it would then face counteract checks at

244
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
it would then face counteract checks at
 

245
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,710
it would then face counteract checks at
fourth rank instead of first.

246
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
fourth rank instead of first.
 

247
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,670
fourth rank instead of first.
So, spell slots are used to cast spells.

248
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
So, spell slots are used to cast spells.
 

249
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,909
So, spell slots are used to cast spells.
And when a spell is cast using a slot

250
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
And when a spell is cast using a slot
 

251
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,230
And when a spell is cast using a slot
higher than it listed rank, it becomes

252
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
higher than it listed rank, it becomes
 

253
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,710
higher than it listed rank, it becomes
heightened to the same rank as the slot

254
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
heightened to the same rank as the slot
 

255
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,510
heightened to the same rank as the slot
that was used. But how these spell slots

256
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
that was used. But how these spell slots
 

257
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,990
that was used. But how these spell slots
are managed differs greatly between

258
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
are managed differs greatly between
 

259
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,790
are managed differs greatly between
prepared spellcasters and spontaneous

260
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
prepared spellcasters and spontaneous
 

261
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,310
prepared spellcasters and spontaneous
spellcasters.

262
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
spellcasters.
 

263
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,310
spellcasters.
Spellcasters and Pathfinder fall into

one of those categories which is
determined by their class. Prepared

the name implies, prepared spellcasters

274
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
the name implies, prepared spellcasters
 

275
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,629
the name implies, prepared spellcasters
must plan their spells ahead of time. As

must plan their spells ahead of time. As
 

277

must plan their spells ahead of time. As
part of their daily preparations, they

part of their daily preparations, they
 

279

part of their daily preparations, they
must decide exactly how each spell slot

must decide exactly how each spell slot
 

281
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,710
must decide exactly how each spell slot
will be used in advance. For example, a

282
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
will be used in advance. For example, a
 

283
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,670

fifth level wizard has three first rank

284

worth mentioning that some features or

prepared for another one. Those are
 

339
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,790
prepared for another one. Those are
special circumstances. And for our

spontaneous spellcasters get to choose

362
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
spontaneous spellcasters get to choose
 

363
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,830
spontaneous spellcasters get to choose
which spell they're using a spell slot

364
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
which spell they're using a spell slot
 

365
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,469
which spell they're using a spell slot
for at the moment they cast it. This

366
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
for at the moment they cast it. This
 

367
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,029
for at the moment they cast it. This
grants spontaneous spellcasters a lot of

368
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
grants spontaneous spellcasters a lot of
 

369
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,869
grants spontaneous spellcasters a lot of
freedom in how they choose to spend

370
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
freedom in how they choose to spend
 

371
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,430
freedom in how they choose to spend
their spell slots, but there are a

372
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
their spell slots, but there are a
 

373
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,309
their spell slots, but there are a
couple important limitations. First,

374
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
couple important limitations. First,
 

375
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,029
couple important limitations. First,
spontaneous casters are much more

376
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
spontaneous casters are much more
 

377
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,510
spontaneous casters are much more
limited in the variety of spells they

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
limited in the variety of spells they
 

379
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,589
limited in the variety of spells they
can cast. For example, a first level

380
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
can cast. For example, a first level
 

381
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,309
can cast. For example, a first level
bard has two spell slots and knows how

382
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
bard has two spell slots and knows how
 

383

to cast two spells, ignoring their
 

385
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,350
to cast two spells, ignoring their
cantrips. They don't have to decide in

386
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
cantrips. They don't have to decide in
 

387
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,189
cantrips. They don't have to decide in
advance if they want to cast each of

00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
advance if they want to cast each of
 

389
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,830
advance if they want to cast each of
those spells once per day or cast the

390
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
those spells once per day or cast the
 

391
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,309
those spells once per day or cast the
same spell twice, but they're still

392
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
same spell twice, but they're still
 

393
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,189
same spell twice, but they're still
limited to just those two spells. A

394
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
limited to just those two spells. A
 

395
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,110

first level wizard, on the other hand,
also starts with two spell slots, but

to choose in advance how those two spell

to choose in advance how those two spell
 

403
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,790
to choose in advance how those two spell
slots will be used each day, but they

to choose from. And the second big
 

409

limitation is how spontaneous casters

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
limitation is how spontaneous casters
 

411
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,990
limitation is how spontaneous casters
handle heightened spells. Prepared

they automatically know how to cast
 

483
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,750
they automatically know how to cast
every other rank of heal, too. One very

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
every other rank of heal, too. One very

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,230
every other rank of heal, too. One very
important exception to this is signature

486
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
important exception to this is signature
 

487
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,350
important exception to this is signature
spells. Spontaneous casters can gain

488
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
spells. Spontaneous casters can gain
 

489
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,069
spells. Spontaneous casters can gain
signature spells as they level up. When

490
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
signature spells as they level up. When
 

491
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,310
signature spells as they level up. When
a spell is designated as a signature

492
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
a spell is designated as a signature
 

493
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,870
a spell is designated as a signature
spell, spontaneous casters can freely

494
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
spell, spontaneous casters can freely
 

495
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,710
spell, spontaneous casters can freely
heighten it the same as a prepared

496
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
heighten it the same as a prepared
 

497
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,590
heighten it the same as a prepared
caster. So, if the angelic sorcerer in

498
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
caster. So, if the angelic sorcerer in
 

499
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,910
caster. So, if the angelic sorcerer in
the previous example took heal as one of

500
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
the previous example took heal as one of
 

501
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,389
the previous example took heal as one of
their signature spells, then it would

502
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
their signature spells, then it would
 

503
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,030
their signature spells, then it would
only occupy one of their known spells,

504
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
only occupy one of their known spells,
 

505
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,949
only occupy one of their known spells,
and they would be able to heighten it to

506
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
and they would be able to heighten it to
 

507
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,910
and they would be able to heighten it to
cast at any rank. Spontaneous casters

508
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
cast at any rank. Spontaneous casters
 

509
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,230
cast at any rank. Spontaneous casters
can also cast a spell using a higher

510
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
can also cast a spell using a higher
 

511
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,190
can also cast a spell using a higher
rank spell slot without heightening it.

512
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
rank spell slot without heightening it.
 

513
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,750
rank spell slot without heightening it.
For example, a sorcerer knows the first

514
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
For example, a sorcerer knows the first
 

515
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,389
For example, a sorcerer knows the first
rank and third rank versions of Breathe

516
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
rank and third rank versions of Breathe
 

517
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,750
rank and third rank versions of Breathe
Fire, but not the second rank version.

518
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
Fire, but not the second rank version.
 

519
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,910
Fire, but not the second rank version.
This sorcerer could cast Breathe Fire

520
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
This sorcerer could cast Breathe Fire
 

521
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,389
This sorcerer could cast Breathe Fire
using a second rank spell slot, but it

522
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
using a second rank spell slot, but it
 

523
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,150
using a second rank spell slot, but it
wouldn't function any differently than

524
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
wouldn't function any differently than
 

525
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,870
wouldn't function any differently than
the normal first rank spell. This is

526
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
the normal first rank spell. This is
 

527
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,949
the normal first rank spell. This is
different from prepared spellcasters who

528
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
different from prepared spellcasters who
 

529
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,710
different from prepared spellcasters who
automatically heighten all their spells

530
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
automatically heighten all their spells
 

531
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,550
automatically heighten all their spells
to the rank of the spell slot that's

532
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
to the rank of the spell slot that's
 

533
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,269
to the rank of the spell slot that's
being used to cast it.

534
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
being used to cast it.
 

535
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,350
being used to cast it.
That's how prepared and spontaneous

536
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
That's how prepared and spontaneous
 

537
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,350
That's how prepared and spontaneous
spellcasters work in general. But

538
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
spellcasters work in general. But
 

539
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,750
spellcasters work in general. But
there's one more thing to consider. In

540
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
there's one more thing to consider. In
 

541
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,670
there's one more thing to consider. In
my experience GMing Pathfinder,

542
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
my experience GMing Pathfinder,
 

543
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,590
my experience GMing Pathfinder,
something I commonly encounter from new

544
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
something I commonly encounter from new
 

545
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,509
something I commonly encounter from new
players is their desire to play a

546
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
players is their desire to play a
 

547
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,230
players is their desire to play a
prepared spell-casting class using the

548
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
prepared spell-casting class using the
 

549
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,190
prepared spell-casting class using the
spontaneous spell-casting rules. This is

550
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
spontaneous spell-casting rules. This is
 

551
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,350
spontaneous spell-casting rules. This is
especially common amongst players coming

552
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
especially common amongst players coming
 

553
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,069
especially common amongst players coming

good news is that there is a way to

good news is that there is a way to

good news is that there is a way to
accommodate these players within the

accommodate these players within the

preparations, these spellcasters create

578
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
preparations, these spellcasters create
 

579
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,750
preparations, these spellcasters create
a collection of spells. And then during

580
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
a collection of spells. And then during
 

581
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,430
a collection of spells. And then during
the adventuring day, they can cast

582
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
the adventuring day, they can cast
 

583
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,590
the adventuring day, they can cast
spells from this collection the same as

584
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
spells from this collection the same as
 

585
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,310
spells from this collection the same as
a spontaneous cer where they choose the

586
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
a spontaneous cer where they choose the
 

587
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,629
a spontaneous cer where they choose the
spell and the spell slot at the moment

spell and the spell slot at the moment
 

589
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,670
spell and the spell slot at the moment
it is cast. There are however a couple

590
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
it is cast. There are however a couple
 

591
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,509
it is cast. There are however a couple
downsides to this in addition to

592
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
downsides to this in addition to
 

593
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,350
downsides to this in addition to
sacrificing the character's second level

594
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
sacrificing the character's second level
 

595
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,590
sacrificing the character's second level
spell feat. The main downside is

596
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
spell feat. The main downside is
 

597
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,670
spell feat. The main downside is
flexible spellcasters use a different

598
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
flexible spellcasters use a different
 

599
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,069
flexible spellcasters use a different
spells per day table than their classes

600
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
spells per day table than their classes
 

601
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,470
spells per day table than their classes
spells per day table. And the key

602
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
spells per day table. And the key
 

603
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,550
spells per day table. And the key
difference here is flexible spellcasters

604
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
difference here is flexible spellcasters
 

605
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,750
difference here is flexible spellcasters
have fewer spells per rank, maxing at

606
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
have fewer spells per rank, maxing at
 

607
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,870
have fewer spells per rank, maxing at
two instead of three. So basically the

608
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
two instead of three. So basically the
 

609
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,629
two instead of three. So basically the
main benefit of this archetype is the

610
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
main benefit of this archetype is the
 

611
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,629
main benefit of this archetype is the
ability to cast spells spontaneously and

612
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
ability to cast spells spontaneously and
 

613
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,110
ability to cast spells spontaneously and
the main drawback is fewer spells per

614
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
the main drawback is fewer spells per
 

615
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,670
the main drawback is fewer spells per
day. I should also mention that any

616
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
day. I should also mention that any
 

617
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,750
day. I should also mention that any
players interested in this archetype

618
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
players interested in this archetype
 

619
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,389
players interested in this archetype
should discuss it with their GM first as

620
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
should discuss it with their GM first as
 

621
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,509
should discuss it with their GM first as
it is not a core archetype, meaning they

622
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
it is not a core archetype, meaning they
 

623
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,509
it is not a core archetype, meaning they
should not assume that it is allowed in

624
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
should not assume that it is allowed in
 

625
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,750
should not assume that it is allowed in
every game.

626
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
every game.
 

627
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,990
every game.
