Skirmish encounters revolve around troop

00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
Skirmish encounters revolve around troop
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,950
Skirmish encounters revolve around troop
combat. So it's highly recommended that

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
combat. So it's highly recommended that
 

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,950
combat. So it's highly recommended that
you watch my video on troops if you

10
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
you watch my video on troops if you

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,190
you watch my video on troops if you
haven't already as those rules are

haven't already as those rules are
necessary to understanding skirmishes

necessary to understanding skirmishes
 

15
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,750
necessary to understanding skirmishes
and I will not be covering all of the

troop rules in detail again here.
Skirmish encounters allow players to

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
Skirmish encounters allow players to
 

21
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,790
Skirmish encounters allow players to
take part in larger battles with dozens

22
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
take part in larger battles with dozens
 

23
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,870
take part in larger battles with dozens
or more combatants on each side of the

conflict without sacrificing their sense
 

27
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,470
conflict without sacrificing their sense
of individuality at the game table. This

system where the players look down on
the battlefield from a bird's eyee view

34
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
the battlefield from a bird's eyee view
 

35
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,630
the battlefield from a bird's eyee view
above, but instead puts them on the

00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
above, but instead puts them on the
 

37
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,029

battlefield itself and in command of
 

39
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,750
battlefield itself and in command of
troops. Simply put, troops are large

40
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
troops. Simply put, troops are large
 

41
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,150
troops. Simply put, troops are large
groups of creatures that work together.

42
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
groups of creatures that work together.
 

43
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,470
groups of creatures that work together.
Although a troop is made up of lots of

44
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
Although a troop is made up of lots of
 

45
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,790
Although a troop is made up of lots of
smaller individuals, it mechanically

46
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
smaller individuals, it mechanically
 

47
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,349
smaller individuals, it mechanically
functions as a single large creature

48
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
functions as a single large creature
 

49
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,990
functions as a single large creature
with one stat block, sort of like a

50
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
with one stat block, sort of like a
 

51
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,630
with one stat block, sort of like a
swarm, but usually made of larger, more

52
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
swarm, but usually made of larger, more
 

53
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,950
swarm, but usually made of larger, more
intelligent creatures. In a typical

54
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
intelligent creatures. In a typical
 

55
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,950
intelligent creatures. In a typical
skirmish encounter, each player is

56
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
skirmish encounter, each player is
 

57
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,270
skirmish encounter, each player is
placed in command of their own troop.

58
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
placed in command of their own troop.
 

59
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,270
placed in command of their own troop.
So, if you have four players, you will

60
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
So, if you have four players, you will
 

61
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,630
So, if you have four players, you will
likely also have four troops, each one

62
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
likely also have four troops, each one
 

63
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,870
likely also have four troops, each one
controlled by a different player. And

64
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
controlled by a different player. And
 

65
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,030
controlled by a different player. And
not just mechanically speaking, within

66
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
not just mechanically speaking, within
 

67
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,030
not just mechanically speaking, within
the narrative, each player's character

68
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
the narrative, each player's character
 

69
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,270
the narrative, each player's character
has command of their own troop with the

70
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
has command of their own troop with the
 

71
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,950
has command of their own troop with the
members of that troop following their

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
members of that troop following their
 

73
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,590
members of that troop following their
orders. Establishing leadership of a

74
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
orders. Establishing leadership of a
 

75
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,149
orders. Establishing leadership of a
troop takes at least 10 minutes. And if

76
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
troop takes at least 10 minutes. And if
 

77
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,990
troop takes at least 10 minutes. And if
they spend a full day of downtime

78
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
they spend a full day of downtime
 

79
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,310
they spend a full day of downtime
together, they form a special skirmish

80
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
together, they form a special skirmish
 

81
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,230
together, they form a special skirmish
bond, which we'll talk about a little

82
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
bond, which we'll talk about a little
 

83
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,310
bond, which we'll talk about a little
bit later.

84
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
bit later.
 

85
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,310
bit later.
The skirmish encounter rules are

86
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
The skirmish encounter rules are
 

87
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,030
The skirmish encounter rules are
abstracted to a larger degree than the

88
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
abstracted to a larger degree than the
 

89
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,830
abstracted to a larger degree than the
usual combat rules, but function in much

90
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
usual combat rules, but function in much
 

91
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,230
usual combat rules, but function in much
the same way. When commanding a troop,

92
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
the same way. When commanding a troop,
 

93
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,469
the same way. When commanding a troop,
the player and the troop they command

94
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
the player and the troop they command
 

95
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,190
the player and the troop they command
combined together. The player character

96
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
combined together. The player character
 

97
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,910
combined together. The player character
is treated as if they are occupying all

98
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
is treated as if they are occupying all
 

99
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,310
is treated as if they are occupying all
of the troops spaces and segments

100
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
of the troops spaces and segments
 

101
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,789
of the troops spaces and segments
simultaneously. They can make attacks,

102
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
simultaneously. They can make attacks,
 

103
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,190
simultaneously. They can make attacks,
calculate range, determine cover, and so

104
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
calculate range, determine cover, and so
 

105
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,910
calculate range, determine cover, and so
on from any single space within the

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
on from any single space within the
 

107
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,430
on from any single space within the
troops area.

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
troops area.
 

109
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,270
troops area.
They need to choose which space they are

110
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
They need to choose which space they are
 

111
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,750
They need to choose which space they are
in to take an action like strike, but

112
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
in to take an action like strike, but
 

113
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,910
in to take an action like strike, but
they are only locked into that space for

114
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
they are only locked into that space for
 

115
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,190
they are only locked into that space for
the purposes of that one action. For

116
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
the purposes of that one action. For
 

117
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,110
the purposes of that one action. For
example, a troop's leader can spin an

118
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
example, a troop's leader can spin an
 

119
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,190
example, a troop's leader can spin an
action to make an attack from one space

120
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
action to make an attack from one space
 

121
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,510
action to make an attack from one space
within a troop's area and then spin

122
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
within a troop's area and then spin
 

123
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,830
within a troop's area and then spin
their next action to make another attack

124
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
their next action to make another attack
 

125
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,830
their next action to make another attack
from a square on the other side of the

126
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
from a square on the other side of the

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,030
the troop spaces.
Together, the PC leader and their troop

140
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
Together, the PC leader and their troop
 

141
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,309
Together, the PC leader and their troop
get five actions and two reactions each

142
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
get five actions and two reactions each
 

143
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,670
get five actions and two reactions each
round, which are divided into two sets.

144
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
round, which are divided into two sets.
 

145
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,509
round, which are divided into two sets.
One set has three actions and one

146
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
One set has three actions and one
 

147
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,670
One set has three actions and one
reaction, and the other set has two

148
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
reaction, and the other set has two
 

149
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,470
reaction, and the other set has two
actions and one reaction. Each turn, the

150
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
actions and one reaction. Each turn, the
 

151
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,550
actions and one reaction. Each turn, the
player decides how to allocate these

152
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
player decides how to allocate these
 

153
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,270
player decides how to allocate these
sets between the troop and its leader.

154
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
sets between the troop and its leader.
 

155
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,270
sets between the troop and its leader.
So, one round, the leader might have

156
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
So, one round, the leader might have
 

157
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,830
So, one round, the leader might have
three actions and the troop two actions,

158
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
three actions and the troop two actions,
 

159
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,589
three actions and the troop two actions,
and the next round the troop might have

160
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
and the next round the troop might have
 

161
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,990
and the next round the troop might have
three actions and the leader too.

162
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
three actions and the leader too.
 

163
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,830
three actions and the leader too.
Regardless, the leader and the troop

164
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
Regardless, the leader and the troop
 

165
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,710
Regardless, the leader and the troop
will always have one reaction of their

166
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
will always have one reaction of their
 

167
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,589
will always have one reaction of their
own. Any effect that adjusts the

168
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
own. Any effect that adjusts the
 

169
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,990
own. Any effect that adjusts the
creature's number of actions is applied

170
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
creature's number of actions is applied
 

171
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,470
creature's number of actions is applied
separately. For example, if a leader and

172
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
separately. For example, if a leader and
 

173
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,070
separately. For example, if a leader and
the troop are both subject to the

174
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
the troop are both subject to the
 

175
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,869
the troop are both subject to the
quickened condition, they each gain an

176
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
quickened condition, they each gain an
 

177
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,190
quickened condition, they each gain an
extra action. And the same would apply

178
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
extra action. And the same would apply
 

179
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,589
extra action. And the same would apply
if they are both slowed. They would each

180
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
if they are both slowed. They would each
 

181
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,550
if they are both slowed. They would each
lose an action.

182
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
lose an action.
 

183
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,589
lose an action.
Any move action a troop or leader takes

184
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
Any move action a troop or leader takes
 

185
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,550
Any move action a troop or leader takes
moves the entire unit. If the leader

186
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
moves the entire unit. If the leader
 

187
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,550
moves the entire unit. If the leader
spins an action to stride, then the

188
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
spins an action to stride, then the
 

189
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,190
spins an action to stride, then the
entire group moves even if the leader

190
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
entire group moves even if the leader
 

191
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,910
entire group moves even if the leader
speed score is higher than the troops.

192
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
speed score is higher than the troops.
 

193
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,990
speed score is higher than the troops.
And the same is true if the troop spins

194
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
And the same is true if the troop spins
 

195
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,550
And the same is true if the troop spins
an action to stride. It would move up to

196
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
an action to stride. It would move up to
 

197
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,390
an action to stride. It would move up to
its speed score and the leader would

198
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
its speed score and the leader would
 

199
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,390
its speed score and the leader would
move along with it. Again, because the

200
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
move along with it. Again, because the
 

201
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,309
move along with it. Again, because the
leader is occupying all of its same

202
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
leader is occupying all of its same
 

203
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,190
leader is occupying all of its same
spaces simultaneously. That said, the GM

204
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
spaces simultaneously. That said, the GM
 

205
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,110
spaces simultaneously. That said, the GM
is expected to manage this if the

206
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
is expected to manage this if the
 

207
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,429
is expected to manage this if the
differences in speed are great or the

208
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
differences in speed are great or the
 

209
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,589
differences in speed are great or the
leader has a mode of movement that the

210
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
leader has a mode of movement that the
 

211
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,390
leader has a mode of movement that the
troop doesn't, such as flight. And to

212
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
troop doesn't, such as flight. And to
 

213
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,509
troop doesn't, such as flight. And to
keep movement somewhat in check, no more

214
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
keep movement somewhat in check, no more
 

215
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,909
keep movement somewhat in check, no more
than three actions worth of their five

216
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
than three actions worth of their five
 

217
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,870
than three actions worth of their five
actions can be used to move the group in

218
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
actions can be used to move the group in
 

219
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,350
actions can be used to move the group in
one turn. This includes both move

220
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
one turn. This includes both move
 

221
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,070
one turn. This includes both move
actions like stride and activities that

222
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
actions like stride and activities that
 

223
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,189
actions like stride and activities that
include move actions. For example, if a

224
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
include move actions. For example, if a
 

225
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,430
include move actions. For example, if a
troop was led by a barbarian and that

226
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
troop was led by a barbarian and that
 

227
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,310
troop was led by a barbarian and that
leader used sudden charge, which doesn't

228
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
leader used sudden charge, which doesn't
 

229
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,310
leader used sudden charge, which doesn't
include the move trait itself, but does

230
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
include the move trait itself, but does
 

231
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,710
include the move trait itself, but does
cause the user to strike twice, the

232
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
cause the user to strike twice, the
 

233
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,030
cause the user to strike twice, the
group could only use one more action to

234
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
group could only use one more action to
 

235
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,430
group could only use one more action to
move during their turn. But that one

236
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
move during their turn. But that one
 

237
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,030
move during their turn. But that one
action could come from either the

238
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
action could come from either the
 

239
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,909
action could come from either the
barbarian leader or from their troop.

240
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
barbarian leader or from their troop.
 

241
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,310
barbarian leader or from their troop.
And if an ability lets the troop and its

242
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
And if an ability lets the troop and its
 

243
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,790
And if an ability lets the troop and its
leader move outside of their turn, the

244
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
leader move outside of their turn, the
 

245
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,749
leader move outside of their turn, the
unit can usually move only once. For

246
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
unit can usually move only once. For
 

247
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,990
unit can usually move only once. For
example, if they move because of a

248
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
example, if they move because of a
 

249
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,230
example, if they move because of a
reaction or because of a commander's

250
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
reaction or because of a commander's
 

251
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,390
reaction or because of a commander's
tactic that lets several squadmates

tactic that lets several squadmates
 

253
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,790
tactic that lets several squadmates
move, the leader in the troop could only

254
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
move, the leader in the troop could only
 

255
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,350
move, the leader in the troop could only
benefit from this one time because they

256
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
benefit from this one time because they
 

257
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,629
benefit from this one time because they
are one unit. And another note related

258
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
are one unit. And another note related
 

259
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,870
are one unit. And another note related
to movement. If a skirmish encounter

260
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
to movement. If a skirmish encounter
 

261
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,110
to movement. If a skirmish encounter
begins unexpectedly, for example, if the

262
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
begins unexpectedly, for example, if the
 

263
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,029
begins unexpectedly, for example, if the
players are taken by surprise, the

264
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
players are taken by surprise, the
 

265
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,430
players are taken by surprise, the
leader is automatically moved to their

leader is automatically moved to their
 

267
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,230
leader is automatically moved to their

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
As mentioned earlier, if a leader spends
 

271
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,710
As mentioned earlier, if a leader spends
a full day of downtime working with and

a full day of downtime working with and
 

273
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,870
a full day of downtime working with and
drilling with their troop, they can form

274
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
drilling with their troop, they can form
 

275
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,590
drilling with their troop, they can form
a special bond. After one day of

276
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
a special bond. After one day of
 

277
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,590
a special bond. After one day of
downtime, the leader can select one

278
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
downtime, the leader can select one
 

279
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,189

bond to a new one after another day of
 

285
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,390
bond to a new one after another day of
downtime. For example, a leader who has

286
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
downtime. For example, a leader who has
 

287
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,710
downtime. For example, a leader who has
expert proficiency with a weapon could

288
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
expert proficiency with a weapon could
 

289
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,749
expert proficiency with a weapon could
select the combo attack bond. If they're

select the combo attack bond. If they're
 

291
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,550
select the combo attack bond. If they're
leading a Goblin Rabble troop, then any

bond available to them called under
 

313
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,710
bond available to them called under
command. This allows the commander to

314
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
command. This allows the commander to
 

315
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,230
command. This allows the commander to
treat the troop as one of their

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,309
targets a single creature, for example,
most melee attacks, the attacker chooses

330
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
most melee attacks, the attacker chooses
 

331
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,790
most melee attacks, the attacker chooses
if they wish to target the troop or the

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,110
if they wish to target the troop or the
player character leading the troop and

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
player character leading the troop and
 

335
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,309
player character leading the troop and
then resolves the effect as normal. And

336
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
then resolves the effect as normal. And
 

337
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,390
then resolves the effect as normal. And
again, the leader is considered to be

338
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
again, the leader is considered to be
 

339
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,790
again, the leader is considered to be
occupying all the same spaces as the

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
occupying all the same spaces as the
 

341
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,189

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
So all the enemy needs to be able to do
 

345
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,550
So all the enemy needs to be able to do
is target any one of the troop spaces,

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
leader attacks. And this includes
 

363
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,909

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
situations where the leader is mounted
 

365
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,710
situations where the leader is mounted

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
troop's leader does. This can be
 

391
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,350
troop's leader does. This can be
dangerous for weaker minions, especially

dangerous for weaker minions, especially
 

393
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,150
dangerous for weaker minions, especially
familiars, but can be offset with the

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
In skirmish encounters, troops can be
 

399
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,270
In skirmish encounters, troops can be
forced to flee from battle if their

forced to flee from battle if their
 

401
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,070
forced to flee from battle if their
morale drops too low. This is managed

402
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
morale drops too low. This is managed
 

403
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,469
morale drops too low. This is managed
through route checks, which is a type of

00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
willsaving throw. Route checks are
 

407
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,869
willsaving throw. Route checks are
rolled whenever the troop's hit points

408
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
rolled whenever the troop's hit points
 

409
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,189
rolled whenever the troop's hit points
are pushed past one of his thresholds

are pushed past one of his thresholds
 

411
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,029
are pushed past one of his thresholds
and whenever the troop's leader is

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
knocked unconscious. If both happen at
 

415
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,550
knocked unconscious. If both happen at
the same time, the troop only rolls one

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
the same time, the troop only rolls one
 

417
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,350
the same time, the troop only rolls one
route check. Route checks have the

418
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
route check. Route checks have the
 

419
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,990
route check. Route checks have the
emotion, fear, and mental traits. And

emotion, fear, and mental traits. And
 

421
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,029
emotion, fear, and mental traits. And
the DC for route checks is a standard DC

422
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
the DC for route checks is a standard DC
 

423
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,790
the DC for route checks is a standard DC
for the level of the creature who

00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
damaged it. With a successful will save,
 

427
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,909
damaged it. With a successful will save,
the troop is frightened one. On a

428
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
the troop is frightened one. On a
 

429
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,149
the troop is frightened one. On a
failure, the troop is frightened too.

430
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
failure, the troop is frightened too.
 

431
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,710
failure, the troop is frightened too.
And on a critical failure, the members

away, causing the entire troop to be
 

437
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,670
away, causing the entire troop to be
removed from battle. The result of a

route check applies only to the troop
 

441
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,910
route check applies only to the troop
and not its leader. And while the

00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
troop's leader is conscious, the result
 

445
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,630
troop's leader is conscious, the result
of this check is improved by one step.

446
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
of this check is improved by one step.
 

447
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,790
of this check is improved by one step.
When a leader's troop is defeated, the

448
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
When a leader's troop is defeated, the
 

449
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,949
When a leader's troop is defeated, the
leader is placed into any space the

continues as normal. When a troop flees,
 

455
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,910
continues as normal. When a troop flees,
the leader may choose to flee with them

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
the leader may choose to flee with them
 

457
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,269
the leader may choose to flee with them
or abandon them to stay and fight. If

or abandon them to stay and fight. If
 

459
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,509
or abandon them to stay and fight. If
the leader abandons their fleeing troop,

460
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
the leader abandons their fleeing troop,
 

461
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,190
the leader abandons their fleeing troop,
they cannot become the leader of that

462

they cannot become the leader of that
 

463
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,910
they cannot become the leader of that
troop again within the same encounter.

And if the troop loses their leader,
 

467
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,910
And if the troop loses their leader,
either because the leader is knocked out
