00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
well let's look at a more specific
 

281
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,510
well let's look at a more specific
example Kirra is a cleric of sarra and

282
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
example Kirra is a cleric of sarra and
 

283
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,710
example Kirra is a cleric of sarra and
is Sanctified as holy therefore she has

284
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
is Sanctified as holy therefore she has

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
the holy trck
 

287
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,390
the holy trck
she attacks a goblin warrior with Divine

she attacks a goblin warrior with Divine
 

289
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,950
she attacks a goblin warrior with Divine
Lance because Divine Lance has the

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:42,520
trait making it a holy Divine Lance so
 

295
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,589
trait making it a holy Divine Lance so
to speak if she hits the goblin with her

296
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:45,599
to speak if she hits the goblin with her
 

297
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,990
to speak if she hits the goblin with her
holy Divine Lance it will suffer 2 D4

00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:51,319
Spirit damage just like most anything
 

301
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,430
Spirit damage just like most anything
else the goblin is not weak to Holy and

302
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
else the goblin is not weak to Holy and
 

303
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,189
else the goblin is not weak to Holy and
there is nothing else here that

304
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
there is nothing else here that
 

305
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,350
there is nothing else here that
interacts with the Holy trait so Kyra

306
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,360
interacts with the Holy trait so Kyra
 

307
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,029
interacts with the Holy trait so Kyra
being holy makes no difference in this

308
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
being holy makes no difference in this
 

309
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,790
being holy makes no difference in this
example her Divine Lance functions the

310
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:05,800
example her Divine Lance functions the
 

311
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,390
example her Divine Lance functions the
same as any other Divine casters when

312
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
same as any other Divine casters when
 

313
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,270
same as any other Divine casters when
attacking this

314
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,280
attacking this
 

315
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,629
attacking this
Goblin next let's consider what happens

316
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
Goblin next let's consider what happens
 

317
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,390
Goblin next let's consider what happens
when Kyra casts Divine Lance at a bar

318
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,400
when Kyra casts Divine Lance at a bar
 

319
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,589
when Kyra casts Divine Lance at a bar
guest we see here that bargus have the

320
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:18,599
guest we see here that bargus have the
 

321
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,110
guest we see here that bargus have the
Unholy trait and weakness five to Holy

322
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
Unholy trait and weakness five to Holy
 

323
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,110
Unholy trait and weakness five to Holy
therefore if Kyra hits it with her

324
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
therefore if Kyra hits it with her
 

325
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,390
therefore if Kyra hits it with her
Divine Lance she will trigger its

326
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,400
Divine Lance she will trigger its
 

327
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,350
Divine Lance she will trigger its
weakness and deal an extra five damage

328
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,360
weakness and deal an extra five damage
 

329
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,469
weakness and deal an extra five damage
for a total of 2 D4 + 5 Spirit

330
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
for a total of 2 D4 + 5 Spirit
 

331
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,670
for a total of 2 D4 + 5 Spirit
damage and now let's look at what

332
