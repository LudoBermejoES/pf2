can only manifest within that listed
 

15
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,470
can only manifest within that listed
space. A spell with a range of touch

16
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
space. A spell with a range of touch
 

17
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,390
space. A spell with a range of touch
requires the caster to touch the target

18
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
requires the caster to touch the target
 

19
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,470
requires the caster to touch the target
with some part of their hand, even if

20
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
with some part of their hand, even if
 

21
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,790
with some part of their hand, even if
that hand is covered in a glove or

22
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
that hand is covered in a glove or
 

23
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,029
that hand is covered in a glove or
holding something. So, the spell's range

24
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
holding something. So, the spell's range
 

25
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,189
holding something. So, the spell's range
is usually the same as their unarmed

26
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
is usually the same as their unarmed
 

27
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,990
is usually the same as their unarmed
attack range, 5T for small and medium

The act of touching itself does not
require any rolls, but the spells often

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
require any rolls, but the spells often
 

37
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,750
require any rolls, but the spells often
allow the target to make a save or

38
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
allow the target to make a save or
 

39
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,590
allow the target to make a save or

attack roll.
The range might also be listed as an

44
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
The range might also be listed as an
 

45
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,310
The range might also be listed as an
area such as a burst, cone, imination,

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,350
area such as a burst, cone, imination,
or line. Note that for each of these, I

48
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
or line. Note that for each of these, I
 

49
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,349
or line. Note that for each of these, I
will provide some explanation for how to

50
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
will provide some explanation for how to
 

51
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,910
will provide some explanation for how to
draw the area yourself. But remember,

52
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
draw the area yourself. But remember,
 

53
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,990
draw the area yourself. But remember,
you can always use the templates found

54
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
you can always use the templates found
 

55
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,030
you can always use the templates found
on page 429 of player core 1 if that's

56
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
on page 429 of player core 1 if that's
 

57
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,109
on page 429 of player core 1 if that's
easier. When casting a spell with a

58
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
easier. When casting a spell with a
 

59
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,350
easier. When casting a spell with a
burst area, you select an intersection

60
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
burst area, you select an intersection
 

61
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,429
burst area, you select an intersection
of squares within the spell's listed

62
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
of squares within the spell's listed
 

63
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,910
of squares within the spell's listed
range and then draw a number of feet

64
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
range and then draw a number of feet
 

65
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,870
range and then draw a number of feet
away from that point in all directions.

66
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
away from that point in all directions.
 

67
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,710
away from that point in all directions.
So, a 5-ft burst is the same as a 2x two

68
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
So, a 5-ft burst is the same as a 2x two
 

69
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,670
So, a 5-ft burst is the same as a 2x two
square area. And a 10-ft burst would

70
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
square area. And a 10-ft burst would
 

71
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,910
square area. And a 10-ft burst would
look like this. You select an

72
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
look like this. You select an
 

73
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,310
look like this. You select an
intersection and then all squares within

74
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
intersection and then all squares within
 

75
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,190
intersection and then all squares within
10 ft of that point. Remember,

76
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
10 ft of that point. Remember,
 

77
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,749
10 ft of that point. Remember,
alternating diagonal squares count as 10

78
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
alternating diagonal squares count as 10
 

79
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,030
alternating diagonal squares count as 10
ft. So, a 10-ft burst will not hit a

80
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
ft. So, a 10-ft burst will not hit a
 

81
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,789
ft. So, a 10-ft burst will not hit a
target that is two squares away

82
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
target that is two squares away
 

83
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,030
target that is two squares away
diagonally.

84
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
diagonally.
 

85
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,830
diagonally.
Cone areas can be a little tricky. When

86
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
Cone areas can be a little tricky. When
 

87
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,990
Cone areas can be a little tricky. When
casting a spell with a cone area, you

88
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
casting a spell with a cone area, you
 

89
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,990
casting a spell with a cone area, you
select either a corner or intersection

90
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
select either a corner or intersection
 

91
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,990
select either a corner or intersection
of squares like you would with a burst,

92
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
of squares like you would with a burst,
 

93
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,550
of squares like you would with a burst,
or you can select the entire side of one

94
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
or you can select the entire side of one
 

95
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,950
or you can select the entire side of one
of your squares. In both cases, the

96
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
of your squares. In both cases, the
 

97
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,030
of your squares. In both cases, the
caster must be adjacent to the point of

98
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
caster must be adjacent to the point of
 

99
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,230
caster must be adjacent to the point of
origin without standing inside the area

100
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
origin without standing inside the area
 

101
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,789
origin without standing inside the area
of the cone. And the area will expand

102
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
of the cone. And the area will expand
 

103
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,030
of the cone. And the area will expand
the further it moves from the caster in

104
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
the further it moves from the caster in
 

105
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,669
the further it moves from the caster in
one quarter direction. When drawing a

106
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
one quarter direction. When drawing a
 

107
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,070
one quarter direction. When drawing a
cone area diagonally, you select one

108
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
cone area diagonally, you select one
 

109
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,470
cone area diagonally, you select one
quarter of the square you occupy and

110
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
quarter of the square you occupy and
 

111
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,710
quarter of the square you occupy and
then choose one quarter direction and

112
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
then choose one quarter direction and
 

113
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,510
then choose one quarter direction and
all squares within range of that point

114
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
all squares within range of that point
 

115
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,070
all squares within range of that point
in that direction are affected by the

116
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
in that direction are affected by the
 

117
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,150
in that direction are affected by the
spell. Let's illustrate that with an

118
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
spell. Let's illustrate that with an
 

119
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,949
spell. Let's illustrate that with an
example. Ezren is surrounded by goblins

120
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
example. Ezren is surrounded by goblins
 

121
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,110
example. Ezren is surrounded by goblins
and wants to target as many as possible

122
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
and wants to target as many as possible
 

123
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,830
and wants to target as many as possible
with breathe fire, which is a 15 ft

124
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
with breathe fire, which is a 15 ft
 

125
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,630
with breathe fire, which is a 15 ft
cone. His first option is to draw the

126
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
cone. His first option is to draw the
 

127
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,270
cone. His first option is to draw the
cone diagonally. In this case, he will

128
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
cone diagonally. In this case, he will
 

129
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,270
cone diagonally. In this case, he will
choose one of the corners of the square

130
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
choose one of the corners of the square
 

131
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,470
choose one of the corners of the square
he occupies, and all squares within 15

132
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
he occupies, and all squares within 15
 

133
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,470
he occupies, and all squares within 15
feet of that point in one quarter

134
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
feet of that point in one quarter
 

135
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,110
feet of that point in one quarter
direction will be hit by the spell. Or

136
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
direction will be hit by the spell. Or
 

137
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,110
direction will be hit by the spell. Or
another way to think of it is if you're

138
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
another way to think of it is if you're
 

139
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,910
another way to think of it is if you're
making a 15- ft cone, 15 ft is three

140
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
making a 15- ft cone, 15 ft is three
 

141
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,790
making a 15- ft cone, 15 ft is three
squares. So, start by drawing two three

142
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
squares. So, start by drawing two three
 

143
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,430
squares. So, start by drawing two three
square lines at a 90° angle from your

144
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
square lines at a 90° angle from your
 

145
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,070
square lines at a 90° angle from your
selected corner first, and then fill in

146
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
selected corner first, and then fill in
 

147
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,910
selected corner first, and then fill in
the middle square so that all squares

148
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
the middle square so that all squares
 

149
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,390
the middle square so that all squares
within 15 ft from the point of origin

150
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
within 15 ft from the point of origin
 

151
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,869
within 15 ft from the point of origin
are affected.

152
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
are affected.
 

153
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,670
are affected.
That's drawing a cone diagonally. The

154
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
That's drawing a cone diagonally. The
 

155
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,390
That's drawing a cone diagonally. The
other way to draw a cone is orthogonal.

156
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
other way to draw a cone is orthogonal.
 

157
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,790
other way to draw a cone is orthogonal.
In this case, you don't select a corner

158
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
In this case, you don't select a corner
 

159
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,949
In this case, you don't select a corner
of your square, but instead choose an

160
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
of your square, but instead choose an
 

161
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,670
of your square, but instead choose an

162
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
entire side of your square. And the
 

163
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,910
entire side of your square. And the
design of these cones, unfortunately,

164
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
design of these cones, unfortunately,
 

165
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,949
design of these cones, unfortunately,
becomes more complex. 15- ft cones are

166
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
becomes more complex. 15- ft cones are
 

167
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,110
becomes more complex. 15- ft cones are
easy enough. the area expands outward

168
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
easy enough. the area expands outward
 

169
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,229
easy enough. the area expands outward
from you and hits a 3x3 area centered on

170
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
from you and hits a 3x3 area centered on
 

171
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,149
from you and hits a 3x3 area centered on
the side of the square that you select

172
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
the side of the square that you select
 

173
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,070
the side of the square that you select
except for the other two squares that

174
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
except for the other two squares that
 

175
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,710
except for the other two squares that
are adjacent to you. In this example,

176
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
are adjacent to you. In this example,
 

177
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,110
are adjacent to you. In this example,
only the gold squares are hit by breathe

178
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
only the gold squares are hit by breathe
 

179

only the gold squares are hit by breathe
fire. The two other adjacent squares are

180
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
fire. The two other adjacent squares are
 

181
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,750
fire. The two other adjacent squares are
safe. Imagine it's a cone that's

182
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
safe. Imagine it's a cone that's
 

183
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,630
safe. Imagine it's a cone that's
widening as it moves away from you. But

184
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
widening as it moves away from you. But
 

185
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,190
widening as it moves away from you. But
the design of orthogonal cones becomes

186
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
the design of orthogonal cones becomes
 

187
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,789
the design of orthogonal cones becomes
pretty complex beyond 15 feet because 30

188
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
pretty complex beyond 15 feet because 30

pretty complex beyond 15 feet because 30
foot and 60 foot orthogonal cones

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
foot and 60 foot orthogonal cones
 

191
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,070
foot and 60 foot orthogonal cones
actually begin decreasing in size after

00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
actually begin decreasing in size after
 

193
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,030
actually begin decreasing in size after
a certain point whereas diagonal cones

a certain point whereas diagonal cones
 

195
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,910

do not do that. So I would recommend you

196
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
do not do that. So I would recommend you
 

197
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,710
do not do that. So I would recommend you

202
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120

203
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,429

Next are iminations. And these are

204
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
Next are iminations. And these are
 

205
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,830
Next are iminations. And these are
thankfully very simple. They work like

206
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
thankfully very simple. They work like
 

207
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,830
thankfully very simple. They work like
bursts except instead of choosing an

intersection of squares, the area

210
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
intersection of squares, the area
 

211
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,909
intersection of squares, the area
originates from you. So a 5-ft imination

212
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
originates from you. So a 5-ft imination
 

213
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,790
originates from you. So a 5-ft imination
affects every square adjacent to you.

214
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
affects every square adjacent to you.
 

215
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,110
affects every square adjacent to you.
And a 10-ft imination hits everything

216
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
And a 10-ft imination hits everything
 

217
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,830
And a 10-ft imination hits everything
within 10 ft of you. And note that the

218
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
within 10 ft of you. And note that the
 

219
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,430
within 10 ft of you. And note that the
person who cast the spell and is

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
person who cast the spell and is
 

221
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,990
person who cast the spell and is
standing in the center of his area gets

And last are lines. Lines,
 

229
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,830
And last are lines. Lines,
unfortunately, are more complicated than

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
unfortunately, are more complicated than
 

231
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,790
unfortunately, are more complicated than
you might think. A line is 5 ft wide and

232
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
you might think. A line is 5 ft wide and
 

233
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,870
you might think. A line is 5 ft wide and
travels in one direction for the number

234
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
travels in one direction for the number
 

235
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,189
travels in one direction for the number
of feet that's listed. You start by

236
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
of feet that's listed. You start by
 

237
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,430
of feet that's listed. You start by
selecting the first square and then

238
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
selecting the first square and then
 

239
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,749
selecting the first square and then
select an ending square. that is the

240
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
select an ending square. that is the
 

241
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,310
select an ending square. that is the
number of listed feet away and then

242
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
number of listed feet away and then
 

243
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,990
number of listed feet away and then
connect those squares with the line

244
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
connect those squares with the line
 

245
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,550
connect those squares with the line
moving in one direction. Meaning that

246
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
moving in one direction. Meaning that
 

247
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,790
moving in one direction. Meaning that
every square the line passes through

248
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
every square the line passes through
 

249
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,350
every square the line passes through
must be both further from the point of

250
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
must be both further from the point of
 

251
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,469
must be both further from the point of
origin and closer to the final square

252
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
origin and closer to the final square
 

253
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,950
origin and closer to the final square
than the square before it. The line can

254
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
than the square before it. The line can
 

255
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,870
than the square before it. The line can
move through squares diagonally as long

256
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
move through squares diagonally as long
 

257
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,629
move through squares diagonally as long
as it's always diagonally in the same

258
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
as it's always diagonally in the same
 

259
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,029
as it's always diagonally in the same
direction. And those diagonal breaks

260
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
direction. And those diagonal breaks
 

261
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,749
direction. And those diagonal breaks
should be as equidistant as possible.

262
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
should be as equidistant as possible.
 

263
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,749
should be as equidistant as possible.
Basically, this means a 30-foot line

264
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
Basically, this means a 30-foot line
 

265
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,150
Basically, this means a 30-foot line
might look like this,

266
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
might look like this,
 

267
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,629
might look like this,
or like this,

268
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
or like this,
 

269
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,990
or like this,
or it might even look like this.

270
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
or it might even look like this.
 

271
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,629
or it might even look like this.
And believe it or not, a 30foot line

272
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
And believe it or not, a 30foot line
 

273
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,909
And believe it or not, a 30foot line
could look like this, or even like this.

274
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
could look like this, or even like this.
 

275
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,629
could look like this, or even like this.
In my opinion, as long as each square of

276
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
In my opinion, as long as each square of
 

277
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,110
In my opinion, as long as each square of
the line is connected and each square is

278
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
the line is connected and each square is
 

279
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,189
the line is connected and each square is
further from the starting square and

280
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
further from the starting square and
 

281
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,270
further from the starting square and
closer to the final square, it should

282
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
closer to the final square, it should
 

283
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,430
closer to the final square, it should
count. Or if you really want to keep

284
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
count. Or if you really want to keep
 

285
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,670
count. Or if you really want to keep
life easy, just stick to lines that are

286
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
life easy, just stick to lines that are
 

287
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,670
life easy, just stick to lines that are
perfectly straight orthagonally or

288
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
perfectly straight orthagonally or
 

289
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,309
perfectly straight orthagonally or
diagonally.

290
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
diagonally.
 

291
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,110
diagonally.
And one more note about area effects. If

292
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
And one more note about area effects. If
 

293
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,590
And one more note about area effects. If
the spell originates from the caster,

294
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
the spell originates from the caster,
 

295
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,550
the spell originates from the caster,
then it only has an area, but other

296
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
then it only has an area, but other
 

297
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,430
then it only has an area, but other
spells might include both a range and an

298
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
spells might include both a range and an
 

299
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,990
spells might include both a range and an
area, such as with fireball. In this

300
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
area, such as with fireball. In this
 

301
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,309
area, such as with fireball. In this
case, it has a range of 500 ft and

302
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
case, it has a range of 500 ft and
 

303
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,270
case, it has a range of 500 ft and
affects a 20ft burst area. What this

304
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
affects a 20ft burst area. What this
 

305
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,510
affects a 20ft burst area. What this
means is the intersection of squares

306
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
means is the intersection of squares
 

307
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,590
means is the intersection of squares
that is chosen as the point of origin

308
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
that is chosen as the point of origin
 

309
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,550
that is chosen as the point of origin
for the spell must be within 500 ft. 500

310
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
for the spell must be within 500 ft. 500
 

311
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,350
for the spell must be within 500 ft. 500
ft is 100 squares which is way too much

312
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
ft is 100 squares which is way too much
 

313
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,590
ft is 100 squares which is way too much
for me to fit on the screen here. But

314
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
for me to fit on the screen here. But
 

315
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,390
for me to fit on the screen here. But
let's just say that this line marks 500

316
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
let's just say that this line marks 500
 

317
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,909
let's just say that this line marks 500
ft from the wizard who is casting

318
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
ft from the wizard who is casting
 

319
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,150
ft from the wizard who is casting
fireball. They can target any

320
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
fireball. They can target any

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,270
fireball. They can target any
intersection or corner of squares below

322
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
intersection or corner of squares below
 

323
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,070
intersection or corner of squares below
this line. Any area above the line is

324
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
this line. Any area above the line is
 

325
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,350
this line. Any area above the line is
out of range, but only the point of

326
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
out of range, but only the point of
 

327
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,150
out of range, but only the point of
origin needs to be within range. So they

328
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
origin needs to be within range. So they
 

329
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,390
origin needs to be within range. So they
could target this intersection, which

330
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
could target this intersection, which
 

331
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,350
could target this intersection, which
would cause a 20 ft burst area and

332
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
would cause a 20 ft burst area and
 

333
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,510
would cause a 20 ft burst area and
affect all targets within 20 ft of the

334
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
affect all targets within 20 ft of the
 

335
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,749
affect all targets within 20 ft of the
targeted intersection, even those

336
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
targeted intersection, even those
 

337
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,550
targeted intersection, even those
squares that are beyond the 500 ft range

338
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
squares that are beyond the 500 ft range
 

339
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,350
squares that are beyond the 500 ft range
from the caster.

340
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
from the caster.
 

341
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,510
from the caster.
