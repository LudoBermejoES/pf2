discussing spell mechanics, starting
 

19
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,990
discussing spell mechanics, starting
with casting time and spell durations.

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
with casting time and spell durations.

The cast entry in a spell description
 

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,310
The cast entry in a spell description
lists the amount of time needed to cast

24
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
lists the amount of time needed to cast
 

25
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,710
lists the amount of time needed to cast
the spell. This is usually displayed as

26
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
the spell. This is usually displayed as
 

27
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,870
the spell. This is usually displayed as
a number of actions to be spent in

28
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
a number of actions to be spent in
 

29
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,270
a number of actions to be spent in
encounter mode, but could also be a

encounter mode, but could also be a
 

31
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,350
encounter mode, but could also be a
number of minutes, such as the case with

32
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
number of minutes, such as the case with
 

33
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,590
number of minutes, such as the case with
Raised Dead if the spell is intended to

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
Raised Dead if the spell is intended to
 

35
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,470
Raised Dead if the spell is intended to

spells, like breath of life, can be cast
 

39
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,670
spells, like breath of life, can be cast
as a reaction. Most encounter spells

as a reaction. Most encounter spells
 

41
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,709
as a reaction. Most encounter spells
require two actions to cast, but many

require two actions to cast, but many
 

43
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,029

actions. But those are just rules of
 

53
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,229
actions. But those are just rules of
thumb. Always check the spell

thumb. Always check the spell
 

55
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,710

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
The cast entry in a spell's description
 

59
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,550
The cast entry in a spell's description
tells you how long it takes to activate

60
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
tells you how long it takes to activate
 

61
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,109
tells you how long it takes to activate
the spell, and the duration entry tells

62
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
the spell, and the duration entry tells
 

63
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,310
the spell, and the duration entry tells
you how long it will persist after that.

64
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
you how long it will persist after that.
 

65
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,190
you how long it will persist after that.
If a spell has no listed duration, then

66
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
If a spell has no listed duration, then
 

67
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,390
If a spell has no listed duration, then
it's instantaneous. It starts and ends

68
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
it's instantaneous. It starts and ends
 

69
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,870
it's instantaneous. It starts and ends
on the caster's turn, but may have

70
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
on the caster's turn, but may have
 

71
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,749
on the caster's turn, but may have
effects that last longer than that. For

72
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
effects that last longer than that. For
 

73
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,630
effects that last longer than that. For
example, noise blast has no listed

74
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
example, noise blast has no listed
 

75
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,109
example, noise blast has no listed
duration and therefore is instantaneous,

76
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
duration and therefore is instantaneous,
 

77
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,510
duration and therefore is instantaneous,
but the target might become deafened or

78
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
but the target might become deafened or
 

79
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,230
but the target might become deafened or
stunned for 10 more rounds. When an

80
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
stunned for 10 more rounds. When an
 

81
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,630
stunned for 10 more rounds. When an
effect lasts longer than the duration,

82
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
effect lasts longer than the duration,
 

83
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,510
effect lasts longer than the duration,
like in this case, the effect is not

84
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
like in this case, the effect is not
 

85
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,310
like in this case, the effect is not
considered to be magical, and therefore

86
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
considered to be magical, and therefore
 

87
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,630
considered to be magical, and therefore
something like dispel magic could not be

88
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
something like dispel magic could not be
 

89
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,590
something like dispel magic could not be
used to cure the victim's deafness. And

90
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
used to cure the victim's deafness. And
 

91
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,830
used to cure the victim's deafness. And
when the duration is listed as a number

92
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
when the duration is listed as a number
 

93
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,149
when the duration is listed as a number
of rounds, the number of rounds

94
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
of rounds, the number of rounds
 

95
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,030
of rounds, the number of rounds
remaining decreases by one at the start

96
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
remaining decreases by one at the start
 

97
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,149
remaining decreases by one at the start
of each of the spellcasters turns and

98
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
of each of the spellcasters turns and
 

99
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,789
of each of the spellcasters turns and
ends when that duration reaches zero.

100
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
ends when that duration reaches zero.
 

101
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,869
ends when that duration reaches zero.
Some spells have a list duration which

102
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
Some spells have a list duration which
 

103
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,670
Some spells have a list duration which
include the word sustain. When you cast

104
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
include the word sustain. When you cast
 

105
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,550
include the word sustain. When you cast
a sustained spell, it is due to expire

106
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
a sustained spell, it is due to expire
 

107
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,589
a sustained spell, it is due to expire
at the end of your next turn after you

108
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
at the end of your next turn after you
 

109
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,710
at the end of your next turn after you
cast it, unless you spend an action on

110
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
cast it, unless you spend an action on
 

111
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,190
cast it, unless you spend an action on
that turn to extend the spell's duration

112
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
that turn to extend the spell's duration
 

113
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,750
that turn to extend the spell's duration
by another round. To do this, you spend

114
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
by another round. To do this, you spend
 

115
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,710
by another round. To do this, you spend
one action to use sustain a spell, which

116
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
one action to use sustain a spell, which
 

117
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,869
one action to use sustain a spell, which
allows you to add enough magic energy

118
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
allows you to add enough magic energy
 

119
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,949
allows you to add enough magic energy
and thought into the spell to keep it

120
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
and thought into the spell to keep it
 

121
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,750
and thought into the spell to keep it
going for another round. Now, the spell

122
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
going for another round. Now, the spell
 

123
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,390
going for another round. Now, the spell
will cease at the end of your next turn

124
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
will cease at the end of your next turn
 

125
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,550
will cease at the end of your next turn
unless you spin an action on that round

126
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
unless you spin an action on that round
 

127
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,509
unless you spin an action on that round
to sustain it again and so on. And note

128
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
to sustain it again and so on. And note
 

129
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,670
to sustain it again and so on. And note
that a common question is what happens

130
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
that a common question is what happens
 

131
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,309
that a common question is what happens
if the caster falls unconscious or dies

132
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
if the caster falls unconscious or dies
 

133
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,270
if the caster falls unconscious or dies
before the duration is up. And the

134
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
before the duration is up. And the
 

135
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,430
before the duration is up. And the
answer is well, nothing happens. The

136
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
answer is well, nothing happens. The
 

137
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,229
answer is well, nothing happens. The
spell continues to persist even if the

138
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
spell continues to persist even if the
 

139
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,589
spell continues to persist even if the
caster dies before its duration is up.

140
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
caster dies before its duration is up.
 

141
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,790
caster dies before its duration is up.
Think of it like fuel. enough magic fuel

142
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
Think of it like fuel. enough magic fuel
 

143
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,710
Think of it like fuel. enough magic fuel
was put into the spell when it was cast

144
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
was put into the spell when it was cast
 

145
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,190
was put into the spell when it was cast
to keep it going until it runs out when

146
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
to keep it going until it runs out when
 

147
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,070
to keep it going until it runs out when
the spell's duration ends. And this also

148
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
the spell's duration ends. And this also
 

149
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,390
the spell's duration ends. And this also
means that by raw, a person could cast a

150
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
means that by raw, a person could cast a
 

151
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,910
means that by raw, a person could cast a
sustained spell, get knocked

152
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
sustained spell, get knocked
 

153
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,070
sustained spell, get knocked
unconscious, and as long as they get

154
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
unconscious, and as long as they get
 

155
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,390
unconscious, and as long as they get
revived before their next turn, they

156
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
revived before their next turn, they
 

157
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,630
revived before their next turn, they
could use sustain a spell again to keep

158
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
could use sustain a spell again to keep
 

159
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,509
could use sustain a spell again to keep
the spell going. Also, most spells that

the spell going. Also, most spells that
 

161
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,910
the spell going. Also, most spells that
allow you to sustain them have a maximum

162
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
allow you to sustain them have a maximum
 

163
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,550
allow you to sustain them have a maximum
duration, like 1 minute, that you can't

164
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
duration, like 1 minute, that you can't
 

165
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,589
duration, like 1 minute, that you can't
sustain beyond that. And if a maximum

166
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
sustain beyond that. And if a maximum
 

167
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,830
sustain beyond that. And if a maximum
duration is not listed, then you can

168
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
duration is not listed, then you can
 

169
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,390
duration is not listed, then you can
sustain it for up to 10 minutes or 100

170
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
sustain it for up to 10 minutes or 100
 

171
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,030
sustain it for up to 10 minutes or 100
rounds, after which you become fatigued

172
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
rounds, after which you become fatigued
 

173
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,990
rounds, after which you become fatigued
and cannot sustain it anymore. If you

174
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
and cannot sustain it anymore. If you
 

175
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,670
and cannot sustain it anymore. If you
want to cast it again, you'll need to

176
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
want to cast it again, you'll need to
 

177
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,869
want to cast it again, you'll need to
use a spell slot like normal.

178
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
use a spell slot like normal.
 

179
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,869
use a spell slot like normal.
Now, when it comes to sustaining spells,

180
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
Now, when it comes to sustaining spells,
 

181
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,949
Now, when it comes to sustaining spells,
there are a few more questions that seem

182
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
there are a few more questions that seem
 

183
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,750
there are a few more questions that seem
to pop up. The first of those is, can I

184
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
to pop up. The first of those is, can I
 

185
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,750
to pop up. The first of those is, can I
sustain multiple spells at the same

186
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
sustain multiple spells at the same
 

187
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,070
sustain multiple spells at the same
time? And the answer to that is yes, you

188
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
time? And the answer to that is yes, you
 

189
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,710
time? And the answer to that is yes, you
can. If you somehow have three active

190
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
can. If you somehow have three active
 

191
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,470
can. If you somehow have three active
spells that all have a duration of

192
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
spells that all have a duration of
 

193
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,390
spells that all have a duration of
sustain and have not passed their

194
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
sustain and have not passed their
 

195
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,110
sustain and have not passed their
maximum durations, then you could spend

196
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
maximum durations, then you could spend
 

197
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,270
maximum durations, then you could spend
three actions and continue to sustain

198
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
three actions and continue to sustain
 

199
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,670
three actions and continue to sustain
all three of them. The second question

200
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
all three of them. The second question
 

201
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,589
all three of them. The second question
is, can I sustain the same spell

202
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
is, can I sustain the same spell
 

203
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,910
is, can I sustain the same spell
multiple times in the same round? And

204
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
multiple times in the same round? And
 

205
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,629
multiple times in the same round? And
the answer to this is also yes. So on

206
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
the answer to this is also yes. So on
 

207
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,310
the answer to this is also yes. So on
the round following the casting of a

208
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
the round following the casting of a
 

209
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,230
the round following the casting of a
sustained spell, you can spend three

210
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
sustained spell, you can spend three
 

211
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,550
sustained spell, you can spend three
actions to sustain the spell three times

212
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
actions to sustain the spell three times
 

213
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,430
actions to sustain the spell three times
and trigger its effect three times. A

214
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
and trigger its effect three times. A
 

215
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,430
and trigger its effect three times. A
good example of this would be spiritual

216
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
good example of this would be spiritual
 

217
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,990
good example of this would be spiritual
arament where each time you sustain it,

218
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
arament where each time you sustain it,
 

219
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,870
arament where each time you sustain it,
it attacks another time. However, some

220
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
it attacks another time. However, some
 

221
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,030
it attacks another time. However, some
spells like floating flame include

222
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
spells like floating flame include
 

223
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,230
spells like floating flame include
special notations. Here it says a given

224
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
special notations. Here it says a given
 

225
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,150
special notations. Here it says a given
creature can take damage from floating

226
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
creature can take damage from floating
 

227
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,350
creature can take damage from floating
flame only once per round. So, there's

228
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
flame only once per round. So, there's
 

229
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,350
flame only once per round. So, there's
nothing preventing you from using three

230
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
nothing preventing you from using three
 

231
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,510
nothing preventing you from using three
actions to sustain floating flame three

232
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
actions to sustain floating flame three
 

233
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,150
actions to sustain floating flame three
times. But if you deal damage to a

234
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
times. But if you deal damage to a
 

235
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,909
times. But if you deal damage to a
target the first time, you'll need to

236
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
target the first time, you'll need to
 

237
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,830
target the first time, you'll need to
use the remaining sustain actions to

238
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
use the remaining sustain actions to
 

239
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,710
use the remaining sustain actions to
target other enemies.

240
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
target other enemies.
 

241
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,270
target other enemies.
Some spells like environmental endurance

242
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
Some spells like environmental endurance
 

243
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,150
Some spells like environmental endurance
have durations that say until your next

244
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
have durations that say until your next
 

245
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,950
have durations that say until your next
daily preparations. What this means is

246
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
daily preparations. What this means is
 

247
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,950
daily preparations. What this means is
on your next day as part of your daily

248
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
on your next day as part of your daily
 

249
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,270
on your next day as part of your daily
preparations, you can choose to not

250
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
preparations, you can choose to not
 

251
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,150
preparations, you can choose to not
regain that spell slot. Doing so

252
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
regain that spell slot. Doing so
 

253
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,629
regain that spell slot. Doing so
basically sustains the spell and extends

254
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
basically sustains the spell and extends
 

255
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,950
basically sustains the spell and extends
its duration for another day until your

256
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
its duration for another day until your
 

257
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,670
its duration for another day until your
next daily preparations. This lets you

258
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
next daily preparations. This lets you
 

259
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,390
next daily preparations. This lets you
sustain the spell over very long periods

260
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
sustain the spell over very long periods
 

261
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,950
sustain the spell over very long periods
of time. But if you ever do choose to

262
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
of time. But if you ever do choose to
 

263
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,870
of time. But if you ever do choose to
regain that spell slot during daily

264
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
regain that spell slot during daily
 

265
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,430
regain that spell slot during daily
preparations, then the spell immediately

266
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
preparations, then the spell immediately
 

267
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,310
preparations, then the spell immediately
ends. If you are ever unconscious or

268
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
ends. If you are ever unconscious or
 

269
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,950
ends. If you are ever unconscious or
dead at the 24-hour mark after the last

270
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
dead at the 24-hour mark after the last
 

271
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,670
dead at the 24-hour mark after the last
preparations, you cannot sustain it and

272
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
preparations, you cannot sustain it and
 

273
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,469
preparations, you cannot sustain it and
the spell ends. Also, the spell must

274
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
the spell ends. Also, the spell must
 

275
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,550
the spell ends. Also, the spell must
have been cast using a spell slot, and

276
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
have been cast using a spell slot, and
 

277
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,950
have been cast using a spell slot, and
you must use spell slots to continue it.

278
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
you must use spell slots to continue it.
 

279
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,790
you must use spell slots to continue it.
So, for example, you can't use charges

280
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
So, for example, you can't use charges
 

281
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,749
So, for example, you can't use charges
from a staff or use a magic wand or any

282
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
from a staff or use a magic wand or any
 

283
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,749
from a staff or use a magic wand or any
other magic item for this purpose of

284
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
other magic item for this purpose of
 

285
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,710
other magic item for this purpose of
extending the duration. Last, if a spell

286
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
extending the duration. Last, if a spell
 

287
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,909
extending the duration. Last, if a spell
has a duration of unlimited, like embed

288
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
has a duration of unlimited, like embed
 

289
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,469
has a duration of unlimited, like embed
message, you don't need to reserve spell

290
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
message, you don't need to reserve spell
 

291
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,950
message, you don't need to reserve spell
slots in this way to continue it. If the

292
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
slots in this way to continue it. If the
 

293
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,189
slots in this way to continue it. If the
duration is unlimited, then it lasts

294
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
duration is unlimited, then it lasts
 

295
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,430
duration is unlimited, then it lasts
until it is either counteracted or you

296
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
until it is either counteracted or you
 

297
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,870
until it is either counteracted or you
dismiss it. And speaking of dismissing,

298
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
dismiss it. And speaking of dismissing,
 

299
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,870
dismiss it. And speaking of dismissing,
dismissing a spell allows you to end it

300
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
dismissing a spell allows you to end it
 

301
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,430
dismissing a spell allows you to end it
early before its listed duration is up.

302
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
early before its listed duration is up.
 

303
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,150
early before its listed duration is up.
Doing so costs one action, but note that

304
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
Doing so costs one action, but note that
 

305
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,189
Doing so costs one action, but note that
by raw, only spells that specifically

306
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
by raw, only spells that specifically
 

307
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,270
by raw, only spells that specifically
say they can be dismissed can be

308
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
say they can be dismissed can be
 

309
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,749
say they can be dismissed can be
dismissed. For example, the confusion

310
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
dismissed. For example, the confusion
 

311
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,390
dismissed. For example, the confusion
spell shows this. But if a spell does

312
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
spell shows this. But if a spell does
 

313
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,629
spell shows this. But if a spell does
not specifically state that it can be

314
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
not specifically state that it can be
 

315
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,629
not specifically state that it can be
dismissed, then you'll need to wait

316
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
dismissed, then you'll need to wait
 

317
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,189
dismissed, then you'll need to wait
until its duration is up in order for it

318
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
until its duration is up in order for it
 

319
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,189
until its duration is up in order for it
to end.

320
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
to end.
 

321
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,189
to end.
