00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,030
Hey everybody, Dave here with another
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,040
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And
 

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,309
Pathfinder rule reminder for you. And
today we're going to be looking at

6
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
today we're going to be looking at
 

7
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,310
today we're going to be looking at
non-lethal damage. So non-lethal damage

8
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
non-lethal damage. So non-lethal damage
 

9
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,549
non-lethal damage. So non-lethal damage
is an option in the rules that allow you

10
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
is an option in the rules that allow you
 

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,070
is an option in the rules that allow you
to make attacks with the intent to

12
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
to make attacks with the intent to
 

13
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,790
to make attacks with the intent to
disable your opponent as opposed to kill

14
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
disable your opponent as opposed to kill
 

15
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,470
disable your opponent as opposed to kill
them. Because this is a high fantasy

16
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
them. Because this is a high fantasy
 

17
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,990
them. Because this is a high fantasy
actionoriented

18
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
actionoriented
 

19
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,950
actionoriented
adventure role playing game, the default

20
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
adventure role playing game, the default
 

21
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,710
adventure role playing game, the default
rules in the game uh assume lethal

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
rules in the game uh assume lethal
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,630
rules in the game uh assume lethal
damage. It assumes that you are trying

24
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
damage. It assumes that you are trying
 

25
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,790
damage. It assumes that you are trying
to kill the goblin or dragon or manticor

26
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
to kill the goblin or dragon or manticor

or whatever that uh your party is
facing. But it does provide non-lethal

30
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640

31
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,790

damage options for those who want to

32
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
damage options for those who want to
 

33
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,670
damage options for those who want to
subdue their targets. So, you might want

34
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
subdue their targets. So, you might want
 

35
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,750
subdue their targets. So, you might want
to use non-lethal damage when you want

36
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
to use non-lethal damage when you want
 

37
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,950
to use non-lethal damage when you want
to capture somebody and question them if

38
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
to capture somebody and question them if
 

39
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,470
to capture somebody and question them if
you're a bounty hunter and you're going

40
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
you're a bounty hunter and you're going
 

41
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,069
you're a bounty hunter and you're going
to get paid more to bring your target

42
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
to get paid more to bring your target
 

43
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,790
to get paid more to bring your target
back alive than dead or you're in any

44
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
back alive than dead or you're in any
 

45
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,310
back alive than dead or you're in any
kind of situation where you don't want

46
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
kind of situation where you don't want
 

47
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,270
kind of situation where you don't want
things to escalate. So, instead of of

48
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
things to escalate. So, instead of of
 

49
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,830
things to escalate. So, instead of of
killing the town's people, you subdue

50
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
killing the town's people, you subdue
 

51
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,149
killing the town's people, you subdue
them with non-lethal damage or maybe for

52
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
them with non-lethal damage or maybe for
 

53
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,070
them with non-lethal damage or maybe for
those times when uh one of your party

54
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
those times when uh one of your party
 

55
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,910
those times when uh one of your party
members gets controlled or goes mad and

56
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
members gets controlled or goes mad and
 

57
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,990
members gets controlled or goes mad and
uh you got to you got to put them down

58
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
uh you got to you got to put them down
 

59
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,429
uh you got to you got to put them down
without killing them. These are all

60
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
without killing them. These are all
 

61
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,270
without killing them. These are all
situations where you might want to use

62
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
situations where you might want to use
 

63
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,789
situations where you might want to use
non-lethal damage instead of the regular

64
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
non-lethal damage instead of the regular
 

65
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,550
non-lethal damage instead of the regular
lethal damage uh rules. So, what does

66
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
lethal damage uh rules. So, what does
 

67
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,830
lethal damage uh rules. So, what does
this mean when you use non-lethal

68
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
this mean when you use non-lethal
 

69
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,990
this mean when you use non-lethal
damage? Well, in the the the the vast

70
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
damage? Well, in the the the the vast
 

71
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,109
damage? Well, in the the the the vast
range of combat, it doesn't mean a lot.

72
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
range of combat, it doesn't mean a lot.
 

73
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,230
range of combat, it doesn't mean a lot.
It really only comes down to the last

74
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
It really only comes down to the last
 

75
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,310
It really only comes down to the last
hit that reduces your target to zero hit

76
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
hit that reduces your target to zero hit
 

77
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,510
hit that reduces your target to zero hit
points. If that is dealt using lethal

78
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
points. If that is dealt using lethal
 

79
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,870
points. If that is dealt using lethal
damage, then in most cases, they die. Or

80
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
damage, then in most cases, they die. Or
 

81
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,910
damage, then in most cases, they die. Or
if they're a significant uh NPC or a

82
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
if they're a significant uh NPC or a
 

83
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,069
if they're a significant uh NPC or a
player character, they fall unconscious

84
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
player character, they fall unconscious
 

85
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,910
player character, they fall unconscious
and they gain the dying condition.

86
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
and they gain the dying condition.
 

87
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,630
and they gain the dying condition.
That's lethal damage. the normal damage

88
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
That's lethal damage. the normal damage
 

89
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,830
That's lethal damage. the normal damage
rules. If that final hit that reduces

90
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
rules. If that final hit that reduces
 

91
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,469
rules. If that final hit that reduces
them to zero hit points is made with

92
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
them to zero hit points is made with
 

93
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,350
them to zero hit points is made with
non-lethal damage, then instead they

94
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
non-lethal damage, then instead they
 

95
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,510
non-lethal damage, then instead they
just fall unconscious.

96
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
just fall unconscious.
 

97
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,869
just fall unconscious.
Uh this does not impose the dying

98
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
Uh this does not impose the dying
 

99
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,990
Uh this does not impose the dying
condition. You don't have to make

100
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
condition. You don't have to make
 

101
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,470
condition. You don't have to make
recovery checks. This does not interact

102
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
recovery checks. This does not interact
 

103
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,830
recovery checks. This does not interact
in any way with the wounded condition.

104
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
in any way with the wounded condition.
 

105
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,550
in any way with the wounded condition.
You don't gain the wounded condition or

106
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
You don't gain the wounded condition or
 

107
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,589
You don't gain the wounded condition or
elevate it when you leave an unconscious

108
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
elevate it when you leave an unconscious
 

109
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,470
elevate it when you leave an unconscious
state. If that last hit is dealt with

110
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
state. If that last hit is dealt with
 

111
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,910
state. If that last hit is dealt with
non-lethal damage, then no dying

112
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
non-lethal damage, then no dying
 

113
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,990
non-lethal damage, then no dying
condition, no wounded condition, no

114
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
condition, no wounded condition, no
 

115
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,470
condition, no wounded condition, no
recovery checks, essentially they fall

116
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
recovery checks, essentially they fall
 

117
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,229
recovery checks, essentially they fall
unconscious, they gain the unconscious

118
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
unconscious, they gain the unconscious
 

119
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,910
unconscious, they gain the unconscious
condition, they have zero hit points,

120
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
condition, they have zero hit points,
 

121
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,910
condition, they have zero hit points,
and they're effectively stable. Again,

122
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
and they're effectively stable. Again,
 

123
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,390
and they're effectively stable. Again,
none of these recovery checks. There's

124
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
none of these recovery checks. There's
 

125
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,150
none of these recovery checks. There's
no hard rule for how long they stay in

126
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
no hard rule for how long they stay in
 

127
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,110
no hard rule for how long they stay in
that unconscious state, but if they

128
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
that unconscious state, but if they
 

129
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,190
that unconscious state, but if they
receive any healing and they go above

130
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
receive any healing and they go above
 

131
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,030
receive any healing and they go above
zero hit points, they would become

132
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
zero hit points, they would become
 

133
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,150
zero hit points, they would become
conscious again. And in absence of that,

134
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,160
conscious again. And in absence of that,
 

135
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,670
conscious again. And in absence of that,
it it like I said, it doesn't give you a

136
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
it it like I said, it doesn't give you a
 

137
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,589
it it like I said, it doesn't give you a
hard guideline. It just says like about

138
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
hard guideline. It just says like about
 

139
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,949
hard guideline. It just says like about
a minute or so. Uh basically that's you

140
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
a minute or so. Uh basically that's you
 

141
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,670
a minute or so. Uh basically that's you
know that's Pathfinder language for when

142
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
know that's Pathfinder language for when
 

143
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,550
know that's Pathfinder language for when
this combat encounter is over they'll

144
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
this combat encounter is over they'll
 

145
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,990
this combat encounter is over they'll
regain consciousness normally. As always

146
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
regain consciousness normally. As always
 

147
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,830
regain consciousness normally. As always
GMs evaluate the situation however makes

148
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
GMs evaluate the situation however makes
 

149
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,910
GMs evaluate the situation however makes
sense to you. So some situations might

150
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
sense to you. So some situations might
 

151
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,070
sense to you. So some situations might
cause you to to prolong that unconscious

152
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
cause you to to prolong that unconscious
 

153
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,910
cause you to to prolong that unconscious
state because again there's not a hard

154
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
state because again there's not a hard
 

155
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,589
state because again there's not a hard
rule. That's just the guidance in the

156
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
rule. That's just the guidance in the
 

157
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,070
rule. That's just the guidance in the
book. One minute. So how do you deal

158
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
book. One minute. So how do you deal
 

159
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,110
book. One minute. So how do you deal
non-lethal damage? Some weapons, some

160
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
non-lethal damage? Some weapons, some
 

161
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,990
non-lethal damage? Some weapons, some
melee weapons have the non-lethal trait.

162
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
melee weapons have the non-lethal trait.
 

163
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,390
melee weapons have the non-lethal trait.
And if a weapon has the non-lethal

164
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
And if a weapon has the non-lethal
 

165
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,149
And if a weapon has the non-lethal
trait, like a fist attack, most unarmed

166
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
trait, like a fist attack, most unarmed
 

167
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,229
trait, like a fist attack, most unarmed
attacks that aren't things like biting

168
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
attacks that aren't things like biting
 

169
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,789
attacks that aren't things like biting
and claws, uh the sap, a whip, these all

170
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
and claws, uh the sap, a whip, these all
 

171
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,030
and claws, uh the sap, a whip, these all
have the non-lethal trait. Non-lethal

172
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
have the non-lethal trait. Non-lethal
 

173
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,030
have the non-lethal trait. Non-lethal
trait weapons always deal non-lethal

174
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
trait weapons always deal non-lethal
 

175
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,070
trait weapons always deal non-lethal
damage unless you do something special.

176
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
damage unless you do something special.
 

177
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,710
damage unless you do something special.
So monks can deal lethal damage with

178
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
So monks can deal lethal damage with
 

179
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,750
So monks can deal lethal damage with
their unarmed attacks, but in absence of

180
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
their unarmed attacks, but in absence of
 

181
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,470
their unarmed attacks, but in absence of
any other ability, rule, special

182
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
any other ability, rule, special
 

183
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,869
any other ability, rule, special
circumstance, non-lethal weapons,

184
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
circumstance, non-lethal weapons,
 

185
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,869
circumstance, non-lethal weapons,
weapons with the non-lethal trait deal

186
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
weapons with the non-lethal trait deal
 

187
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,390
weapons with the non-lethal trait deal
exclusively

188
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
exclusively
 

189
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,430
exclusively
non-lethal damage.

190
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
non-lethal damage.
 

191
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,150
non-lethal damage.
Um, so,

192
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
Um, so,
 

193
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,990
Um, so,
uh, for some people it might make sense

194
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
uh, for some people it might make sense
 

195
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,310
uh, for some people it might make sense
that they carry one lethal weapon and

196
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
that they carry one lethal weapon and
 

197
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,469
that they carry one lethal weapon and
one non-lethal weapon. If you're someone

198
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
one non-lethal weapon. If you're someone
 

199
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,909
one non-lethal weapon. If you're someone
who's playing like a bounty hunter and

200
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
who's playing like a bounty hunter and
 

201
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,909
who's playing like a bounty hunter and
you think you're going to be uh dealing

202
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
you think you're going to be uh dealing
 

203
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,749
you think you're going to be uh dealing
a lot of non-lethal damage, you might

204
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
a lot of non-lethal damage, you might
 

205
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,749
a lot of non-lethal damage, you might
want to invest in like a shifting rune

206
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
want to invest in like a shifting rune
 

207
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,070
want to invest in like a shifting rune
for your weapon, so you can convert it

208
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
for your weapon, so you can convert it
 

209
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,550
for your weapon, so you can convert it
between uh similar weapons that either

210
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
between uh similar weapons that either
 

211
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,350
between uh similar weapons that either
deal lethal damage or non-lethal damage.

212
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
deal lethal damage or non-lethal damage.
 

213
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,710
deal lethal damage or non-lethal damage.
The bounty hunter archetype also has a

214
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
The bounty hunter archetype also has a
 

215
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,110
The bounty hunter archetype also has a
feat called tools of the trade that

216
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
feat called tools of the trade that
 

217
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,590
feat called tools of the trade that
would allow you to do an additional 1d4

218
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
would allow you to do an additional 1d4
 

219
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,749
would allow you to do an additional 1d4
precision damage with certain specific

220
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
precision damage with certain specific
 

221
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,230
precision damage with certain specific
weapons that have the non-lethal trait.

222
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
weapons that have the non-lethal trait.
 

223
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,670
weapons that have the non-lethal trait.
So that might be something you're

224
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
So that might be something you're
 

225
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,189
So that might be something you're
looking for if you want to do this

226
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
looking for if you want to do this
 

227
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,749
looking for if you want to do this
non-lethal damage. And the same is going

228
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
non-lethal damage. And the same is going
 

229
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,270
non-lethal damage. And the same is going
to be true for spells. A a very very few

230
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
to be true for spells. A a very very few
 

231
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,270
to be true for spells. A a very very few
spells have the non-lethal trait, but

232
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
spells have the non-lethal trait, but
 

233
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,070
spells have the non-lethal trait, but
there are a few primarily days and

234
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
there are a few primarily days and
 

235
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,189
there are a few primarily days and
phantom pain. Both of those spells have

236
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
phantom pain. Both of those spells have
 

237
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,510
phantom pain. Both of those spells have
the non-lethal trait and deal non-lethal

238
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
the non-lethal trait and deal non-lethal
 

239
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,230
the non-lethal trait and deal non-lethal
damage. Uh, and so that would work just

240
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
damage. Uh, and so that would work just
 

241
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,150
damage. Uh, and so that would work just
like making a non-lethal damage attack

242
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
like making a non-lethal damage attack
 

243
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,710
like making a non-lethal damage attack
with a non-lethal weapon. If if the

244
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
with a non-lethal weapon. If if the
 

245
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,070
with a non-lethal weapon. If if the
damage imposed by days or phantom pain

246
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
damage imposed by days or phantom pain
 

247
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,469
damage imposed by days or phantom pain
reduces a target to zero hit points,

248
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
reduces a target to zero hit points,
 

249
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,790
reduces a target to zero hit points,
they would fall unconscious and not get

250
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
they would fall unconscious and not get
 

251
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,270
they would fall unconscious and not get
the dying condition. And although it's

252
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
the dying condition. And although it's
 

253
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,029
the dying condition. And although it's
not strictly spelled out, I don't

254
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
not strictly spelled out, I don't
 

255
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,029
not strictly spelled out, I don't
believe I at least I haven't seen it

256
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
believe I at least I haven't seen it
 

257
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,430
believe I at least I haven't seen it
strictly spelled out, I believe the

258
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
strictly spelled out, I believe the
 

259
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,430
strictly spelled out, I believe the
possible persistent damage that is

260
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
possible persistent damage that is
 

261
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,670
possible persistent damage that is
provided by phantom paint would also be

262
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
provided by phantom paint would also be
 

263
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,510
provided by phantom paint would also be
non-lethal.

264
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
non-lethal.
 

265
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,350
non-lethal.
Uh, so those are the primary ways of

266
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
Uh, so those are the primary ways of
 

267
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,430
Uh, so those are the primary ways of
dealing non-lethal damage with a weapon

268
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
dealing non-lethal damage with a weapon
 

269
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,950
dealing non-lethal damage with a weapon
with a non-lethal trait that's designed

270
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
with a non-lethal trait that's designed
 

271
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,150
with a non-lethal trait that's designed
to do non-lethal damage. Your sap, your

272
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
to do non-lethal damage. Your sap, your
 

273
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,990
to do non-lethal damage. Your sap, your
fist, a whip, or with spells that have

274
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
fist, a whip, or with spells that have
 

275
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,550
fist, a whip, or with spells that have
the non-lethal trait, days, phantom

276
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
the non-lethal trait, days, phantom
 

277
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,150
the non-lethal trait, days, phantom
pain, and there might be a few others

278
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
pain, and there might be a few others
 

279
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,029
pain, and there might be a few others
that I'm not aware of.

280
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
that I'm not aware of.
 

281
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,189
that I'm not aware of.
Now, that doesn't mean that you can't

282
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
Now, that doesn't mean that you can't
 

283
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,230
Now, that doesn't mean that you can't
also make a non-lethal attack with a

284
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
also make a non-lethal attack with a
 

285
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,909
also make a non-lethal attack with a
traditional standard lethal weapon.

286
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
traditional standard lethal weapon.
 

287
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,029
traditional standard lethal weapon.
Any regular weapon, be it a mace, an

288
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
Any regular weapon, be it a mace, an
 

289
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,950
Any regular weapon, be it a mace, an
axe, a long sword, whatever, a long bow,

290
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
axe, a long sword, whatever, a long bow,
 

291
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,150
axe, a long sword, whatever, a long bow,
can deal non-lethal damage if you are

292
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
can deal non-lethal damage if you are
 

293
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,870
can deal non-lethal damage if you are
willing to take a -2 circumstance

294
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
willing to take a -2 circumstance
 

295
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,270
willing to take a -2 circumstance
penalty to that attack.

296
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
penalty to that attack.
 

297
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,990
penalty to that attack.
So, this could be you've got your sword

298
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
So, this could be you've got your sword
 

299
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,629
So, this could be you've got your sword
and so slashing with your your blade.

300
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
and so slashing with your your blade.
 

301
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,749
and so slashing with your your blade.
You're going to take a pommel and you're

302
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
You're going to take a pommel and you're
 

303
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,950
You're going to take a pommel and you're
going to smack someone in the forehead

304
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
going to smack someone in the forehead
 

305
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,110
going to smack someone in the forehead
with the pommel in hopes of knocking

306
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
with the pommel in hopes of knocking
 

307
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,749
with the pommel in hopes of knocking
them unconscious. That might be one way

308
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
them unconscious. That might be one way
 

309
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,430
them unconscious. That might be one way
that you do a non-lethal damage attack

310
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
that you do a non-lethal damage attack
 

311
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,270
that you do a non-lethal damage attack
while using a long sword. Uh the damage

312
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
while using a long sword. Uh the damage
 

313
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,270
while using a long sword. Uh the damage
itself is not changed. It would do the

314
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
itself is not changed. It would do the
 

315
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,909
itself is not changed. It would do the
same damage as normal. it would have a

316
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
same damage as normal. it would have a
 

317
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,749
same damage as normal. it would have a
negative two circumstance penalty to the

318
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
negative two circumstance penalty to the
 

319
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,909
negative two circumstance penalty to the
attack because you're using your weapon

320
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
attack because you're using your weapon
 

321
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,270
attack because you're using your weapon
in a way that it was not designed to be

322
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
in a way that it was not designed to be
 

323
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,469
in a way that it was not designed to be
used. Sort of like making an improvised

324
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
used. Sort of like making an improvised
 

325
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,710
used. Sort of like making an improvised
attack, an improvised weapon attack. But

326
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
attack, an improvised weapon attack. But
 

327
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,990
attack, an improvised weapon attack. But
if it hits, it does the exact same

328
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
if it hits, it does the exact same
 

329
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,350
if it hits, it does the exact same
damage. It just has the non-lethal

330
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
damage. It just has the non-lethal
 

331
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,270
damage. It just has the non-lethal
trait. And if that's the hit that lowers

332
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
trait. And if that's the hit that lowers
 

333
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,790
trait. And if that's the hit that lowers
the target to zero hit points, it would

334
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
the target to zero hit points, it would
 

335
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,230
the target to zero hit points, it would
not kill them. It would knock them

336
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
not kill them. It would knock them
 

337
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,189
not kill them. It would knock them
unconscious. Axe, turn it sideways, use

338
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
unconscious. Axe, turn it sideways, use
 

339
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,029
unconscious. Axe, turn it sideways, use
the flat of the blade, smack somebody in

340
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
the flat of the blade, smack somebody in
 

341
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,670
the flat of the blade, smack somebody in
the head, and so on.

342
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
the head, and so on.
 

343
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,390
the head, and so on.
Um, it's worth mentioning that there are

344
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
Um, it's worth mentioning that there are
 

345
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,670
Um, it's worth mentioning that there are
a couple of feats that grant a better

346
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
a couple of feats that grant a better
 

347
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,550
a couple of feats that grant a better
access to making non-lethal attacks with

348
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
access to making non-lethal attacks with
 

349
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,029
access to making non-lethal attacks with
regular weapons. Uh, I know

350
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
regular weapons. Uh, I know
 

351
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,110
regular weapons. Uh, I know
investigators can take the take down

352
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
investigators can take the take down
 

353
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,150
investigators can take the take down
expert feat that lets them make or lets

354
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
expert feat that lets them make or lets
 

355
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,670
expert feat that lets them make or lets
them deal non-lethal damage with pretty

356
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
them deal non-lethal damage with pretty
 

357
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,230
them deal non-lethal damage with pretty
much all of their weapon attacks without

358
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
much all of their weapon attacks without
 

359
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,870
much all of their weapon attacks without
suffering that negative two penalty. And

360
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
suffering that negative two penalty. And
 

361
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,990
suffering that negative two penalty. And
uh gladiators uh the gladiator archetype

362
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
uh gladiators uh the gladiator archetype
 

363
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,309
uh gladiators uh the gladiator archetype
can take the stage fighting feat that

364
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
can take the stage fighting feat that
 

365
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,790
can take the stage fighting feat that
does basically the same thing. List them

366
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
does basically the same thing. List them
 

367
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,110
does basically the same thing. List them
make non-lethal damage attacks with

368
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
make non-lethal damage attacks with
 

369
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,909
make non-lethal damage attacks with
regular weapons without suffering the -2

370
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
regular weapons without suffering the -2
 

371
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,510
regular weapons without suffering the -2
penalty. Also, it may be worth

372
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
penalty. Also, it may be worth
 

373
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,430
penalty. Also, it may be worth
mentioning that the opposite is kind of

374
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
mentioning that the opposite is kind of
 

375
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,950
mentioning that the opposite is kind of
true. You can take a non-lethal weapon

376
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
true. You can take a non-lethal weapon
 

377
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,670
true. You can take a non-lethal weapon
and deal lethal damage with it by

378
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
and deal lethal damage with it by
 

379
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,230
and deal lethal damage with it by
suffering a negative two penalty. So, if

380
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
suffering a negative two penalty. So, if
 

381
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,550
suffering a negative two penalty. So, if
you've got a sap and you want to deal

382
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
you've got a sap and you want to deal
 

383
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,029
you've got a sap and you want to deal
lethal damage with it, you can do so.

384
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
lethal damage with it, you can do so.
 

385
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,270
lethal damage with it, you can do so.
You suffer a negative two penalty, but

386
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
You suffer a negative two penalty, but
 

387
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,469
You suffer a negative two penalty, but
you uh but you deal lethal damage and

388
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
you uh but you deal lethal damage and
 

389
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,070
you uh but you deal lethal damage and
you could potentially kill somebody with

390
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
you could potentially kill somebody with
 

391
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,469
you could potentially kill somebody with
that strike. I would say like, you know,

392
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
that strike. I would say like, you know,
 

393
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,309
that strike. I would say like, you know,
you're you're taking the negative2

394
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
you're you're taking the negative2
 

395
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,830
you're you're taking the negative2
penalty because you're specifically

396
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
penalty because you're specifically
 

397
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,589
penalty because you're specifically
trying to hit them in the throat with

398
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
trying to hit them in the throat with
 

399
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,990
trying to hit them in the throat with
it. Something like that would be the

400
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
it. Something like that would be the
 

401
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,190
it. Something like that would be the
narrative explanation for why that that

402
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
narrative explanation for why that that
 

403
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,310
narrative explanation for why that that
works. Now, there is no such provision.

404
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
works. Now, there is no such provision.
 

405
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,829
works. Now, there is no such provision.
uh there is no such broad provision for

406
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
uh there is no such broad provision for
 

407
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,430
uh there is no such broad provision for
spells. So even though you can take a a

408
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
spells. So even though you can take a a
 

409
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,509
spells. So even though you can take a a
long sword and suffer a negative -2

410
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
long sword and suffer a negative -2
 

411
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,990
long sword and suffer a negative -2
penalty to deal non-lethal damage with

412
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
penalty to deal non-lethal damage with
 

413
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,470
penalty to deal non-lethal damage with
it, you cannot just take a negative -2

414
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
it, you cannot just take a negative -2
 

415
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,110
it, you cannot just take a negative -2
penalty to a spell that makes a spell

416
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
penalty to a spell that makes a spell
 

417
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,630
penalty to a spell that makes a spell
attack and turn it into non-lethal

418
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
attack and turn it into non-lethal
 

419
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,630
attack and turn it into non-lethal
damage. But uh there are some things you

420
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
damage. But uh there are some things you
 

421
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,070
damage. But uh there are some things you
can do which we'll talk about in just a

422
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
can do which we'll talk about in just a
 

423
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,630
can do which we'll talk about in just a
moment. So I also want to talk a little

424
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
moment. So I also want to talk a little
 

425
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,230
moment. So I also want to talk a little
bit about immunity to non-lethal damage.

426
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
bit about immunity to non-lethal damage.
 

427
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,870
bit about immunity to non-lethal damage.
Some creatures, especially things like

428
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
Some creatures, especially things like
 

429
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,990
Some creatures, especially things like
golems, have immunity to non-lethal

430
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
golems, have immunity to non-lethal
 

431
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,949
golems, have immunity to non-lethal
damage. And the example in the book is

432
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
damage. And the example in the book is
 

433
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,710
damage. And the example in the book is
is basically it doesn't matter how hard

434
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
is basically it doesn't matter how hard
 

435
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,630
is basically it doesn't matter how hard
you're punching a tank with your bare

436
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
you're punching a tank with your bare
 

437
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,829
you're punching a tank with your bare
fist, you're not going to deal, you

438
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
fist, you're not going to deal, you
 

439
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,110
fist, you're not going to deal, you
know, you're not going to incapacitate

440
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
know, you're not going to incapacitate
 

441
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,750
know, you're not going to incapacitate
it, right? And that's basically the

442
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
it, right? And that's basically the
 

443
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,870
it, right? And that's basically the
immunity that uh creatures like

444
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
immunity that uh creatures like
 

445
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,230
immunity that uh creatures like
constructs that specifically have

446
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
constructs that specifically have
 

447
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,389
constructs that specifically have
immunity to non-lethal damage. um

448
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
immunity to non-lethal damage. um
 

449
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,630
immunity to non-lethal damage. um
the the benefit that they have. You're

450
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
the the benefit that they have. You're
 

451
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,949
the the benefit that they have. You're
you're you're never going to kill an

452
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
you're you're never going to kill an

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,269
you're you're never going to kill an
iron golem by punching it with

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
iron golem by punching it with
 

455
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,790
iron golem by punching it with
non-lethal damage. If you want to uh

456
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
non-lethal damage. If you want to uh
 

457
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,670
non-lethal damage. If you want to uh
destroy the constructs with lethal

458
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
destroy the constructs with lethal
 

459
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,509
destroy the constructs with lethal
damage, you would have to suffer the

460
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
damage, you would have to suffer the
 

461
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,470
damage, you would have to suffer the
negative -2 penalty to turn your

462
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
negative -2 penalty to turn your
 

463
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,509
negative -2 penalty to turn your
non-lethal attacks lethal or use regular

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,030
non-lethal attacks lethal or use regular
lethal weapons and lethal means. Now, uh

466
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
lethal weapons and lethal means. Now, uh
 

467
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,310
lethal weapons and lethal means. Now, uh
there are a number of different

468
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
there are a number of different
 

469
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,630
there are a number of different
questions. Um, some of these came from

479
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,030
think one or two of them I also noticed
just from research on the net. But let's

480
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
just from research on the net. But let's
 

481
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,310
just from research on the net. But let's
take a look at some of these uh

482
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
take a look at some of these uh
 

483
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,710
take a look at some of these uh
questions that come up. Can a spell

484
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
questions that come up. Can a spell
 

485
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,550
questions that come up. Can a spell
without the non-lethal trait be made

486
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
without the non-lethal trait be made
 

487
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,190
without the non-lethal trait be made
non-lethal? Again, no. Not there's not

488
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
non-lethal? Again, no. Not there's not
 

489
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,230
non-lethal? Again, no. Not there's not
like a blanket rule like there is with

490
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
like a blanket rule like there is with
 

491
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,910
like a blanket rule like there is with
with weapons being used to do non lethal

492
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
with weapons being used to do non lethal
 

493
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,269
with weapons being used to do non lethal
damage, but there is a wizard feat

494
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
damage, but there is a wizard feat
 

495
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,630
damage, but there is a wizard feat
called the non-lethal spell feat that uh

496
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
called the non-lethal spell feat that uh
 

497
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,430
called the non-lethal spell feat that uh
it takes one action, you cast it, and if

498
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
it takes one action, you cast it, and if
 

499
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,910
it takes one action, you cast it, and if
the following action is to cast a spell

500
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
the following action is to cast a spell
 

501
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,110
the following action is to cast a spell
that does not have the the death or void

502
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
that does not have the the death or void
 

503
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,269
that does not have the the death or void
traits, then that uh spell gains the

504
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
traits, then that uh spell gains the
 

505
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,590
traits, then that uh spell gains the
non-lethal trait and deals non-lethal

506
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
non-lethal trait and deals non-lethal
 

507
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,790
non-lethal trait and deals non-lethal
damage.

508
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
damage.
 

509
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,910
damage.
So, um, this could turn your force

510
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
So, um, this could turn your force
 

511
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,389
So, um, this could turn your force
barrage, the oldfashioned magic missile,

512
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
barrage, the oldfashioned magic missile,
 

513
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,630
barrage, the oldfashioned magic missile,
maybe they're now stunbolts. You've

514
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
maybe they're now stunbolts. You've
 

515
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,870
maybe they're now stunbolts. You've
customized the spell as you're casting

516
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
customized the spell as you're casting
 

517
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,150
customized the spell as you're casting
it by spinning an extra action. Uh, you

518
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
it by spinning an extra action. Uh, you
 

519
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,190
it by spinning an extra action. Uh, you
know, some people say, "Well, wait a

520
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
know, some people say, "Well, wait a
 

521
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,389
know, some people say, "Well, wait a
second. What about fireball? How do you

522
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
second. What about fireball? How do you
 

523
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,870
second. What about fireball? How do you
turn a fireball non-lethal?" Well, maybe

524
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
turn a fireball non-lethal?" Well, maybe
 

525
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,269
turn a fireball non-lethal?" Well, maybe
the fireball becomes a concussive blast

526
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
the fireball becomes a concussive blast
 

527
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,470
the fireball becomes a concussive blast
with a bright bright light. It no longer

528
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
with a bright bright light. It no longer
 

529
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,110
with a bright bright light. It no longer
does lethal damage, but it's basically a

530
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
does lethal damage, but it's basically a
 

531
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,910
does lethal damage, but it's basically a
giant modern-day flashbang, you know,

532
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
giant modern-day flashbang, you know,
 

533
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,470
giant modern-day flashbang, you know,
that that police might use to clear a

534
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
that that police might use to clear a
 

535
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,670
that that police might use to clear a
room uh and stun people in it before

536
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
room uh and stun people in it before
 

537
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,030
room uh and stun people in it before
they come in. Uh you're you're you're

538
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
they come in. Uh you're you're you're
 

539
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,870
they come in. Uh you're you're you're
adjusting and changing the the magic

540
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
adjusting and changing the the magic
 

541
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,230
adjusting and changing the the magic
involved, the weave and the magic and

542
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
involved, the weave and the magic and
 

543
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,670
involved, the weave and the magic and
the spell wire, casting of that extra

544
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
the spell wire, casting of that extra
 

545
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,829
the spell wire, casting of that extra
direction to make it non-lethal. This

546
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
direction to make it non-lethal. This
 

547
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,590
direction to make it non-lethal. This
this may be a situation where you have

548
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
this may be a situation where you have
 

549
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,630
this may be a situation where you have
to lean a little bit on roleplaying the

550
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
to lean a little bit on roleplaying the
 

551
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,110
to lean a little bit on roleplaying the
result, see what the result of the spell

552
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
result, see what the result of the spell
 

553
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,230
result, see what the result of the spell
is, and then tailor the narrative to fit

554
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
is, and then tailor the narrative to fit
 

555
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,949
is, and then tailor the narrative to fit
that. But mechanically,

556
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
that. But mechanically,
 

557
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,870
that. But mechanically,
uh, you know, like would the fireball

558
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
uh, you know, like would the fireball
 

559
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,269
uh, you know, like would the fireball
still do fire damage? By raw,

560
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
still do fire damage? By raw,
 

561
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,949
still do fire damage? By raw,
mechanically, yes. It's still doing fire

562
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
mechanically, yes. It's still doing fire
 

563
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,150
mechanically, yes. It's still doing fire
damage. It's just doing non-lethal fire

564
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
damage. It's just doing non-lethal fire
 

565
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,230
damage. It's just doing non-lethal fire
damage. Now, what mental gymnastics has

566
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
damage. Now, what mental gymnastics has
 

567
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,230
damage. Now, what mental gymnastics has
to go along in the narrative to make

568
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
to go along in the narrative to make
 

569
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,949
to go along in the narrative to make
sense of that is going to be up to the

570
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
sense of that is going to be up to the
 

571
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,829
sense of that is going to be up to the
GM and the players to figure out. Uh me,

572
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
GM and the players to figure out. Uh me,
 

573
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,430
GM and the players to figure out. Uh me,
I probably would no longer call it fire

574
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
I probably would no longer call it fire
 

575
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,069
I probably would no longer call it fire
damage. You know, I would, like I said,

576
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
damage. You know, I would, like I said,
 

577
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,990
damage. You know, I would, like I said,
I would say it's a concussive blast with

578
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
I would say it's a concussive blast with
 

579
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,310
I would say it's a concussive blast with
a bright light or whatever. That would

580
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
a bright light or whatever. That would
 

581
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,750
a bright light or whatever. That would
still do the same thing. The only the

582
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
still do the same thing. The only the
 

583
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,230
still do the same thing. The only the
only problem would be if uh you're using

584
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
only problem would be if uh you're using
 

585
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,470
only problem would be if uh you're using
that fireball to deal non-lethal damage

586
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
that fireball to deal non-lethal damage
 

587
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,870
that fireball to deal non-lethal damage
against a target that is weak to fire.

588
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
against a target that is weak to fire.
 

589
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,949
against a target that is weak to fire.
Uh in those cases, they would still take

590
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
Uh in those cases, they would still take
 

591
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,710
Uh in those cases, they would still take
the their weakness would still be

592
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
the their weakness would still be
 

593
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,470
the their weakness would still be
triggered. They would still take that

594
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
triggered. They would still take that
 

595
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,949
triggered. They would still take that
extra damage. Um but and it is still

596
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
extra damage. Um but and it is still
 

597
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,790
extra damage. Um but and it is still
fire damage. It's just non-lethal.

598
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
fire damage. It's just non-lethal.
 

599
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,870
fire damage. It's just non-lethal.
So, I I'm I'm the first to say that

600
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
So, I I'm I'm the first to say that
 

601
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,509
So, I I'm I'm the first to say that
there's there may be some some give and

602
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
there's there may be some some give and
 

603
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,750
there's there may be some some give and
take between, you know, the players and

604
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
take between, you know, the players and
 

605
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,430
take between, you know, the players and
the GM to figure figure out what makes

606
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
the GM to figure figure out what makes
 

607
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,350
the GM to figure figure out what makes
most sense in the narrative to make this

608
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
most sense in the narrative to make this
 

609
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,269
most sense in the narrative to make this
work. But rules is written. What the

610
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
work. But rules is written. What the
 

611
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,310
work. But rules is written. What the
rules say is that it just gains the

612
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
rules say is that it just gains the
 

613
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,470
rules say is that it just gains the
non-lethal trait. And all that

614
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
non-lethal trait. And all that
 

615
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,150
non-lethal trait. And all that
non-lethal trait means is if you reduce

616
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
non-lethal trait means is if you reduce
 

617
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,870
non-lethal trait means is if you reduce
the target to zero, then they fall

618
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
the target to zero, then they fall
 

619
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,509
the target to zero, then they fall
unconscious instead of dying. everything

620
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
unconscious instead of dying. everything
 

621
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,069
unconscious instead of dying. everything
else is the same. Still fire damage,

622
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
else is the same. Still fire damage,
 

623
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,590
else is the same. Still fire damage,
still triggers fire weaknesses or

624
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
still triggers fire weaknesses or
 

625
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,949
still triggers fire weaknesses or
whatever. Um, it just would not kill

626
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
whatever. Um, it just would not kill
 

627
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,030
whatever. Um, it just would not kill
somebody. But I agree, you may have to

628
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
somebody. But I agree, you may have to
 

629
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,710
somebody. But I agree, you may have to
do a little bit of a little bit of work

630
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
do a little bit of a little bit of work
 

631
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,470
do a little bit of a little bit of work
to figure out how to make that work in

632
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
to figure out how to make that work in
 

633
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,870
to figure out how to make that work in
the narrative. Um, likewise, there's the

634
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
the narrative. Um, likewise, there's the
 

635
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,150
the narrative. Um, likewise, there's the
question about like the disintegrate

636
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
question about like the disintegrate
 

637
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,110
question about like the disintegrate
spell. So, what happens here? Um,

638
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
spell. So, what happens here? Um,
 

639
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,750
spell. So, what happens here? Um,
can you use the uh wizard's uh

640
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
can you use the uh wizard's uh
 

641
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,150
can you use the uh wizard's uh
non-lethal spell feat to cast a

642
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
non-lethal spell feat to cast a
 

643
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,110
non-lethal spell feat to cast a
non-lethal disintegrate spell? Yeah, you

644
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
non-lethal disintegrate spell? Yeah, you
 

645
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,430
non-lethal disintegrate spell? Yeah, you
can. So, what happens when that reduces

646
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
can. So, what happens when that reduces
 

647
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,590
can. So, what happens when that reduces
a person to to zero hit points? Does it

648
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
a person to to zero hit points? Does it
 

649
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,750
a person to to zero hit points? Does it
turn them to dust like it says in the

650
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
turn them to dust like it says in the
 

651
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,069
turn them to dust like it says in the
description of the spell, or do they

652
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
description of the spell, or do they
 

653
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,949
description of the spell, or do they
just fall unconscious?

654
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
just fall unconscious?
 

655
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,030
just fall unconscious?
Personally, as a GM, I would I would

656
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
Personally, as a GM, I would I would
 

657
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,790
Personally, as a GM, I would I would
lean on whatever the cer's intent is. If

658
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
lean on whatever the cer's intent is. If
 

659
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,550
lean on whatever the cer's intent is. If
a player spends the effort to make their

660
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
a player spends the effort to make their
 

661
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,030
a player spends the effort to make their
disintegrate spell non-lethal,

662
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
disintegrate spell non-lethal,
 

663
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,870
disintegrate spell non-lethal,
I I I would just have it knock the

664
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
I I I would just have it knock the
 

665
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,750
I I I would just have it knock the
person out. You know, it is clear that

666
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
person out. You know, it is clear that
 

667
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,350
person out. You know, it is clear that
that is what they're trying to

668
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
that is what they're trying to
 

669
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,790
that is what they're trying to
accomplish. Let's not penalize them for

670
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
accomplish. Let's not penalize them for
 

671
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,430
accomplish. Let's not penalize them for
rolling too well. Um if if if they're

672
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
rolling too well. Um if if if they're
 

673
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,030
rolling too well. Um if if if they're
taking the time to spend the extra

674
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
taking the time to spend the extra
 

675
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,470
taking the time to spend the extra
action on that feed to make it

676
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
action on that feed to make it
 

677
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,269
action on that feed to make it
non-lethal, just let it knock them out.

678
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
non-lethal, just let it knock them out.
 

679
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,990
non-lethal, just let it knock them out.
But as always, uh, GMs are always going

685
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,990

I also want to mention that, uh, in the

Agents of Edge adventure path, there is

688
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
Agents of Edge adventure path, there is
 

689
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,110
Agents of Edge adventure path, there is
a blanket rule that basically says that

690
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
a blanket rule that basically says that
 

691
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,670
a blanket rule that basically says that
the assumption in this campaign is that

692
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
the assumption in this campaign is that
 

693
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,069
the assumption in this campaign is that
players are doing non-lethal damage as

694
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
players are doing non-lethal damage as
 

695
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,069
players are doing non-lethal damage as
opposed to the regular assumption that

696
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
opposed to the regular assumption that
 

697
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,750
opposed to the regular assumption that
they're doing lethal damage. So, in that

698
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
they're doing lethal damage. So, in that
 

699
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,829
they're doing lethal damage. So, in that
adventure path, because the players are

700
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
adventure path, because the players are
 

701
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,230
adventure path, because the players are
supposed to be city guards who have had

702
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
supposed to be city guards who have had
 

703
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,230
supposed to be city guards who have had
extra training on how to subdue and

704
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
extra training on how to subdue and
 

705
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,550
extra training on how to subdue and
capture their targets,

706
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
capture their targets,
 

707
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,590
capture their targets,
all of their damage, even spell damage,

708
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
all of their damage, even spell damage,
 

709
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,790
all of their damage, even spell damage,
even poison damage, all damage period,

710
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
even poison damage, all damage period,
 

711
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,949
even poison damage, all damage period,
is non-lethal.

712
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
is non-lethal.
 

713
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,629
is non-lethal.
And again, that's another place where

714
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
And again, that's another place where
 

715
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,389
And again, that's another place where
you might have to do some work and some

716
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
you might have to do some work and some
 

717
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,030
you might have to do some work and some
give and take to to figure out exactly

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
give and take to to figure out exactly
 

719
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,590
give and take to to figure out exactly
how within the narrative that works. But

720
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
how within the narrative that works. But
 

721
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,629
how within the narrative that works. But
that's the rule. Uh that is not a feat

722
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
that's the rule. Uh that is not a feat
 

723
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,189
that's the rule. Uh that is not a feat
that people outside of that campaign can

00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
that people outside of that campaign can
 

725
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,750
that people outside of that campaign can
just take. But GMs just know like

726
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:33,760
just take. But GMs just know like
 

727
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,829
just take. But GMs just know like
there's a precedent that exists for just

there's a precedent that exists for just

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,389
there's a precedent that exists for just
having a blanket statement that says I

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399

It's in the players guide. Um, also, uh,

740
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
It's in the players guide. Um, also, uh,
 

741
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,949
It's in the players guide. Um, also, uh,

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
infusions action that works very much
 

751
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,749
infusions action that works very much
the same way as the wizard's non-lethal

752
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
the same way as the wizard's non-lethal
 

753
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,990
the same way as the wizard's non-lethal
spell feat. They spend that action and

754
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
spell feat. They spend that action and
 

755
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,590
spell feat. They spend that action and
then that turns their next impulse into

756
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
then that turns their next impulse into
 

757
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,509
then that turns their next impulse into
a non-lethal damaging ability.

758
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
a non-lethal damaging ability.
 

759
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,910
a non-lethal damaging ability.
So, another question that comes up is,

760
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
So, another question that comes up is,
 

761
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,749
So, another question that comes up is,
what if 99% of the damage is lethal? So,

762
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
what if 99% of the damage is lethal? So,
 

763
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,910
what if 99% of the damage is lethal? So,
we've been we've been stabbing this this

764
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
we've been we've been stabbing this this
 

765
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,030
we've been we've been stabbing this this
this target with swords and then someone

766
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
this target with swords and then someone
 

767
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,189
this target with swords and then someone
walks up with their bare knuckle fist

768
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
walks up with their bare knuckle fist
 

769
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,189
walks up with their bare knuckle fist
and punches them and that does

770
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
and punches them and that does
 

771
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,110
and punches them and that does
non-lethal damage and that's the final

772
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
non-lethal damage and that's the final
 

773
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,310
non-lethal damage and that's the final
hit that reduces them to zero. Um, does

774
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
hit that reduces them to zero. Um, does
 

775
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,990
hit that reduces them to zero. Um, does
it make sense for them to fall

776
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
it make sense for them to fall
 

777
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,790
it make sense for them to fall
unconscious when prior to that we've

778
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
unconscious when prior to that we've
 

779
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,749
unconscious when prior to that we've
been stabbing them repeatedly?

780
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
been stabbing them repeatedly?
 

781
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,189
been stabbing them repeatedly?
So, a lot of that's going to come down

So, a lot of that's going to come down

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,269
edition has tried to streamline rules
and make them as easy as possible with

794
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
and make them as easy as possible with
 

795
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,629
and make them as easy as possible with
the understanding that there is a

796
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
the understanding that there is a
 

797
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,350
the understanding that there is a
living, breathing GM there who can

798
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
living, breathing GM there who can
 

799
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,750
living, breathing GM there who can
intervene and say, but in this case, I

800
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
intervene and say, but in this case, I
 

801
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,270
intervene and say, but in this case, I
don't think that rule is going to apply

802
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
don't think that rule is going to apply
 

803
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,750
don't think that rule is going to apply
or this is how we're going to twist it.

804
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
or this is how we're going to twist it.
 

805
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,350
or this is how we're going to twist it.
That's the direction they've gone with

806
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
That's the direction they've gone with
 

807
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,590
That's the direction they've gone with
second edition as opposed to having a

808
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
second edition as opposed to having a
 

809
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,949
second edition as opposed to having a
lot of uh a lot of extra bookkeeping.

810
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
lot of uh a lot of extra bookkeeping.
 

811
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,789
lot of uh a lot of extra bookkeeping.
Like I I believe in in Pathfinder first

812
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
Like I I believe in in Pathfinder first
 

813
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,189
Like I I believe in in Pathfinder first
edition, you had to keep track of how

814
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
edition, you had to keep track of how
 

815
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,710
edition, you had to keep track of how
much damage was lethal and how much

816
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
much damage was lethal and how much
 

817
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,029
much damage was lethal and how much
damage was non-lethal. And there you had

818
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
damage was non-lethal. And there you had
 

819
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,309
damage was non-lethal. And there you had
to keep track of those two totals and

820
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
to keep track of those two totals and
 

821
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,549
to keep track of those two totals and
non-lethal damage healed at a faster

822
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
non-lethal damage healed at a faster
 

823
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,789
non-lethal damage healed at a faster
rate than than lethal damage. And

824
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
rate than than lethal damage. And
 

825
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,789
rate than than lethal damage. And
there's all these different rules that

826
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
there's all these different rules that
 

827
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,270
there's all these different rules that
doesn't exist in second edition.

828
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
doesn't exist in second edition.
 

829
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,669
doesn't exist in second edition.
By raw, all that matters is that last

830
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
By raw, all that matters is that last
 

831
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,430
By raw, all that matters is that last
hit that lowers them to zero hit points.

832
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
hit that lowers them to zero hit points.
 

833
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,029
hit that lowers them to zero hit points.
Um, so what happens if you do 99% of the

834
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
Um, so what happens if you do 99% of the
 

835
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,190
Um, so what happens if you do 99% of the
damage lethal and the last 1%

836
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
damage lethal and the last 1%
 

837
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,710
damage lethal and the last 1%
non-lethal?

838
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
non-lethal?
 

839
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,990
non-lethal?
The same as if you had done all the

840
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
The same as if you had done all the
 

841
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,430
The same as if you had done all the
damage as non-lethal. They fall

842
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
damage as non-lethal. They fall
 

843
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,710
damage as non-lethal. They fall
unconscious instead of dying by raw. Um,

844
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
unconscious instead of dying by raw. Um,
 

845
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,350
unconscious instead of dying by raw. Um,
also keep in mind that hit points hit

846
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
also keep in mind that hit points hit
 

847
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,830
also keep in mind that hit points hit
points don't represent how much blood is

848
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
points don't represent how much blood is
 

849
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,789
points don't represent how much blood is
in your body. Hit points represent your

850
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
in your body. Hit points represent your
 

851
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,870
in your body. Hit points represent your
ability to avoid dying.

852
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
ability to avoid dying.
 

853
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,430
ability to avoid dying.
So that 99% of lethal damage could have

854
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
So that 99% of lethal damage could have
 

855
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,710
So that 99% of lethal damage could have
been represented by you ducking,

856
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
been represented by you ducking,
 

857
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,870
been represented by you ducking,
dodging, taking minor cuts, uh

858
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
dodging, taking minor cuts, uh
 

859
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,029
dodging, taking minor cuts, uh
exhausting yourself by constantly having

860
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
exhausting yourself by constantly having
 

861
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,909
exhausting yourself by constantly having
to parry away a an otherwise lethal

862
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
to parry away a an otherwise lethal
 

863
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,630
to parry away a an otherwise lethal
attack at the very last second. And that

864
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
attack at the very last second. And that
 

865
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,590
attack at the very last second. And that
that exhausts you and wears you down.

866
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
that exhausts you and wears you down.
 

867
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,590
that exhausts you and wears you down.
Uh, so a lot of it comes down to how you

868
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
Uh, so a lot of it comes down to how you
 

869
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,350
Uh, so a lot of it comes down to how you
are describing the damage within the

870
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
are describing the damage within the
 

871
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,990
are describing the damage within the
narration. If you've been describing it

872
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
narration. If you've been describing it
 

873
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,390
narration. If you've been describing it
as you're literally running the person

874
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
as you're literally running the person
 

875
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,390
as you're literally running the person
through with a sword 20 times leading up

876
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
through with a sword 20 times leading up
 

877
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,630
through with a sword 20 times leading up
to that last hit, that's a little

878
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
to that last hit, that's a little
 

879
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,230
to that last hit, that's a little
different.

880
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
different.
 

881
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,549
different.
But, uh, bottom line, official rule, all

882
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
But, uh, bottom line, official rule, all
 

883
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,029
But, uh, bottom line, official rule, all
that matters is that very last hit. And

884
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
that matters is that very last hit. And
 

885
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,710
that matters is that very last hit. And
again, GMs can choose to rule

886
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
again, GMs can choose to rule
 

887
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,390
again, GMs can choose to rule
differently. There may be situations

888
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
differently. There may be situations
 

889
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,029
differently. There may be situations
where you say, well, this person

890
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
where you say, well, this person
 

891
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,029
where you say, well, this person
suffered all this lethal damage and the

892
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
suffered all this lethal damage and the
 

893
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,190
suffered all this lethal damage and the
last hit was non-lethal.

894
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
last hit was non-lethal.
 

895
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,630
last hit was non-lethal.
find a way to work with your players. Uh

896
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
find a way to work with your players. Uh
 

897
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,750
find a way to work with your players. Uh
maybe you say, "Yeah, they fall

898
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
maybe you say, "Yeah, they fall
 

899
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,510
maybe you say, "Yeah, they fall
unconscious,

900
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
unconscious,
 

901
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,270
unconscious,
but if you don't do something to

902
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
but if you don't do something to
 

903
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,470
but if you don't do something to
stabilize them within three rounds or

904
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
stabilize them within three rounds or
 

905
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,909
stabilize them within three rounds or
whatever you you think makes sense

906
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
whatever you you think makes sense
 

907
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,310
whatever you you think makes sense
within the narrative you've constructed,

908
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
within the narrative you've constructed,
 

909
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,070
within the narrative you've constructed,
they're going to start bleeding out and

910
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
they're going to start bleeding out and
 

911
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,190
they're going to start bleeding out and
suffer the dying condition." Um, that's

912
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
suffer the dying condition." Um, that's
 

913
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,110
suffer the dying condition." Um, that's
not a hard and fast rule. Again, these

914
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
not a hard and fast rule. Again, these
 

915
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,470
not a hard and fast rule. Again, these
are things that you can think about as a

916
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
are things that you can think about as a
 

917
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,590
are things that you can think about as a
GM to kind of find that balance between

918
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
GM to kind of find that balance between
 

919
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,150
GM to kind of find that balance between
the two extremes of the lethal damage

920
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
the two extremes of the lethal damage
 

921
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,870
the two extremes of the lethal damage
and the non-lethal situations. Another

922
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
and the non-lethal situations. Another
 

923
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,270
and the non-lethal situations. Another
question that uh comes up is what about

924
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
question that uh comes up is what about
 

925
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,230
question that uh comes up is what about
um energy damage? Uh you know, it makes

926
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
um energy damage? Uh you know, it makes
 

927
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,750
um energy damage? Uh you know, it makes
sense that if I'm pommel striking

928
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
sense that if I'm pommel striking
 

929
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,990
sense that if I'm pommel striking
somebody with my um with my sword that

930
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
somebody with my um with my sword that
 

931
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,350
somebody with my um with my sword that
it does non-lethal damage, but what if

932
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
it does non-lethal damage, but what if
 

933
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,350
it does non-lethal damage, but what if
I'm making a non-lethal attack with my

934
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm making a non-lethal attack with my
 

935
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,150
I'm making a non-lethal attack with my
flaming sword? What happens there?

936
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
flaming sword? What happens there?
 

937
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,990
flaming sword? What happens there?
Again,

938
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
Again,
 

939
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,470
Again,
just like with the earlier example of of

940
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
just like with the earlier example of of
 

941
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,710
just like with the earlier example of of
a non-lethal fireball, the same true for

942
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
a non-lethal fireball, the same true for
 

943
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,230
a non-lethal fireball, the same true for
a flaming sword or an electrified sword

944
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
a flaming sword or an electrified sword
 

945
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,549
a flaming sword or an electrified sword
or whatever, the damage becomes

946
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559
or whatever, the damage becomes
 

947
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,909
or whatever, the damage becomes
non-lethal. It still deals fire damage.

948
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
non-lethal. It still deals fire damage.
 

949
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,510
non-lethal. It still deals fire damage.
If you critically hit it, it can still

950
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
If you critically hit it, it can still
 

951
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,070
If you critically hit it, it can still
do persistent fire damage. All of this

952

damage is just nonlethal.
 

955
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,029
damage is just nonlethal.
All that mean, and that doesn't mean

956
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
All that mean, and that doesn't mean
 

957
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,110
All that mean, and that doesn't mean
anything at all, except if that damage

958
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
anything at all, except if that damage
 

959
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,750
anything at all, except if that damage
reduces the target to zero, they fall

960
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
reduces the target to zero, they fall
 

961
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,390
reduces the target to zero, they fall
unconscious instead of dying. Um, that's

962
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
unconscious instead of dying. Um, that's
 

963
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,430
unconscious instead of dying. Um, that's
the RAW as usual. GMs, you can play with

964
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
the RAW as usual. GMs, you can play with
 

965
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,630
the RAW as usual. GMs, you can play with
that however you want. Um, but just be

966
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
that however you want. Um, but just be
 

967
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,990
that however you want. Um, but just be
aware that that is the official RAW

968
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
aware that that is the official RAW
 

969
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,549
aware that that is the official RAW
ruling. Uh, and another question that

970
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
ruling. Uh, and another question that
 

971
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,950
ruling. Uh, and another question that
comes up is, okay, so I can make a

972
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
comes up is, okay, so I can make a
 

973
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,830
comes up is, okay, so I can make a
non-lethal attack with a a weapon by

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
non-lethal attack with a a weapon by
 

975

non-lethal attack with a a weapon by
suffering a negative two circumstance

976
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
suffering a negative two circumstance
 

977
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,710
suffering a negative two circumstance
penalty. Okay, I can see that with again

978
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
penalty. Okay, I can see that with again
 

979
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,149
penalty. Okay, I can see that with again
the long sword doing the pommel strike.

980
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
the long sword doing the pommel strike.
 

981
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,350
the long sword doing the pommel strike.
You can see that with taking the battle

982
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
You can see that with taking the battle
 

983
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,270
You can see that with taking the battle
axe, turning on the side, and smacking

984
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
axe, turning on the side, and smacking

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
somebody with the flat of the blade
 

987
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,590
somebody with the flat of the blade
instead of the edge of the blade. But

988
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
instead of the edge of the blade. But
 

989
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,350
instead of the edge of the blade. But
how am I making a non-lethal attack with

990
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
how am I making a non-lethal attack with
 

991
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,590
how am I making a non-lethal attack with
my long bow?

992
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
my long bow?
 

993
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,270
my long bow?
So, uh this is another one of those

994
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
So, uh this is another one of those
 

995
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,310
So, uh this is another one of those
areas where you might want to have to

996
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
areas where you might want to have to
 

997
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,470
areas where you might want to have to
lean in a little bit to um to uh

998
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
lean in a little bit to um to uh
 

999
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,630
lean in a little bit to um to uh
roleplaying the result, see what the

1000
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
roleplaying the result, see what the
 

1001
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,549
roleplaying the result, see what the
result is, and then tweaking the

1002
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
result is, and then tweaking the
 

1003
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,590
result is, and then tweaking the
narrative to match that result.

1004
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
narrative to match that result.
 

1005
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,230
narrative to match that result.
Maybe that arrow

1006
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
Maybe that arrow
 

1007
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,710
Maybe that arrow
uh didn't shoot the target. Maybe it

1008
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
uh didn't shoot the target. Maybe it
 

1009
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,270
uh didn't shoot the target. Maybe it
instead cut through a rope that's

1010
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
instead cut through a rope that's
 

1011
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,630
instead cut through a rope that's
holding a big wooden uh chandelier-l

1012
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
holding a big wooden uh chandelier-l
 

1013
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,190
holding a big wooden uh chandelier-l
like handle holder that drops on the

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
like handle holder that drops on the
 

1015
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,470
like handle holder that drops on the
target's head and knocks them

1016
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
target's head and knocks them
 

1017
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,630
target's head and knocks them
unconscious. Uh maybe that arrow uh

1018
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
unconscious. Uh maybe that arrow uh
 

1019
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,750
unconscious. Uh maybe that arrow uh
strikes their helmet in such a way where

1020
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
strikes their helmet in such a way where
 

1021
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,950
strikes their helmet in such a way where
the the arrow head does not penetrate

1022
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
the the arrow head does not penetrate
 

1023
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,110
the the arrow head does not penetrate
the skin, but it has enough force to

1024
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
the skin, but it has enough force to
 

1025
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,830
the skin, but it has enough force to
knock that helmet against their head and

1026
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
knock that helmet against their head and
 

1027
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,590
knock that helmet against their head and
concuss them. or you know, maybe it you

1028
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
concuss them. or you know, maybe it you
 

1029
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,990
concuss them. or you know, maybe it you
hit them in such a way that they stumble

1030
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
hit them in such a way that they stumble
 

1031
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,510
hit them in such a way that they stumble
back and knock their head against

something.
 

1035
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,350
something.
Again, this is an area where it's going

1036
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
Again, this is an area where it's going
 

1037
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,350
Again, this is an area where it's going
to take give and take between the GM and

1038
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
to take give and take between the GM and
 

1039
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,510
to take give and take between the GM and
the players to craft a narrative

1040
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
the players to craft a narrative
 

1041
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,070
the players to craft a narrative
explanation that makes sense, and GMs

1042
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
explanation that makes sense, and GMs
 

1043
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,590
explanation that makes sense, and GMs
are 100% free to play with this however

1044
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
are 100% free to play with this however
 

1045
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,669
are 100% free to play with this however
they wish.

1046
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
they wish.
 

1047
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,950
they wish.
uh they can rule that you can't do

1048
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
uh they can rule that you can't do
 

1049
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,350
uh they can rule that you can't do
non-lethal damage in certain situations,

1050
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
non-lethal damage in certain situations,
 

1051
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,669
non-lethal damage in certain situations,
but again, these are what the official

1052
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
but again, these are what the official
 

1053
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,350
but again, these are what the official
rules as written say. Okay, so that was
