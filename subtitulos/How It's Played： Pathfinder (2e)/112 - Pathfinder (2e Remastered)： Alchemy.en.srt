specific video all about alchemists.
Alchemy can be thought of as sort of the

22
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
Alchemy can be thought of as sort of the
 

23
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,310
Alchemy can be thought of as sort of the
science of the Pathfinder universe. Its

24
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
science of the Pathfinder universe. Its
 

25
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,470
science of the Pathfinder universe. Its
practice is based on principles such as

26
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
practice is based on principles such as
 

27
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,790
practice is based on principles such as
chemistry, biology, and botany, but with

28
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
chemistry, biology, and botany, but with
 

29
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,990
chemistry, biology, and botany, but with
a fantasy twist. As such, alchemical

30
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
a fantasy twist. As such, alchemical
 

31
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,549
a fantasy twist. As such, alchemical
items may resemble magic items and

32
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
items may resemble magic items and
 

33
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,950
items may resemble magic items and
function in much the same way. But it's

34
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
function in much the same way. But it's
 

35
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,270
function in much the same way. But it's
important to remember that alchemy is

36
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
important to remember that alchemy is
 

37
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,990
important to remember that alchemy is
not magic. An elixir of life may

00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
not magic. An elixir of life may
 

39
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,510
not magic. An elixir of life may
function very closely to a healing

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
function very closely to a healing
 

41
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,750
function very closely to a healing
potion. And drinking liquid from a vial

feel like magic to our modern
 

47
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,470
feel like magic to our modern

sensibilities, but alchemical elixirs
 

49
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,270
sensibilities, but alchemical elixirs
are not magical. They do not register

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
And another important note regarding
 

57
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,950
And another important note regarding
alchemical items is you do not need to

58
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
alchemical items is you do not need to
 

59
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,030
alchemical items is you do not need to
be a member of the alchemist class to

60
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
be a member of the alchemist class to

use or even create alchemical items.
 

63
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,789
use or even create alchemical items.
Anyone can drink an alchemical elixir or

64
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
Anyone can drink an alchemical elixir or
 

65
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,670
Anyone can drink an alchemical elixir or
light an alchemical sunrod, not just

alchemists. The alchemical crafting feat

68
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
alchemists. The alchemical crafting feat
 

69
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,749
alchemists. The alchemical crafting feat
is required to create alchemical items.

70
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
is required to create alchemical items.
 

71
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,590
is required to create alchemical items.
This process works much the same way as

72
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
This process works much the same way as
 

73
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,990
This process works much the same way as
crafting anything else, except when you

74
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
crafting anything else, except when you
 

75
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,910
crafting anything else, except when you
critically fail a crafting check to

76
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
critically fail a crafting check to
 

77
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,390
critically fail a crafting check to
create an alchemical item, something bad

78
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
create an alchemical item, something bad

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,590
happens in addition to you losing your
spent resources as normal. The exact

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
spent resources as normal. The exact
 

83
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,670
spent resources as normal. The exact
result is up to the GM, but will usually

84
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
result is up to the GM, but will usually
 

85
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,190
result is up to the GM, but will usually
mean that the bomb you're creating

86
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
mean that the bomb you're creating
 

87
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,710
mean that the bomb you're creating
explodes in your face or you

88

explodes in your face or you
 

89
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,310
explodes in your face or you
accidentally expose yourself to

Also, it's worth noting that there is no

100
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
Also, it's worth noting that there is no
 

101
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,230
Also, it's worth noting that there is no
alchemy skill. Instead, the crafting

102
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
alchemy skill. Instead, the crafting
 

103

nature, religion, and occultism relate
to their magical traditions. meaning you

110
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
to their magical traditions. meaning you
 

111
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,670
to their magical traditions. meaning you
use the crafting skill to identify or

112
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
use the crafting skill to identify or
 

113
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,309
use the crafting skill to identify or
recall knowledge about alchemical items.

recall knowledge about alchemical items.
 

115
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,710
recall knowledge about alchemical items.
And last, most alchemical items include

And last, most alchemical items include
 

117
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,350
And last, most alchemical items include
the consumable trait, meaning they can

118
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
the consumable trait, meaning they can
 

119
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,150
the consumable trait, meaning they can
only be used once and then are lost.

120
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
only be used once and then are lost.
 

121
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,229
only be used once and then are lost.
This includes alchemical poisons and

00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
This includes alchemical poisons and
 

123
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,070
This includes alchemical poisons and
oils as well. One dose means one use.

124
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
oils as well. One dose means one use.
 

125
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,910

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,430
Let's take a closer look at each type of
alchemical item, starting with

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
alchemical item, starting with
 

129
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,390
alchemical item, starting with
alchemical bombs. Alchemical bombs are

130
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
alchemical bombs. Alchemical bombs are
 

131
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,710
alchemical bombs. Alchemical bombs are
basically Pathfinder grenades, but they

132
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
basically Pathfinder grenades, but they
 

133
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,270
basically Pathfinder grenades, but they
don't always deal damage, and they can

don't always deal damage, and they can
 

135
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,509
don't always deal damage, and they can
take many shapes and forms. Sometimes

136
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
take many shapes and forms. Sometimes
 

137
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,830
take many shapes and forms. Sometimes
they are ball-shaped grenades, but they

138
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
they are ball-shaped grenades, but they
 

139
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,550
they are ball-shaped grenades, but they
could also be glass flasks or even small

140
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
could also be glass flasks or even small
 

141
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,589
could also be glass flasks or even small
bags of goo. Regardless of shape, all

00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
bags of goo. Regardless of shape, all
 

143
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,110
bags of goo. Regardless of shape, all
bombs are distinguished from other

bombs are distinguished from other
 

145
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,830
bombs are distinguished from other
alchemical items by the bomb trait and

descriptions, all alchemical bombs are
 

153
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,630
descriptions, all alchemical bombs are
marshall ranged weapons. Bombs also have

154
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
marshall ranged weapons. Bombs also have
 

155
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,710
marshall ranged weapons. Bombs also have
a range increment of 20 feet or four

156

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,390
trait. Therefore, you do not add your
strength bonus to damage when throwing

166
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
strength bonus to damage when throwing
 

167
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,190
strength bonus to damage when throwing
an alchemical bomb. And an important

168
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
an alchemical bomb. And an important
 

169
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,430
an alchemical bomb. And an important
note to remember is since bombs have the

170
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
note to remember is since bombs have the
 

171
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,390
note to remember is since bombs have the
consumable trait, they cannot have runes

172
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
consumable trait, they cannot have runes
 

173
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,470
consumable trait, they cannot have runes
etched on them, nor can they benefit

174
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
etched on them, nor can they benefit
 

175
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,309
etched on them, nor can they benefit
from other effects that apply the

176
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
from other effects that apply the
 

177
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,030
from other effects that apply the
benefits of a rune. For example, a bomb

178
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
benefits of a rune. For example, a bomb
 

179
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,350
benefits of a rune. For example, a bomb
cannot benefit from the runic weapon

180
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
cannot benefit from the runic weapon
 

181
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,229
cannot benefit from the runic weapon
spell. Let's look at alchemist fire as

182
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
spell. Let's look at alchemist fire as
 

183
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,710
spell. Let's look at alchemist fire as
an example. This is a glass vial of

184
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
an example. This is a glass vial of
 

185
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,789
an example. This is a glass vial of
volatile liquids that you throw at a

186
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
volatile liquids that you throw at a
 

187
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,869
volatile liquids that you throw at a
target. The glass shatters on impact,

188
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
target. The glass shatters on impact,
 

189
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,869
target. The glass shatters on impact,
causing the liquid inside to burst into

190
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
causing the liquid inside to burst into
 

191
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,190
causing the liquid inside to burst into
fire. It has the alchemical trait,

192
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
fire. It has the alchemical trait,
 

193
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,509
fire. It has the alchemical trait,
meaning it's not magical. It has the

194
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
meaning it's not magical. It has the
 

195
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,509
meaning it's not magical. It has the
bomb trait, meaning it uses the

196
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
bomb trait, meaning it uses the
 

197
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,470
bomb trait, meaning it uses the
alchemical bomb stats found on page 281

198
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
alchemical bomb stats found on page 281
 

199
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,830
alchemical bomb stats found on page 281
of player core 1 as a foundation that's

200
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
of player core 1 as a foundation that's
 

201
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,470
of player core 1 as a foundation that's
further modified by the alchemist's fire

202
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
further modified by the alchemist's fire
 

203
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,110
further modified by the alchemist's fire
stat block. And most bombs that deal

204
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
stat block. And most bombs that deal
 

205
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,270
stat block. And most bombs that deal
damage have the splash trait. So, let's

206
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
damage have the splash trait. So, let's
 

207
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,990
damage have the splash trait. So, let's
take a moment to talk about that. If an

208
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
take a moment to talk about that. If an
 

209
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,550
take a moment to talk about that. If an
attack with a splash weapon succeeds or

210
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
attack with a splash weapon succeeds or
 

211
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,189
attack with a splash weapon succeeds or
critically succeeds, then all creatures

212
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
critically succeeds, then all creatures
 

213
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,749
critically succeeds, then all creatures
within 5 ft of the target, including

214
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
within 5 ft of the target, including
 

215
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,629
within 5 ft of the target, including
that target, take the listed splash

216
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
that target, take the listed splash
 

217
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,150
that target, take the listed splash
damage. And on a failure, the target of

218
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
damage. And on a failure, the target of
 

219
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,070
damage. And on a failure, the target of
the attack still suffers the splash

220
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
the attack still suffers the splash
 

221
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,950
the attack still suffers the splash
damage, but no one else does. Note that

222
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
damage, but no one else does. Note that
 

223
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,670
damage, but no one else does. Note that
splash damage is automatic. If the

224
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
splash damage is automatic. If the
 

225
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,230
splash damage is automatic. If the
attack roll is a hit, then everyone

226
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
attack roll is a hit, then everyone
 

227
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,110
attack roll is a hit, then everyone
within 5 ft of the target suffers the

228
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
within 5 ft of the target suffers the
 

229
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,590
within 5 ft of the target suffers the
damage. No extra attack rolls are

230
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
damage. No extra attack rolls are
 

231
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,070
damage. No extra attack rolls are
needed, nor does anyone get to make a

232
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
needed, nor does anyone get to make a
 

233
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,790
needed, nor does anyone get to make a
reflex save to lessen or avoid the

234
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
reflex save to lessen or avoid the
 

235
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,670
reflex save to lessen or avoid the
splash damage. And also be aware that

236
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
splash damage. And also be aware that
 

237
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,870
splash damage. And also be aware that
splash damage is never doubled due to a

238
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
splash damage is never doubled due to a
 

239
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,430
splash damage is never doubled due to a
critical success. So in the case of

240
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
critical success. So in the case of
 

241
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,670
critical success. So in the case of
alchemist fire, if you throw this at a

242
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
alchemist fire, if you throw this at a
 

243
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,510
alchemist fire, if you throw this at a
target and score a hit, the target

244
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
target and score a hit, the target
 

245
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,230
target and score a hit, the target
suffers 1d8 fire damage plus one

246
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
suffers 1d8 fire damage plus one
 

247
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,110
suffers 1d8 fire damage plus one
persistent fire damage and one fire

248
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
persistent fire damage and one fire
 

249
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,430
persistent fire damage and one fire
splash damage. Also, all creatures

250
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
splash damage. Also, all creatures
 

251
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,110
splash damage. Also, all creatures
standing in adjacent squares to the

252
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
standing in adjacent squares to the
 

253
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,150
standing in adjacent squares to the
target suffer one fire splash damage.

254
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
target suffer one fire splash damage.
 

255
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,230
target suffer one fire splash damage.
There is no saving throw to avoid this.

256
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
There is no saving throw to avoid this.
 

257
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,029
There is no saving throw to avoid this.
They just take the damage. On a critical

258
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
They just take the damage. On a critical
 

259
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,390
They just take the damage. On a critical
hit, the target suffers 2d8 fire damage

260
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
hit, the target suffers 2d8 fire damage
 

261
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,350
hit, the target suffers 2d8 fire damage
plus two persistent fire damage and one

262
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
plus two persistent fire damage and one
 

263
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,909
plus two persistent fire damage and one
fire splash damage because again, splash

264
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
fire splash damage because again, splash
 

265
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,670
fire splash damage because again, splash
damage is not multiplied due to a

266
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
damage is not multiplied due to a
 

267
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,230
damage is not multiplied due to a
critical success. And also, all

268
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
critical success. And also, all
 

269
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,909
critical success. And also, all
creatures adjacent to the target are

270
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
creatures adjacent to the target are
 

271
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,909
creatures adjacent to the target are
going to suffer one fire splash damage

272
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
going to suffer one fire splash damage
 

273
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,390
going to suffer one fire splash damage
as well. Note that splash damage is

274
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
as well. Note that splash damage is
 

275
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,550
as well. Note that splash damage is
added to the base damage when resolving

276
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
added to the base damage when resolving
 

277
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,189
added to the base damage when resolving
resistances and weaknesses. Meaning, if

278
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
resistances and weaknesses. Meaning, if
 

279
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,590
resistances and weaknesses. Meaning, if
the target of an alchemist fire attack

280
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
the target of an alchemist fire attack
 

281
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,469
the target of an alchemist fire attack
is weak to fire damage, that weakness

282
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
is weak to fire damage, that weakness
 

283
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,830
is weak to fire damage, that weakness
will only be triggered once, not once

284
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
will only be triggered once, not once
 

285
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,310
will only be triggered once, not once
for the base fire damage and then again

286
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
for the base fire damage and then again
 

287
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,110
for the base fire damage and then again
for the splash fire damage. If the

288
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
for the splash fire damage. If the
 

289
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,430
for the splash fire damage. If the
result of the attack roll is a failure,

290
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
result of the attack roll is a failure,
 

291
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,310
result of the attack roll is a failure,
then only the target suffers one fire

292
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,320
then only the target suffers one fire
 

293
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,870
then only the target suffers one fire
splash damage. And on a critical

294
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
splash damage. And on a critical
 

295
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,110
splash damage. And on a critical
failure, nothing happens. I usually

296
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
failure, nothing happens. I usually
 

297
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,510
failure, nothing happens. I usually
treat this as the bomb is just a dud and

298
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
treat this as the bomb is just a dud and
 

299
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,430
treat this as the bomb is just a dud and
doesn't go off. But in the right

300
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
doesn't go off. But in the right
 

301
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,510
doesn't go off. But in the right
situations, I might rule that it says

302
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
situations, I might rule that it says
 

303
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,189
situations, I might rule that it says
fire to something behind the target

304
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
fire to something behind the target
 

305
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,990
fire to something behind the target
instead. Using a bomb has the same

306
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
instead. Using a bomb has the same
 

307
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,309
instead. Using a bomb has the same
action requirements as anything else. So

308
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
action requirements as anything else. So
 

309
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,309
action requirements as anything else. So
it's one action to draw and one action

310
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
it's one action to draw and one action
 

311
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,629
it's one action to draw and one action
to throw. Not really any different than

312
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
to throw. Not really any different than
 

313
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,870
to throw. Not really any different than
drawing and throwing a dagger. Although

314
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
drawing and throwing a dagger. Although
 

315
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,710
drawing and throwing a dagger. Although
the quick bomber feet available to

316
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
the quick bomber feet available to
 

317
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,870
the quick bomber feet available to
Alchemists does reduce this to only one

318
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
Alchemists does reduce this to only one
 

319
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,469
Alchemists does reduce this to only one
action.

320
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
action.
 

321
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,550
action.
The second type of alchemical item is

322
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
The second type of alchemical item is
 

323
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,590
The second type of alchemical item is
alchemical poison. Poisons are basically

324
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
alchemical poison. Poisons are basically
 

325
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,510
alchemical poison. Poisons are basically
portable afflictions. So rather than

326
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
portable afflictions. So rather than
 

327
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,670
portable afflictions. So rather than
covering all of these rules here, I

328
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
covering all of these rules here, I
 

329
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,749
covering all of these rules here, I
instead recommend you view my video all

330
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
instead recommend you view my video all
 

331
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,990
instead recommend you view my video all
about afflictions, which I will include

332
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
about afflictions, which I will include
 

333
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,550
about afflictions, which I will include
a link to in the description. For this

334
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
a link to in the description. For this
 

335
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,390
a link to in the description. For this
discussion though, it is worth covering

336
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
discussion though, it is worth covering
 

337
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,150
discussion though, it is worth covering
the methods of exposure that are

338
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
the methods of exposure that are
 

339
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,870
the methods of exposure that are
available to alchemical poisons. Each

340
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
available to alchemical poisons. Each
 

341
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,029
available to alchemical poisons. Each
poison will have at least one of the

342
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
poison will have at least one of the
 

343
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,909
poison will have at least one of the
following traits: contact, ingested,

344
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
following traits: contact, ingested,
 

345
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,790
following traits: contact, ingested,
inhaled, or injury. Contact poisons

346
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
inhaled, or injury. Contact poisons
 

347
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,629
inhaled, or injury. Contact poisons
require direct contact with a creature's

348
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
require direct contact with a creature's
 

349
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,629
require direct contact with a creature's
skin in order to take effect. These

350
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
skin in order to take effect. These
 

351
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,469
skin in order to take effect. These
poisons are typically not used during

352
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
poisons are typically not used during
 

353
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,469
poisons are typically not used during
combat encounters as they cannot be

354
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
combat encounters as they cannot be
 

355
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,710
combat encounters as they cannot be
applied to weapons for delivery and

356
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
applied to weapons for delivery and
 

357
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,350
applied to weapons for delivery and
often have onset periods of at least 1

358
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
often have onset periods of at least 1
 

359
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,350
often have onset periods of at least 1
minute. Also, when it comes to

360
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
minute. Also, when it comes to
 

361
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,070
minute. Also, when it comes to
alchemical contact poisons, they only

362
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
alchemical contact poisons, they only
 

363
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,790
alchemical contact poisons, they only
affect the first creature to touch them.

364
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
affect the first creature to touch them.
 

365
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,029
affect the first creature to touch them.
So if you apply a dose in such a way

366
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
So if you apply a dose in such a way
 

367
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,110
So if you apply a dose in such a way
that more than one creature might make

368
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
that more than one creature might make
 

369
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,270
that more than one creature might make
contact with it, the poison is only

370
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
contact with it, the poison is only
 

371
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,390
contact with it, the poison is only
effective against the first. Ingested

372
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
effective against the first. Ingested
 

373
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,390
effective against the first. Ingested
poisons must be eaten to affect their

374
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
poisons must be eaten to affect their
 

375
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,629
poisons must be eaten to affect their
target. Typically, this means the poison

376
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
target. Typically, this means the poison
 

377
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,550
target. Typically, this means the poison
is placed in food or drink and may

378
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
is placed in food or drink and may
 

379
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,870
is placed in food or drink and may
require additional deception and stealth

380
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
require additional deception and stealth
 

381
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,830
require additional deception and stealth
checks to be successful. Next, we have

382
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
checks to be successful. Next, we have
 

383
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,550
checks to be successful. Next, we have
inhaled poisons. When these are applied,

384
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
inhaled poisons. When these are applied,
 

385
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,270
inhaled poisons. When these are applied,
they create a 10-ft cube lasting for 1

386
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
they create a 10-ft cube lasting for 1
 

387
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,589
they create a 10-ft cube lasting for 1
minute and affecting every creature that

388
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
minute and affecting every creature that
 

389
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,029
minute and affecting every creature that
enters the area. Raw specifically says

390
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
enters the area. Raw specifically says
 

391
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,110

00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
entering the area, but I believe
 

393
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,189

creatures who start their turn within

394
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
creatures who start their turn within
 

395
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,749
creatures who start their turn within
the space would be affected, too. If a

396
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
the space would be affected, too. If a
 

397
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,670
the space would be affected, too. If a
creature is aware of the poison gas,

poisons. These are applied to weapons or

412
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
poisons. These are applied to weapons or
 

413
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,550
poisons. These are applied to weapons or
ammunition that deal piercing or

414
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
ammunition that deal piercing or
 

415
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,110
ammunition that deal piercing or
slashing damage and then function on the

416
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
slashing damage and then function on the
 

417
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,830
slashing damage and then function on the
first strike made with said weapon. If

418
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
first strike made with said weapon. If
 

419
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,990
first strike made with said weapon. If
that attack hits, then the target will

420
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
that attack hits, then the target will
 

421
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,389
that attack hits, then the target will
need to make a saving throw. If it hit

422
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
need to make a saving throw. If it hit
 

423
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,870
need to make a saving throw. If it hit
but did not deal any damage, for

424
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
but did not deal any damage, for
 

425
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,269
but did not deal any damage, for
example, due to resistances, then the

426
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
example, due to resistances, then the
 

427
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,709
example, due to resistances, then the
poison does not take effect except in

428
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
poison does not take effect except in
 

429
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,190
poison does not take effect except in
the case of ammunition like arrows. If

430
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
the case of ammunition like arrows. If
 

431
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,190
the case of ammunition like arrows. If
the attack misses, then the poison

432
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
the attack misses, then the poison
 

433
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,509
the attack misses, then the poison
remains active on the weapon and you can

434
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
remains active on the weapon and you can
 

435
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,150
remains active on the weapon and you can
try again. And on a critical failure,

436
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
try again. And on a critical failure,
 

437
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,070
try again. And on a critical failure,
the poison does not affect the target

438
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
the poison does not affect the target
 

439
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,550
the poison does not affect the target
and is lost. So basically, once you

440
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
and is lost. So basically, once you
 

441
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,550
and is lost. So basically, once you
apply an injury poison to a piercing or

442
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
apply an injury poison to a piercing or
 

443
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,470
apply an injury poison to a piercing or
slashing weapon, the poison remains

444
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
slashing weapon, the poison remains
 

445
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,550
slashing weapon, the poison remains
active on it until you roll anything

446
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
active on it until you roll anything
 

447
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,509
active on it until you roll anything
other than a failure on an attack. Each

448
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
other than a failure on an attack. Each
 

449
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,509
other than a failure on an attack. Each
poison description will also detail how

450
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
poison description will also detail how
 

451
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,430
poison description will also detail how
many free hands and actions are required

452
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
many free hands and actions are required
 

453
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,509
many free hands and actions are required
to use the poison. For example,

454
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
to use the poison. For example,
 

455
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,910
to use the poison. For example,
Belladonna is an ingested poison that

456
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
Belladonna is an ingested poison that
 

457
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,230
Belladonna is an ingested poison that
requires one hand and one action to

458
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
requires one hand and one action to
 

459
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,870
requires one hand and one action to
place in someone's food or drink. But

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
place in someone's food or drink. But
 

461
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,509
place in someone's food or drink. But
black adder venom is an injury poison

463
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,910
black adder venom is an injury poison
that requires two actions and two hands

464
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
that requires two actions and two hands
 

465

487
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,190
they're not actually magical. They're
one use consumable items that you drink

488
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
one use consumable items that you drink
 

489
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,269
one use consumable items that you drink
and they apply their effect. That's

490
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
and they apply their effect. That's
 

491
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,350
and they apply their effect. That's
pretty straightforward, but there is one

492
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
pretty straightforward, but there is one
 

493
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,910
pretty straightforward, but there is one
special type of elixir worth discussing.

494
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
special type of elixir worth discussing.
 

495
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,470
special type of elixir worth discussing.
Mutagens. If regular alchemy is

00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
Mutagens. If regular alchemy is
 

497
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,910
Mutagens. If regular alchemy is
considered to be the science of

Pathfinder, then mutagens are the realm
 

501
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,389
Pathfinder, then mutagens are the realm
of mad scientists like Dr. Jackekal and

of mad scientists like Dr. Jackekal and
Mr. Hyde. Mutagens are alchemical

Mr. Hyde. Mutagens are alchemical
 

505
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,110
Mr. Hyde. Mutagens are alchemical
elixirs, so they are consumable items

506
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
elixirs, so they are consumable items
 

507
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,870
elixirs, so they are consumable items
you have to drink in order to gain their

you have to drink in order to gain their
 

509
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,350
you have to drink in order to gain their
effects. But they differ from regular

510
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
effects. But they differ from regular
 

511
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,230
effects. But they differ from regular
elixirs in that they always have both a

512
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
elixirs in that they always have both a
 

513
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,790
elixirs in that they always have both a
beneficial effect and a drawback. For

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
beneficial effect and a drawback. For
 

515
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,110
beneficial effect and a drawback. For
example, the juggernaut mutagen grants a

516
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
example, the juggernaut mutagen grants a
 

517
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,870
example, the juggernaut mutagen grants a
bonus to fortitude saves and temporary

518
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
bonus to fortitude saves and temporary
 

519
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,990

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,949
to will saves, perception checks, and

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
initiative roles. And all mutagens are
 

525
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,269

polymorph state that no creature may be
 

529

polymorph effect at the same time. If
they're subject to a polymorph effect

they're subject to a polymorph effect
 

535
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,230
they're subject to a polymorph effect
and then targeted by a new polymorph

536
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
and then targeted by a new polymorph
 

537
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,389
and then targeted by a new polymorph
effect, the new polymorph effect

538
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
effect, the new polymorph effect
 

539
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,190
effect, the new polymorph effect
attempts to counteract the first. If it

540
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
attempts to counteract the first. If it
 

541
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,190
attempts to counteract the first. If it
succeeds, then the first polymorph

542
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
succeeds, then the first polymorph
 

543
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,069
succeeds, then the first polymorph
effect ends and the new one begins. What

544
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
effect ends and the new one begins. What
 

545
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,550
effect ends and the new one begins. What
this basically means is you can't drink

546
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
this basically means is you can't drink
 

547
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,710
this basically means is you can't drink
two mutagens and gain the effects of

548
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
two mutagens and gain the effects of
 

549
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,509
two mutagens and gain the effects of
both. And furthermore, you can't choose

550
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
both. And furthermore, you can't choose
 

551
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,829
both. And furthermore, you can't choose
to end the effects of the first one in

552
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
to end the effects of the first one in
 

553
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,710
to end the effects of the first one in
favor of the second one. Instead, the

554
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
favor of the second one. Instead, the
 

555
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,190
favor of the second one. Instead, the
second would need to make a counteract

556
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
second would need to make a counteract
 

557
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,190
second would need to make a counteract
check against the first one.

558
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
check against the first one.
 

559
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,790
check against the first one.
Essentially, the two mutagens are

560
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
Essentially, the two mutagens are
 

561
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,470
Essentially, the two mutagens are
fighting it out in your system to see

562
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
fighting it out in your system to see
 

563
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,230
fighting it out in your system to see
which one is going to win and be

564
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
which one is going to win and be
 

565
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,630
which one is going to win and be
effective. When making these counteract

566
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
effective. When making these counteract
 

567
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,949
effective. When making these counteract
checks, each mutagen has a counteract

568
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
checks, each mutagen has a counteract
 

569
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,870
checks, each mutagen has a counteract
level equal to half their item level

570
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
level equal to half their item level
 

571
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,150
level equal to half their item level
rounded up, a counteract DC equal to a

572
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
rounded up, a counteract DC equal to a
 

573
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,470
rounded up, a counteract DC equal to a
standard DC for its item level, and a

574
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
standard DC for its item level, and a

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,790
standard DC for its item level, and a
counteract modifier equal to a standard

counteract modifier equal to a standard
 

577
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,150
counteract modifier equal to a standard
DC for its item level minus 10. Now,

578
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
DC for its item level minus 10. Now,
 

579
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,230
DC for its item level minus 10. Now,
this may sound complicated, and

580
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
this may sound complicated, and
 

581
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,990
this may sound complicated, and
honestly, it is, but this situation only

582
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
honestly, it is, but this situation only
 

583
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,389
honestly, it is, but this situation only
occurs when you try drinking a second

584
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
occurs when you try drinking a second
 

585
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,430
occurs when you try drinking a second
mutagen before the first one wears off.

586
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
mutagen before the first one wears off.
 

587
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,430
mutagen before the first one wears off.
As long as you don't do that, then you

588
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
As long as you don't do that, then you
 

589
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,670
As long as you don't do that, then you
don't need to worry about counteracting

590
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
don't need to worry about counteracting
 

591

these mutagens are not magical, any

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
these mutagens are not magical, any
 

609
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,230
these mutagens are not magical, any
attacks gained through drinking them are

attacks gained through drinking them are
 

611
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,509
attacks gained through drinking them are
considered to be magical. For example,

612
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
considered to be magical. For example,
 

613
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,150
considered to be magical. For example,
the claws gained from a bestial mutagen

614
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
the claws gained from a bestial mutagen
 

615
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,230
the claws gained from a bestial mutagen
are treated as being magical when

616
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
are treated as being magical when
 

617
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,550
are treated as being magical when
attacking enemies that are resistant to

618
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
attacking enemies that are resistant to
 

619
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,110
attacking enemies that are resistant to
non-magical attacks. But since they are

620
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
non-magical attacks. But since they are
 

621
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,030
non-magical attacks. But since they are
not really magical, they still don't

622
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
not really magical, they still don't
 

623
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,710
not really magical, they still don't
register to spells like detect magic.

624
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
register to spells like detect magic.
 

625

So, there you have it, a quick look at
 

627
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,110
So, there you have it, a quick look at
alchemy and alchemical items. If you

628
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
alchemy and alchemical items. If you
