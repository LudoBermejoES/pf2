A common example is being struck by a

The key piece of this that applies to

100
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
The key piece of this that applies to
 

101
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,789
The key piece of this that applies to
spellcasting is using a manipulate

102
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
spellcasting is using a manipulate
 

103
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,590
spellcasting is using a manipulate
action. The manipulate trait says you

104
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
action. The manipulate trait says you
 

105
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,670
action. The manipulate trait says you
must physically manipulate an item or

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
must physically manipulate an item or
 

107
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,990
must physically manipulate an item or
make gestures to use an action with this

108
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
make gestures to use an action with this
 

109
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,150
make gestures to use an action with this
trait. Creatures without a suitable

110
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
trait. Creatures without a suitable
 

111
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,390
trait. Creatures without a suitable
appendage cannot perform actions with

112
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
appendage cannot perform actions with
 

113
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,790
appendage cannot perform actions with
this trait. Manipulate actions often

114
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
this trait. Manipulate actions often
 

115
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,270
this trait. Manipulate actions often
trigger reactions. And you'll notice

116
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
trigger reactions. And you'll notice
 

117
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,589
trigger reactions. And you'll notice
that if a spell requires actions to be

118
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
that if a spell requires actions to be
 

119
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,390
that if a spell requires actions to be
spent casting it, then it almost always

120
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
spent casting it, then it almost always
 

121
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,030
spent casting it, then it almost always
has the manipulate trait. And if the

122
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
has the manipulate trait. And if the
 

123
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,350
has the manipulate trait. And if the
spell is cast using a reaction, then it

124
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
spell is cast using a reaction, then it
 

125
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,110
spell is cast using a reaction, then it
almost always does not have the

126
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
almost always does not have the
 

127
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,589
almost always does not have the
manipulate trait. So most of the time

128
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
manipulate trait. So most of the time
 

129
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,309
manipulate trait. So most of the time
when you cast a spell in combat, it will

130
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
when you cast a spell in combat, it will
 

131
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,710
when you cast a spell in combat, it will
have the manipulate trait and therefore

132
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
have the manipulate trait and therefore
 

133
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,110
have the manipulate trait and therefore
may trigger reactions from enemies like

134
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
may trigger reactions from enemies like
 

135
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,589
may trigger reactions from enemies like
reactive strike. And if that reactive

136
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
reactive strike. And if that reactive
 

137
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,750
reactive strike. And if that reactive
strike is a critical hit, then the spell

138
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
strike is a critical hit, then the spell
 

139
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,150
strike is a critical hit, then the spell
you're casting is disrupted. When a

140
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
you're casting is disrupted. When a
 

141
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,470
you're casting is disrupted. When a
spell is disrupted, it is lost along

142
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
spell is disrupted, it is lost along
 

143
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,470
spell is disrupted, it is lost along
with all resources that were committed

144
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
with all resources that were committed
 

145
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,949
with all resources that were committed
to the casting of that spell. Meaning

146
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
to the casting of that spell. Meaning
 

147
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,670
to the casting of that spell. Meaning
you lose all of the required actions. If

148
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
you lose all of the required actions. If
 

149
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,910
you lose all of the required actions. If
it was a spell that cost three actions

150
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
it was a spell that cost three actions
 

151
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,070
it was a spell that cost three actions
and it's immediately disrupted by an

152
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
and it's immediately disrupted by an
 

153
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,470
and it's immediately disrupted by an
enemy's reactive strike, then you lose

154
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
enemy's reactive strike, then you lose
 

155
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,350
enemy's reactive strike, then you lose
all three actions. The reactive strike

156
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
all three actions. The reactive strike
 

157
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,350
all three actions. The reactive strike
doesn't occur after your first of those

158
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
doesn't occur after your first of those
 

159
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,869
doesn't occur after your first of those
actions, leaving you two that you can

160
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
actions, leaving you two that you can
 

161
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,350
actions, leaving you two that you can
spend on other activities. All three

162
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
spend on other activities. All three
 

163
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,229
spend on other activities. All three
actions would be lost, and all other

164
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
actions would be lost, and all other
 

165
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,550
actions would be lost, and all other
resources are also lost. You lose the

166
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
resources are also lost. You lose the
 

167
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,309
resources are also lost. You lose the
spell slot that was committed, as well

168
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
spell slot that was committed, as well
 

169
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,270
spell slot that was committed, as well
as any material cost for the spell. And

170
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
as any material cost for the spell. And
 

171
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,670
as any material cost for the spell. And
when an attempt to sustain a spell is

172
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
when an attempt to sustain a spell is
 

173
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,550
when an attempt to sustain a spell is
disrupted, not only is that action lost,

174
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
disrupted, not only is that action lost,
 

175
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,149
disrupted, not only is that action lost,
but the spell you are attempting to

176
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
but the spell you are attempting to
 

177
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,070
but the spell you are attempting to
sustain immediately ends.

178
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
sustain immediately ends.
 

179
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,550
sustain immediately ends.
Let's review the rules for targeting.

180
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
Let's review the rules for targeting.
 

181
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,470
Let's review the rules for targeting.
This applies to all attacks, but can

182
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
This applies to all attacks, but can
 

183
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,470
This applies to all attacks, but can
become especially confusing when casting

184
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
become especially confusing when casting
 

185
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,390
become especially confusing when casting
spells due to how people imagine them

186
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
spells due to how people imagine them
 

187
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,149
spells due to how people imagine them
manifesting within the narrative of the

188
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
manifesting within the narrative of the
 

189
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,470
manifesting within the narrative of the
game. where sometimes there's a massive

190
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
game. where sometimes there's a massive
 

191
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,869
game. where sometimes there's a massive
fireball that physically travels to the

192
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
fireball that physically travels to the
 

193
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,270
fireball that physically travels to the
target and other times a spell manifests

194
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
target and other times a spell manifests
 

195
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,509
target and other times a spell manifests
like a Jedi mind trick that confuses the

196
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
like a Jedi mind trick that confuses the
 

197
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,830
like a Jedi mind trick that confuses the
target without anything physical passing

198
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
target without anything physical passing
 

199
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,869
target without anything physical passing
between the caster and their target. By

200
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
between the caster and their target. By
 

201
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,190
between the caster and their target. By
raw, the rules work the same way in both

202
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
raw, the rules work the same way in both
 

203
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,830
raw, the rules work the same way in both
cases without any special consideration

204
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
cases without any special consideration
 

205
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,149
cases without any special consideration
given to spells that have no physical

206
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
given to spells that have no physical
 

207
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,390
given to spells that have no physical
manifestation. When you cast the spell,

208
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
manifestation. When you cast the spell,
 

209
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,030
manifestation. When you cast the spell,
you must have line of effect to the

210
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
you must have line of effect to the
 

211
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,270
you must have line of effect to the
target. And in order to have line of

212
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
target. And in order to have line of
 

213
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,070
target. And in order to have line of
effect, there must be an unobstructed

214
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
effect, there must be an unobstructed
 

215
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,949
effect, there must be an unobstructed
path to the target. And generally, as

216
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
path to the target. And generally, as
 

217
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,430
path to the target. And generally, as
long as the target is not behind a solid

218
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
long as the target is not behind a solid
 

219
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,069
long as the target is not behind a solid
wall that blocks all physical access to

220
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
wall that blocks all physical access to
 

221
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,110
wall that blocks all physical access to
them, then you have line of effect. If

222
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
them, then you have line of effect. If
 

223
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,110
them, then you have line of effect. If
the target is only partially behind a

224
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
the target is only partially behind a
 

225
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,350
the target is only partially behind a
solid object, like behind a crate or a

226
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
solid object, like behind a crate or a
 

227
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,990
solid object, like behind a crate or a
port cullis, then there is still line of

228
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
port cullis, then there is still line of
 

229
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,950
port cullis, then there is still line of
effect and you can target them, but they

230
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
effect and you can target them, but they
 

231
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,670
effect and you can target them, but they
also have cover if you cast an area

232
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
also have cover if you cast an area
 

233
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,909
also have cover if you cast an area
effect with a point of origin on your

234
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
effect with a point of origin on your
 

235
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,469
effect with a point of origin on your
side of the gate. And the rule of thumb

236
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
side of the gate. And the rule of thumb
 

237
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,430
side of the gate. And the rule of thumb
provided by player core 1 is that a 1 ft

238
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
provided by player core 1 is that a 1 ft
 

239
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,990
provided by player core 1 is that a 1 ft
square gap in a barrier is all that is

240
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
square gap in a barrier is all that is
 

241
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,710
square gap in a barrier is all that is
needed to allow line of effect. But as

242
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
needed to allow line of effect. But as
 

243
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,510
needed to allow line of effect. But as
always, the GM has the final say. Also

244
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
always, the GM has the final say. Also
 

245
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,110
always, the GM has the final say. Also
be aware that when casting a spell with

246
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
be aware that when casting a spell with
 

247
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,830
be aware that when casting a spell with
an area effect, the caster needs a line

248
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
an area effect, the caster needs a line
 

249
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,749
an area effect, the caster needs a line
of effect to where they are placing the

250
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
of effect to where they are placing the
 

251
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,310
of effect to where they are placing the
origin of the effect and all affected

252
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
origin of the effect and all affected
 

253
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,550
origin of the effect and all affected
creatures and objects needs line of

254
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
creatures and objects needs line of
 

255
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,670
creatures and objects needs line of
effect to that point. For example, if

256
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
effect to that point. For example, if
 

257
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,390
effect to that point. For example, if
you cast a fireball spell, you need line

258
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
you cast a fireball spell, you need line
 

259
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,710
you cast a fireball spell, you need line
of effect to the point of detonation for

260
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
of effect to the point of detonation for
 

261
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,029
of effect to the point of detonation for
the fireball. And in order for an enemy

262
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
the fireball. And in order for an enemy
 

263
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,670
the fireball. And in order for an enemy
to be hit by that fireball, there needs

264
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
to be hit by that fireball, there needs
 

265
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,909
to be hit by that fireball, there needs
to be line of effect from that point and

266
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
to be line of effect from that point and
 

267
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,710
to be line of effect from that point and
them. If the path to them is not

268
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
them. If the path to them is not
 

269
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,790
them. If the path to them is not
completely blocked, then there would be

270
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
completely blocked, then there would be
 

271
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,550
completely blocked, then there would be
line of effect and they would likely

272
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
line of effect and they would likely
 

273
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,749
line of effect and they would likely
receive cover. And note that the rule

274
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
receive cover. And note that the rule
 

275
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,550
receive cover. And note that the rule
for line of effect says visibility

276
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
for line of effect says visibility
 

277
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,510
for line of effect says visibility
doesn't matter for line of effect.

278
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
doesn't matter for line of effect.
 

279
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,270
doesn't matter for line of effect.
Meaning it doesn't matter if you can see

280
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
Meaning it doesn't matter if you can see
 

281
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,590
Meaning it doesn't matter if you can see
the target or not. If the target is

282
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
the target or not. If the target is
 

283
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,909
the target or not. If the target is
inside a building behind a closed

284
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
inside a building behind a closed
 

285
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,870
inside a building behind a closed
window, you may be able to see them, but

286
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
window, you may be able to see them, but
 

287
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,830
window, you may be able to see them, but
your line of effect stops at the closed

288
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
your line of effect stops at the closed
 

289
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,150
your line of effect stops at the closed
window. Therefore, you wouldn't be able

290
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
window. Therefore, you wouldn't be able
 

291
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,909
window. Therefore, you wouldn't be able
to target them with a spell- like

292
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
to target them with a spell- like
 

293
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,629
to target them with a spell- like
confusion, even though there is nothing

294
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
confusion, even though there is nothing
 

295
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,710
confusion, even though there is nothing
physically traveling between you and

296
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
physically traveling between you and
 

297
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,110
physically traveling between you and
them. Now, this often raises a lot of

298
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
them. Now, this often raises a lot of
 

299
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,029
them. Now, this often raises a lot of
questions about line of sight and how it

300
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
questions about line of sight and how it
 

301
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,270
questions about line of sight and how it
applies. I have another video that goes

302
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
applies. I have another video that goes
 

303
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,510
applies. I have another video that goes
over the four degrees of perception and

304
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
over the four degrees of perception and
 

305
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,990
over the four degrees of perception and
how they affect targeting creatures. So,

306
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
how they affect targeting creatures. So,
 

307
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,909
how they affect targeting creatures. So,
I'm not going to repeat all of that

308
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
I'm not going to repeat all of that
 

309
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,950
I'm not going to repeat all of that
content here, but I will briefly cover a

310
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
content here, but I will briefly cover a
 

311
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,550
content here, but I will briefly cover a
few examples. And if you need more

312
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
few examples. And if you need more
 

313
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,309
few examples. And if you need more
information about how this works, there

314
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
information about how this works, there
 

315
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,189
information about how this works, there
is a link to that video on perception in

316
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
is a link to that video on perception in
 

317
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,070
is a link to that video on perception in
this video's description. First, let's

318
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
this video's description. First, let's
 

319
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,790
this video's description. First, let's
talk about what I call general spells.

320
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
talk about what I call general spells.
 

321
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,710
talk about what I call general spells.
These are the ones that simply say

322
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
These are the ones that simply say
 

323
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,670
These are the ones that simply say
things like targets one creature. For

324
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
things like targets one creature. For
 

325
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,390
things like targets one creature. For
example, divine lance. For this spell,

326
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
example, divine lance. For this spell,
 

327
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,550
example, divine lance. For this spell,
you need a line of effect to the target,

328
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
you need a line of effect to the target,
 

329
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,270
you need a line of effect to the target,
but don't necessarily need to be able to

330
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
but don't necessarily need to be able to
 

331
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,909
but don't necessarily need to be able to
see them. If they have the concealed or

332
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
see them. If they have the concealed or
 

333
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,070
see them. If they have the concealed or
hidden conditions, you can still try to

334
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
hidden conditions, you can still try to
 

335
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,150
hidden conditions, you can still try to
attack them with divine lance, but will

336
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
attack them with divine lance, but will
 

337
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,150
attack them with divine lance, but will
need to pass a flat check or you

338
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
need to pass a flat check or you
 

339
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,550
need to pass a flat check or you
automatically miss. Next, there are

340
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
automatically miss. Next, there are
 

341
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,029
automatically miss. Next, there are
spells that specify you must be able to

342
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
spells that specify you must be able to
 

343
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,830
spells that specify you must be able to
see the target. For example, vengeful

344
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
see the target. For example, vengeful
 

345
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,790
see the target. For example, vengeful
glare states in its targets entry, one

346
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
glare states in its targets entry, one
 

347
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,670
glare states in its targets entry, one
creature you can see. Therefore, you

348
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
creature you can see. Therefore, you
 

349
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,749
creature you can see. Therefore, you
could target a creature with a concealed

350
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
could target a creature with a concealed
 

351
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,589
could target a creature with a concealed
condition, but would need to pass the

352
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
condition, but would need to pass the
 

353
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,230
condition, but would need to pass the
DC5 flat check because that target is

354
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
DC5 flat check because that target is
 

355
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,830
DC5 flat check because that target is
concealed. But you would not be able to

356
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
concealed. But you would not be able to
 

357
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,510
concealed. But you would not be able to
target a creature with the hidden

358
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
target a creature with the hidden
 

359
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,510
target a creature with the hidden
condition because hidden specifically

360
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
condition because hidden specifically
 

361
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,790
condition because hidden specifically
states you cannot see them. Then we have

362
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
states you cannot see them. Then we have
 

363
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,350
states you cannot see them. Then we have
area effects. What happens if you cast a

364
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
area effects. What happens if you cast a
 

365
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,430
area effects. What happens if you cast a
fireball as someone who is standing

366
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
fireball as someone who is standing
 

367
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,870
fireball as someone who is standing
behind a closed window? Again, your line

368
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
behind a closed window? Again, your line
 

369
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,270
behind a closed window? Again, your line
of effect would end at the closed

370
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
of effect would end at the closed
 

371
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,589
of effect would end at the closed
window. So you would need to place the

372
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
window. So you would need to place the
 

373
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,510
window. So you would need to place the
point of origin for the fireball's

374
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
point of origin for the fireball's
 

375
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,309
point of origin for the fireball's
detonation somewhere on your side of the

376
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
detonation somewhere on your side of the
 

377
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,670
detonation somewhere on your side of the
window. And by raw, there would be no

378
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
window. And by raw, there would be no
 

379
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,309
window. And by raw, there would be no
line of effect to the person behind the

380
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
line of effect to the person behind the
 

381
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,550
line of effect to the person behind the
closed window. Therefore, they would not

382
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
closed window. Therefore, they would not
 

383
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,710
closed window. Therefore, they would not
need to roll a reflex save or worry

384
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
need to roll a reflex save or worry
 

385
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,110
need to roll a reflex save or worry
about suffering any damage. And again,

386
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
about suffering any damage. And again,
 

387
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,670
about suffering any damage. And again,
that's the raw explanation. But that

388
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
that's the raw explanation. But that
 

389
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,150
that's the raw explanation. But that
said, GMs are encouraged to adjust the

390
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
said, GMs are encouraged to adjust the
 

391
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,629
said, GMs are encouraged to adjust the
rules however is best for their game. So

392
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
rules however is best for their game. So
 

393
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,550
rules however is best for their game. So
in this case, the GM might instead grant

394
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
in this case, the GM might instead grant
 

395
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,950
in this case, the GM might instead grant
the target cover and deduct the hit

396
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
the target cover and deduct the hit
 

397
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,029
the target cover and deduct the hit
point value of the window from the

398
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
point value of the window from the
 

399
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,270
point value of the window from the
damage applied by the fireball. And

400
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
damage applied by the fireball. And
 

401
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,670
damage applied by the fireball. And
last, some spells adjust or remove the

402
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
last, some spells adjust or remove the
 

403
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,589
last, some spells adjust or remove the
requirement for line of effect. For

404
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
requirement for line of effect. For
 

405
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,469
requirement for line of effect. For
example, familiar's face has a range of

406
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
example, familiar's face has a range of
 

407
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,110
example, familiar's face has a range of
one mile and targets one willing

408
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
one mile and targets one willing
 

409
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,670
one mile and targets one willing
creature that's your animal companion or

410
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
creature that's your animal companion or
 

411
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,070
creature that's your animal companion or
familiar. So, normally you would need

412
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
familiar. So, normally you would need
 

413
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,990
familiar. So, normally you would need
line of effect to your familiar to cast

414
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
line of effect to your familiar to cast
 

415
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,309
line of effect to your familiar to cast
this on them. But the spells text

416
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
this on them. But the spells text
 

417
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,550
this on them. But the spells text
includes a special notation that says

418
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
includes a special notation that says
 

419
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,189
includes a special notation that says
you don't need line of sight or a line

420
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
you don't need line of sight or a line
 

421
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,510
you don't need line of sight or a line
of effect to your target when you cast

422
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
of effect to your target when you cast
 

423
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,749
of effect to your target when you cast
this spell. So, in this case, you would

424
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
this spell. So, in this case, you would
 

425
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,909
this spell. So, in this case, you would
only need to be within one mile of your

426
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
only need to be within one mile of your
 

427
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,070
only need to be within one mile of your
animal companion or familiar to target

428
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
animal companion or familiar to target
 

429
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,870
animal companion or familiar to target
them with familiar's face.

430
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880

 

431
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,190

In the first example, team Pathfinder is

432
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
In the first example, team Pathfinder is
 

433
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,030
In the first example, team Pathfinder is
battling a tribe of goblins in a

434
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
battling a tribe of goblins in a
 

435
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,750
battling a tribe of goblins in a
corridor. For our purposes, the red bars

436
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
corridor. For our purposes, the red bars
 

437
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,750
corridor. For our purposes, the red bars
represent closed doors and the green

438
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
represent closed doors and the green
 

439
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,630
represent closed doors and the green
bars represent open doors. Her friends

440
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
bars represent open doors. Her friends
 

441
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,630
bars represent open doors. Her friends
are taking a beating. So on Kyra's turn,

442
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
are taking a beating. So on Kyra's turn,
 

443
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,870
are taking a beating. So on Kyra's turn,
she casts heal using three actions so

444
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
she casts heal using three actions so
 

445
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,790
she casts heal using three actions so
that it heals all living creatures

446
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
that it heals all living creatures
 

447
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,590
that it heals all living creatures
within 30 ft of her. This is a 30-foot

448
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
within 30 ft of her. This is a 30-foot
 

449
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,070
within 30 ft of her. This is a 30-foot
imination centered on her square and

450
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
imination centered on her square and
 

451
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,310
imination centered on her square and
again heals all willing creatures within

452
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
again heals all willing creatures within
 

453
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,269
again heals all willing creatures within
that range. So here we can see all of

454
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
that range. So here we can see all of
 

455
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,110
that range. So here we can see all of
the targets within the range of that

456
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
the targets within the range of that
 

457
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,509
the targets within the range of that
spell. But next we need to apply line of

458
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
spell. But next we need to apply line of
 

459
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,910
spell. But next we need to apply line of
effect. In order for there to be line of

460
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
effect. In order for there to be line of
 

461
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,910
effect. In order for there to be line of
effect, there must be an unobstructed

462
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
effect, there must be an unobstructed
 

463
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,310
effect, there must be an unobstructed
path from the point of origin, which in

464
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
path from the point of origin, which in
 

465
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,190
path from the point of origin, which in
this case is Kaira, to the target. When

466
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
this case is Kaira, to the target. When
 

467
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,269
this case is Kaira, to the target. When
debating if there is line of effect, I

468
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
debating if there is line of effect, I
 

469
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,750
debating if there is line of effect, I
like to apply the flashlight rule, which

470
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
like to apply the flashlight rule, which
 

471
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,230
like to apply the flashlight rule, which
says if Kyra could shine a flashlight on

472
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
says if Kyra could shine a flashlight on
 

473
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,310
says if Kyra could shine a flashlight on
a target from where she's standing, then

474
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
a target from where she's standing, then
 

475
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,949
a target from where she's standing, then
there is line of effect. So, let's apply

476
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
there is line of effect. So, let's apply
 

477
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,269
there is line of effect. So, let's apply
that rule. Starting with the easy ones,

478
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
that rule. Starting with the easy ones,
 

479
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,990
that rule. Starting with the easy ones,
Valeros and Mauricio. She easily could

480
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
Valeros and Mauricio. She easily could
 

481
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,310
Valeros and Mauricio. She easily could
shine the light on Valeros. And even

482
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
shine the light on Valeros. And even
 

483
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,150
shine the light on Valeros. And even
though there is a goblin between her and

484
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
though there is a goblin between her and
 

485
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,710
though there is a goblin between her and
Mara, the goblin doesn't completely

486
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
Mara, the goblin doesn't completely
 

487
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,949
Mara, the goblin doesn't completely
obscure her and Cairo would still be

488
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
obscure her and Cairo would still be
 

489
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,430
obscure her and Cairo would still be
able to hit her with a flashlight. So

490
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
able to hit her with a flashlight. So
 

491
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,230
able to hit her with a flashlight. So
there is line of effect to both of them.

492
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
there is line of effect to both of them.
 

493
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,949
there is line of effect to both of them.
Next, let's consider Ezin and Cion.

494
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
Next, let's consider Ezin and Cion.
 

495
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,790
Next, let's consider Ezin and Cion.
Those doors are open and even though it

496
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
Those doors are open and even though it
 

497
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,110
Those doors are open and even though it
might be difficult, I believe Kyra could

498
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
might be difficult, I believe Kyra could
 

499
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,110
might be difficult, I believe Kyra could
shine her flashlight on both of them as

500
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
shine her flashlight on both of them as
 

501
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,590
shine her flashlight on both of them as
well. So they do have line of effect,

502
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
well. So they do have line of effect,
 

503
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,790
well. So they do have line of effect,
too. Lim, on the other hand, is behind a

504
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
too. Lim, on the other hand, is behind a
 

505
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,269
too. Lim, on the other hand, is behind a
closed door. Kyra could not shine a

506
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
closed door. Kyra could not shine a
 

507
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,269
closed door. Kyra could not shine a
light on him. So there is no line of

508
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
light on him. So there is no line of
 

509
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,190
light on him. So there is no line of
effect. And it's worth mentioning that

510
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
effect. And it's worth mentioning that
 

511
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,030
effect. And it's worth mentioning that
it would not make any difference at all

512
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
it would not make any difference at all
 

513
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,030
it would not make any difference at all
if the door was made of glass and was

514
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
if the door was made of glass and was
 

515
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,350
if the door was made of glass and was
transparent. That would allow line of

516
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
transparent. That would allow line of
 

517
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,069
transparent. That would allow line of
sight, but not line of effect. It would

518
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
sight, but not line of effect. It would
 

519
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,990
sight, but not line of effect. It would
still be a physical barrier that

520
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
still be a physical barrier that
 

521
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,389
still be a physical barrier that
obstructs the path to the target. That

522
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
obstructs the path to the target. That
 

523
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,230
obstructs the path to the target. That
also means that the flashlight rule

524
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
also means that the flashlight rule
 

525
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,430
also means that the flashlight rule
isn't a 100% perfect illustration, but

526
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
isn't a 100% perfect illustration, but
 

527
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,230
isn't a 100% perfect illustration, but
it works for me in most situations.

528
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
it works for me in most situations.
 

529
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,190
it works for me in most situations.
Now comes the hard one. Sila, is there

530
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
Now comes the hard one. Sila, is there
 

531
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,710
Now comes the hard one. Sila, is there
line of effect from Kyra to her? By raw,

532
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
line of effect from Kyra to her? By raw,
 

533
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,430
line of effect from Kyra to her? By raw,
no, there is not. Kyra would not be able

534
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
no, there is not. Kyra would not be able
 

535
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,509
no, there is not. Kyra would not be able
to shine a flashlight on her from her

536
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
to shine a flashlight on her from her
 

537
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,750
to shine a flashlight on her from her
current space as Sila is completely

538
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
current space as Sila is completely
 

539
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,630
current space as Sila is completely
obscured behind a wall, but the door is

540
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
obscured behind a wall, but the door is
 

541
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,030
obscured behind a wall, but the door is
open and she's next to the door. And

542
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
open and she's next to the door. And
 

543
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,870
open and she's next to the door. And
this is where a lot of GMs will put

544
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
this is where a lot of GMs will put
 

545
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,350
this is where a lot of GMs will put
their own spin on things. Some would say

546
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
their own spin on things. Some would say
 

547
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,110
their own spin on things. Some would say
that the radiant light from the heel

548
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
that the radiant light from the heel
 

549
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,350
that the radiant light from the heel
spell spills through the doorway and

550
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
spell spills through the doorway and
 

551
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,630
spell spills through the doorway and
around the corner and does affect Sila.

552
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
around the corner and does affect Sila.
 

553
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,710
around the corner and does affect Sila.
That's not supported by the rules as

554
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
That's not supported by the rules as
 

555
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,509
That's not supported by the rules as
written, but as a GM, that's absolutely

556
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
written, but as a GM, that's absolutely
 

557
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,230
written, but as a GM, that's absolutely
in their right to decide differently.

558
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
in their right to decide differently.
 

559
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,030
in their right to decide differently.
And what about the goblins? There is

560
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
And what about the goblins? There is
 

561
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,110
And what about the goblins? There is
clear line of effect to several of them,

562
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
clear line of effect to several of them,
 

563
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,910
clear line of effect to several of them,
but will they be healed, too? And the

564
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
but will they be healed, too? And the
 

565
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,990
but will they be healed, too? And the
answer is yes, they would. They are

566
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
answer is yes, they would. They are
 

567
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,829
answer is yes, they would. They are
living creatures, and one would likely

568
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
living creatures, and one would likely
 

569
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,150
living creatures, and one would likely
assume they are willing to be healed, so

570
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
assume they are willing to be healed, so
 

571
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,470
assume they are willing to be healed, so
they would be healed. However, clerics

572
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
they would be healed. However, clerics
 

573
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,949
they would be healed. However, clerics
can take the selective energy feat to

574
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
can take the selective energy feat to
 

575
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,030
can take the selective energy feat to
avoid healing their enemies.

576
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
avoid healing their enemies.
 

577
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,310
avoid healing their enemies.
In our next example, Kyra casts Noise

578
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
In our next example, Kyra casts Noise
 

579
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,509
In our next example, Kyra casts Noise
Blast to attack the goblins. Noise Blast

580
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
Blast to attack the goblins. Noise Blast
 

581
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,550
Blast to attack the goblins. Noise Blast
is a 10- ft burst area attack with a 30

582
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
is a 10- ft burst area attack with a 30
 

583
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,110
is a 10- ft burst area attack with a 30
ft range. Instead of the spell effect

584
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
ft range. Instead of the spell effect
 

585
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,590
ft range. Instead of the spell effect
emanating away from her, she instead

586
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
emanating away from her, she instead
 

587
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,670
emanating away from her, she instead
needs to target an intersection of

588
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
needs to target an intersection of
 

589
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,870
needs to target an intersection of
squares that is within 30 ft of her, and

590
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
squares that is within 30 ft of her, and
 

591
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,269
squares that is within 30 ft of her, and
all squares within 10 ft of that point

592
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
all squares within 10 ft of that point
 

593
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,230
all squares within 10 ft of that point
of origin will be within the area of

594
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
of origin will be within the area of
 

595
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,550
of origin will be within the area of
effect. For example, if she wishes to

596
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
effect. For example, if she wishes to
 

597
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,629
effect. For example, if she wishes to
attack the goblins to the left of her,

598
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
attack the goblins to the left of her,
 

599
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,509
attack the goblins to the left of her,
she might target this intersection,

600
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
she might target this intersection,
 

601
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,670
she might target this intersection,
which is both within 30 ft of her and

602
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
which is both within 30 ft of her and
 

603
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,750
which is both within 30 ft of her and
there is an unobstructed path from her

604
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
there is an unobstructed path from her
 

605
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,870
there is an unobstructed path from her
to it. So, this is valid. And the noise

606
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
to it. So, this is valid. And the noise
 

607
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,030
to it. So, this is valid. And the noise
blast would originate from that point

608
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
blast would originate from that point
 

609
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,910
blast would originate from that point
and affect everything within 10 ft of it

610
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
and affect everything within 10 ft of it
 

611
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,030
and affect everything within 10 ft of it
as we see here. But then we need to

612
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
as we see here. But then we need to
 

613
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,829
as we see here. But then we need to
adjust for line of effect from the point

614
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
adjust for line of effect from the point
 

615
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,870
adjust for line of effect from the point
of origin to each of the goblins. These

616
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
of origin to each of the goblins. These
 

617
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,870
of origin to each of the goblins. These
three have clear line of effect to the

618
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
three have clear line of effect to the
 

619
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,949
three have clear line of effect to the
point of origin and would be affected by

620
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
point of origin and would be affected by
 

621
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,269
point of origin and would be affected by
the spell. The northern goblin is behind

622
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
the spell. The northern goblin is behind
 

623
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,829
the spell. The northern goblin is behind
a closed door which means there is no

624
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
a closed door which means there is no
 

625
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,230
a closed door which means there is no
line of effect to them and would not be

626
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
line of effect to them and would not be
 

627
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,629
line of effect to them and would not be
affected by the spell. Now that might

628
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
affected by the spell. Now that might
 

629
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,430
affected by the spell. Now that might
beg the question of is the door damaged

630
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
beg the question of is the door damaged
 

631
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,910
beg the question of is the door damaged
and if it is destroyed would any damage

632
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
and if it is destroyed would any damage
 

633
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,470
and if it is destroyed would any damage
left over pass on to the goblin standing

634
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
left over pass on to the goblin standing
 

635
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,110
left over pass on to the goblin standing
behind it? And that's a longer

636
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
behind it? And that's a longer
 

637
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,629
behind it? And that's a longer
discussion that's beyond the scope of

638
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
discussion that's beyond the scope of
 

639
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,710
discussion that's beyond the scope of
this video. But the rule specifically

640
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
this video. But the rule specifically
 

641
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,430
this video. But the rule specifically
use an example of a fireball spell and

642
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
use an example of a fireball spell and
 

643
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,910
use an example of a fireball spell and
says that a door would stop all damage

644
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
says that a door would stop all damage
 

645
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,790
says that a door would stop all damage
from it from passing through. But each

646
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
from it from passing through. But each
 

647
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,190
from it from passing through. But each
GM is free to roll however they believe

648
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
GM is free to roll however they believe
 

649
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,750
GM is free to roll however they believe
is most appropriate. Now that just

650
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
is most appropriate. Now that just
 

651
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,910
is most appropriate. Now that just
leaves the goblin in the bottom left. Is

652
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
leaves the goblin in the bottom left. Is
 

653
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,509
leaves the goblin in the bottom left. Is
there a line of effect from the point of

654
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
there a line of effect from the point of
 

655
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,990
there a line of effect from the point of
origin to that goblin? If someone was

656
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
origin to that goblin? If someone was
 

657
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,990
origin to that goblin? If someone was
standing on the point of origin, could

658
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
standing on the point of origin, could
 

659
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,470
standing on the point of origin, could
they shine a flashlight and hit this

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
they shine a flashlight and hit this
 

661
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,710
they shine a flashlight and hit this
goblin? Even though a line from the

662
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
goblin? Even though a line from the
 

663
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,870
goblin? Even though a line from the
intersection does run along the right

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
through a completely open door, I don't
 

669
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,670
through a completely open door, I don't
see this as passing the flashlight test

670
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
see this as passing the flashlight test
 

671
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,990
see this as passing the flashlight test
and would rule that this goblin is safe

672
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
and would rule that this goblin is safe
 

673
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,710
and would rule that this goblin is safe
from the sound burst spell.

674
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
from the sound burst spell.
 

675
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,110
from the sound burst spell.
Next, let's consider the goblins to the

676
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
Next, let's consider the goblins to the
 

677
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,030
Next, let's consider the goblins to the
bottom right of the screen. For our

678
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
bottom right of the screen. For our
 

679
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,509
bottom right of the screen. For our
purposes, we'll assume she is aware all

680
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
purposes, we'll assume she is aware all
 

681
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,910
purposes, we'll assume she is aware all
of these goblins are grouped there, even

682
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
of these goblins are grouped there, even
 

683
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,750
of these goblins are grouped there, even
if she doesn't have line of sight to

684
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
if she doesn't have line of sight to
 

685
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,230
if she doesn't have line of sight to
them. Now, maybe she just crossed that

686
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
them. Now, maybe she just crossed that
 

687
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,990
them. Now, maybe she just crossed that
intersection with her first action and

688
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
intersection with her first action and
 

689
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,990
intersection with her first action and
now she wants to attack them with noise

690
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
now she wants to attack them with noise
 

691
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,949
now she wants to attack them with noise
blast. If she places the 10-ft burst

692
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
blast. If she places the 10-ft burst
 

693
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,750
blast. If she places the 10-ft burst
here, it would hit them all. But

694
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
here, it would hit them all. But
 

695
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,990
here, it would hit them all. But
unfortunately, in order to do that, she

696
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
unfortunately, in order to do that, she
 

697
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,230
unfortunately, in order to do that, she
would need to place the point of origin

698
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
would need to place the point of origin
 

699
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,790
would need to place the point of origin
here at this intersection, which she

700
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
here at this intersection, which she
 

701
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,870
here at this intersection, which she
can't do because she does not have line

702
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
can't do because she does not have line
 

703
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,670
can't do because she does not have line
of effect to that point. She needs to

704
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
of effect to that point. She needs to
 

705
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,670
of effect to that point. She needs to
have an unobstructed path to the point

706
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
have an unobstructed path to the point
 

707
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,230
have an unobstructed path to the point
of origin and that intersection is

708
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
of origin and that intersection is
 

709
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,550
of origin and that intersection is
blocked by a wall. So she would need to

710
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
blocked by a wall. So she would need to
 

711
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,590
blocked by a wall. So she would need to
place the point of origin here and the

712
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
place the point of origin here and the
 

713
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,150
place the point of origin here and the
bottom two goblins would not be within

714
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
bottom two goblins would not be within
 

715
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,069
bottom two goblins would not be within
range of the blast.

716
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079

 

717
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,790

Some spells require you to succeed at an

718
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
Some spells require you to succeed at an
 

719
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,110
Some spells require you to succeed at an
attack role to affect the target. Just

720
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
attack role to affect the target. Just
 

721
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,350
attack role to affect the target. Just
like weapon attacks, spell attack roles

722
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
like weapon attacks, spell attack roles
 

723
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,990
like weapon attacks, spell attack roles
are opposed by the target's armor class.

724
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
are opposed by the target's armor class.
 

725
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,790
are opposed by the target's armor class.
Spell attacks are a type of attack and

726
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
Spell attacks are a type of attack and
 

727
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,550
Spell attacks are a type of attack and
therefore they're modified by any

728
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
therefore they're modified by any
 

729
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,110
therefore they're modified by any
bonuses or penalties that affect attack

730
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
bonuses or penalties that affect attack
 

731
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,550
bonuses or penalties that affect attack
roles. For example, victims of a bane

732
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
roles. For example, victims of a bane
 

733
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,030
roles. For example, victims of a bane
spell suffer a negative one penalty to

734
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
spell suffer a negative one penalty to
 

735
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,550
spell suffer a negative one penalty to
all attack roles. This does include

736
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
all attack roles. This does include
 

737
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,110
all attack roles. This does include
spell attack roles, too. Whatever

738
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
spell attack roles, too. Whatever
 

739
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,350
spell attack roles, too. Whatever
effects say that they modify just

740
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
effects say that they modify just
 

741
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,910
effects say that they modify just
attacks without specifying a specific

742
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
attacks without specifying a specific
 

743
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,790
attacks without specifying a specific
type of attack, they affect spell

744
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
type of attack, they affect spell
 

745
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,350
type of attack, they affect spell
attacks, too. But if the effect calls

746
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
attacks, too. But if the effect calls
 

747
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,670
attacks, too. But if the effect calls
out a specific type of attack like

748
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
out a specific type of attack like
 

749
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,670
out a specific type of attack like
weapon attacks, then obviously those

750
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
weapon attacks, then obviously those
 

751
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,470
weapon attacks, then obviously those
would not apply to spell attacks. Now,

752
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
would not apply to spell attacks. Now,
 

753
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,949
would not apply to spell attacks. Now,
one specific penalty that definitely

754
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
one specific penalty that definitely
 

755
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,430
one specific penalty that definitely
needs to be discussed is the multiple

756
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
needs to be discussed is the multiple
 

757
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,710
needs to be discussed is the multiple
attack penalty. This applies to all

758
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
attack penalty. This applies to all
 

759
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,189
attack penalty. This applies to all
actions with the attack trait. For

760
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
actions with the attack trait. For
 

761
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,910
actions with the attack trait. For
example, divine lance requires a spell

762
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
example, divine lance requires a spell
 

763
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,710
example, divine lance requires a spell
attack role and has the attack trait.

764
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
attack role and has the attack trait.
 

765
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,430
attack role and has the attack trait.
Therefore, it is affected by and

766
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
Therefore, it is affected by and
 

767
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,509
Therefore, it is affected by and
contributes to the multiple attack

768
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
contributes to the multiple attack
 

769
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,750
contributes to the multiple attack
penalty. When making a spell attack

770
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760
penalty. When making a spell attack
 

771
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,990
penalty. When making a spell attack
roll, your modifier is equal to your

772
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
roll, your modifier is equal to your
 

773
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,629
roll, your modifier is equal to your
spell-casting ability modifier plus your

774
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
spell-casting ability modifier plus your
 

775
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,269
spell-casting ability modifier plus your
spell-casting proficiency bonus. The

776
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
spell-casting proficiency bonus. The
 

777
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,829
spell-casting proficiency bonus. The
ability modifier that is used depends on

778
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
ability modifier that is used depends on
 

779
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,910
ability modifier that is used depends on
how you gain access to the spell you're

780
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
how you gain access to the spell you're
 

781
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,150
how you gain access to the spell you're
casting. If your class granted the

782
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
casting. If your class granted the
 

783
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,470
casting. If your class granted the
ability to cast the spell, then you use

784
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
ability to cast the spell, then you use
 

785
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,310
ability to cast the spell, then you use
that class's spell-casting ability

786
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
that class's spell-casting ability
 

787
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,189
that class's spell-casting ability
modifier, which is often the class's key

788
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
modifier, which is often the class's key
 

789
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,389
modifier, which is often the class's key
ability modifier. Bars and sorcerers use

790
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
ability modifier. Bars and sorcerers use
 

791
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,870
ability modifier. Bars and sorcerers use
charisma. Clerics and druids use wisdom.

792
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
charisma. Clerics and druids use wisdom.
 

793
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,030
charisma. Clerics and druids use wisdom.
Witches and wizards use intelligence,

794
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
Witches and wizards use intelligence,
 

795
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,629
Witches and wizards use intelligence,
and so on.

charisma modifier. And other sources of
spells can specify what ability modifier

804
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
spells can specify what ability modifier
 

805
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,069
spells can specify what ability modifier
to use for their spells. But the rule of

806
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
to use for their spells. But the rule of
 

807
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,230
to use for their spells. But the rule of
thumb is when in doubt, use charisma.

808
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
thumb is when in doubt, use charisma.
 

809

thumb is when in doubt, use charisma.
And this can lead to situations where a

And this can lead to situations where a
 

811
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,269
And this can lead to situations where a
caster uses different ability modifiers

812
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
caster uses different ability modifiers
 

813
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,389
caster uses different ability modifiers
to cast different spells. For example, a

814
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
to cast different spells. For example, a
 

815
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,870
to cast different spells. For example, a
cleric would use their wisdom modifier

816
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
cleric would use their wisdom modifier
 

817
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,030
cleric would use their wisdom modifier
when casting divine spells granted by

when casting divine spells granted by

when casting divine spells granted by
their class, but would use charisma when

their class, but would use charisma when

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,550
their class, but would use charisma when
casting innate spells. And if that

822
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
casting innate spells. And if that
 

823
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,189
casting innate spells. And if that
cleric was also multiclust into wizard,

824
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
cleric was also multiclust into wizard,
 

825
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,350
cleric was also multiclust into wizard,
then they would use intelligence as the

826
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
then they would use intelligence as the
 

827
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,389
then they would use intelligence as the
modifier for their arcane wizard spells.

828
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
modifier for their arcane wizard spells.
 

829
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,550
modifier for their arcane wizard spells.

virtually all cases, they will be the
same. Each spell will detail what

same. Each spell will detail what
 

867
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,510
same. Each spell will detail what
happens on a hit or miss. For example,

868
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
happens on a hit or miss. For example,
 

869
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,230
happens on a hit or miss. For example,
divine lance deals 2d4 spirit damage on

divine lance deals 2d4 spirit damage on
 

871

divine lance deals 2d4 spirit damage on
a hit. On a critical hit, you would

872
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
a hit. On a critical hit, you would
 

873
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,029
a hit. On a critical hit, you would
double this to 44 damage, and nothing

the same as the caster spell DC, which

as to what happens on a successful or
failed save, or it will refer to it as a

failed save, or it will refer to it as a
 

911
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,669
failed save, or it will refer to it as a
quote basic saving throw. These are very

912
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
quote basic saving throw. These are very
 

913
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,150
quote basic saving throw. These are very
common for damaging effects. And what

914
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
common for damaging effects. And what
 

915
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,870
common for damaging effects. And what
basic saving throw means is if you

916
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
basic saving throw means is if you
 

917
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,070
basic saving throw means is if you
succeed, you only suffer half the listed

918
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
succeed, you only suffer half the listed
 

919
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,549
succeed, you only suffer half the listed
damage. If you critically succeed, you

damage. If you critically succeed, you
 

921
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,590
damage. If you critically succeed, you
take no damage. If you fail, you take

922
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
take no damage. If you fail, you take
 

923
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,909
take no damage. If you fail, you take
normal damage. And if you critically

924

normal damage. And if you critically
 

925
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,710
normal damage. And if you critically
fail, you suffer double damage. With

926
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
fail, you suffer double damage. With
 

927
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,510
fail, you suffer double damage. With
that in mind, let's look at a few common

928
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
that in mind, let's look at a few common
 

929
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,549
that in mind, let's look at a few common
examples. Fireball calls for a basic

930
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
examples. Fireball calls for a basic
 

931
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,190
examples. Fireball calls for a basic
saving throw. When cast, all targets in

932
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
saving throw. When cast, all targets in
 

933
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,390
saving throw. When cast, all targets in
the burst area must each roll a reflex

934
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
the burst area must each roll a reflex
 

935
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,029
the burst area must each roll a reflex
saving throw versus the caster's spell

936
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
saving throw versus the caster's spell
 

937
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,669
saving throw versus the caster's spell
DC. On a success, they suffer half

938
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
DC. On a success, they suffer half
 

939
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,070
DC. On a success, they suffer half
damage. On a failure, they take full

940
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
damage. On a failure, they take full
 

941
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,470
damage. On a failure, they take full
damage. On a critical success, they take

942
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
damage. On a critical success, they take
 

943
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,270
damage. On a critical success, they take
no damage. And on a critical failure,

944
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
no damage. And on a critical failure,
 

945
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,070
no damage. And on a critical failure,
they suffer double damage. You would

946
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
they suffer double damage. You would
 

947
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,470
they suffer double damage. You would
only roll the damage once though and

948
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
only roll the damage once though and
 

949
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,669
only roll the damage once though and
apply that damage total individually to

950
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
apply that damage total individually to
 

951
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,310
apply that damage total individually to
each target depending on their reflex

952
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
each target depending on their reflex
 

953
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,070
each target depending on their reflex
saves level of success or failure.

954
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
saves level of success or failure.
 

955
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,830
saves level of success or failure.
All right, now let's break this down

956
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
All right, now let's break this down
 

957
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,390
All right, now let's break this down
with a couple of more examples to

958
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
with a couple of more examples to
 

959
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,350
with a couple of more examples to
illustrate all of this. Valon is a first

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
illustrate all of this. Valon is a first
 

961
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,909
illustrate all of this. Valon is a first
level elven cloistered cleric of Abidor.

962

the goblin. First, we need to calculate
 

977
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,789
the goblin. First, we need to calculate
his spell attack bonus, which is ability

978
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
his spell attack bonus, which is ability
 

979
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,909

modifier, and he has trained proficiency
in spell attack. Train proficiency is

988
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
in spell attack. Train proficiency is
 

989
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,590
in spell attack. Train proficiency is
two plus level. He's first level, so

990
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
two plus level. He's first level, so
 

991
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,230
two plus level. He's first level, so
that's one more for a total spell attack

992
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
that's one more for a total spell attack
 

993
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,750
that's one more for a total spell attack
bonus of plus six. When he casts the

994
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
bonus of plus six. When he casts the
 

995
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,390
bonus of plus six. When he casts the
spell, he makes a ranged spell attack

spell, he makes a ranged spell attack
 

997
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,230
spell, he makes a ranged spell attack
roll 1d20 + 6. And that total is

998
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
roll 1d20 + 6. And that total is
 

999
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,630
roll 1d20 + 6. And that total is
compared to the goblin's armor class of

1000
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
compared to the goblin's armor class of
 

1001
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,230
compared to the goblin's armor class of
17. We'll say he rolls an 11 on the die

1002
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
17. We'll say he rolls an 11 on the die
 

1003
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,870
17. We'll say he rolls an 11 on the die
for a total of 17, which is just enough

1004
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
for a total of 17, which is just enough
 

1005
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,750
for a total of 17, which is just enough
to hit the goblin. Then on the next

1006
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
to hit the goblin. Then on the next
 

1007
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,470
to hit the goblin. Then on the next
round, Valon attempts to cast Infeeble

1008
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
round, Valon attempts to cast Infeeble
 

1009
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,270
round, Valon attempts to cast Infeeble
on the goblin. In this case, Valon will

1010
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
on the goblin. In this case, Valon will
 

1011
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,149
on the goblin. In this case, Valon will
not make a spell attack roll and instead

1012
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
not make a spell attack roll and instead
 

1013
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,710
not make a spell attack roll and instead
the Goblin will need to pass a fortitude

1014
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
the Goblin will need to pass a fortitude
 

1015
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,510
the Goblin will need to pass a fortitude
save. The DC for this save will be

1016
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
save. The DC for this save will be
 

1017
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,630
save. The DC for this save will be
Valon's divine spell DC. To calculate

1018
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
Valon's divine spell DC. To calculate
 

1019
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,270
Valon's divine spell DC. To calculate
this, you simply add 10 to his spell

1020
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
this, you simply add 10 to his spell
 

1021
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,470
this, you simply add 10 to his spell
attack bonus of plus six for a DC of 16.

1022
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
attack bonus of plus six for a DC of 16.
 

1023
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,710
attack bonus of plus six for a DC of 16.
Now the goblin must roll a fortitude

1024
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
Now the goblin must roll a fortitude
 

1025
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,590
Now the goblin must roll a fortitude
save and meet or beat balance divine

1026
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
save and meet or beat balance divine
 

1027
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,830
save and meet or beat balance divine
spell DC of 16 to succeed. On a success,

1028
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
spell DC of 16 to succeed. On a success,
 

1029
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,630
spell DC of 16 to succeed. On a success,
the goblin becomes infeebled one. On a

1030
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
the goblin becomes infeebled one. On a
 

1031
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,190
the goblin becomes infeebled one. On a
failure, they're infeebled two. On a

1032
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
failure, they're infeebled two. On a
 

1033
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,510
failure, they're infeebled two. On a
critical success, nothing happens. And

1034
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
critical success, nothing happens. And
 

1035
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,750
critical success, nothing happens. And
on a critical failure, the goblin

1036
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
on a critical failure, the goblin
 

1037
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,270
on a critical failure, the goblin
becomes infeebled three.

1038
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
becomes infeebled three.
 

1039
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,350
becomes infeebled three.
Let's fast forward a little bit. And now

1040
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
Let's fast forward a little bit. And now
 

1041
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,549
Let's fast forward a little bit. And now
Valon is third level. The first thing we

1042
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
Valon is third level. The first thing we
 

1043
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,630
Valon is third level. The first thing we
want to do is adjust his divine spell

1044
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
want to do is adjust his divine spell
 

1045
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,590
want to do is adjust his divine spell
attack bonus and DC. Since those are

1046
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
attack bonus and DC. Since those are
 

1047
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,830
attack bonus and DC. Since those are
both based on proficiency, and

1048
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:47,840
both based on proficiency, and
 

1049
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,390
both based on proficiency, and
proficiency increases with level, his

1050
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
proficiency increases with level, his
 

1051
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,110
proficiency increases with level, his
divine spell attack bonus is now plus 8,

1052
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
divine spell attack bonus is now plus 8,
 

1053
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,070
divine spell attack bonus is now plus 8,
and that means his divine spell DC is

1054
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
and that means his divine spell DC is
 

1055
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,270
and that means his divine spell DC is
18. Also, at third level, he gets to

1056
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
18. Also, at third level, he gets to
 

1057
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,789
18. Also, at third level, he gets to
increase one skill to expert

1058
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
increase one skill to expert
 

1059
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,190
increase one skill to expert
proficiency. He chooses to boost his

1060
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200

1061
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,029

1063
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,230
religion skill to expert, which
increases his religion bonus to plus 10.

1064
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
increases his religion bonus to plus 10.
 

1065
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,789
increases his religion bonus to plus 10.
This increase to expert proficiency with

1066
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
This increase to expert proficiency with
 

1067
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,310
This increase to expert proficiency with
religion has no impact at all on his

1068
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
religion has no impact at all on his
 

1069
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,430
religion has no impact at all on his
divine spell attack bonus or DC. Even

though religion is the key skill for

though religion is the key skill for
 

1073
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,149
though religion is the key skill for
divine magic, it is wholly separate from

1074
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
divine magic, it is wholly separate from
 

1075
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,390
divine magic, it is wholly separate from

spell-casting proficiency and valance
 

1077
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,390
spell-casting proficiency and valance
spell-casting proficiency level is

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
spell-casting proficiency level is
 

1079
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,350
spell-casting proficiency level is
trained. Now, let's fast forward again

1080
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
trained. Now, let's fast forward again
 

1081
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,470
trained. Now, let's fast forward again
to fifth level. Every time you increase

1082
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
to fifth level. Every time you increase
 

1083
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,549
to fifth level. Every time you increase
level, you need to adjust your spell

1084
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
level, you need to adjust your spell
 

1085
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,430
level, you need to adjust your spell
attack bonus and DC. But before we do

1086
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
attack bonus and DC. But before we do
 

1087
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,990
attack bonus and DC. But before we do
that, there are a couple other things to

1088
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
that, there are a couple other things to
 

1089
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,549
that, there are a couple other things to
consider. First, at fifth level, you get

1090
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
consider. First, at fifth level, you get
 

1091
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,270
consider. First, at fifth level, you get
to increase four of your ability scores.

1092
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
to increase four of your ability scores.
 

1093
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,510
to increase four of your ability scores.
Valon chooses decks, intelligence,

1094
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
Valon chooses decks, intelligence,
 

1095
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,070
Valon chooses decks, intelligence,
wisdom, and charisma. This changes his

1096
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
wisdom, and charisma. This changes his
 

1097
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,990
wisdom, and charisma. This changes his
final ability scores to plus three

1098
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
final ability scores to plus three
 

1099
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,630
final ability scores to plus three
intelligence, plus four wisdom, and plus

1100
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
intelligence, plus four wisdom, and plus
 

1101
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,510
intelligence, plus four wisdom, and plus
two charisma. Next, we need to adjust

1102
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
two charisma. Next, we need to adjust
 

1103
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,750
two charisma. Next, we need to adjust
his divine spell-casting attack bonus

1104
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
his divine spell-casting attack bonus
 

1105
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,710
his divine spell-casting attack bonus
and DC. The calculation is ability

1106
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
and DC. The calculation is ability
 

1107
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,750
and DC. The calculation is ability
modifier plus proficiency. His wisdom

1108
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
modifier plus proficiency. His wisdom
 

1109
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,110
modifier plus proficiency. His wisdom
bonus is plus4 and train proficiency is

1110
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
bonus is plus4 and train proficiency is
 

1111
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,470
bonus is plus4 and train proficiency is
two plus level. Four + two plus fifth

1112
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
two plus level. Four + two plus fifth
 

1113
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,350
two plus level. Four + two plus fifth
level grants a final divine spell attack

1114
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
level grants a final divine spell attack
 

1115
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,230
level grants a final divine spell attack
bonus of plus 11 and that makes his

1116
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
bonus of plus 11 and that makes his
 

1117
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,990
bonus of plus 11 and that makes his

divine spell DC 21. Also at fifth
leveling gets to choose a new ancestry

1120
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
leveling gets to choose a new ancestry
 

1121
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,149
leveling gets to choose a new ancestry
feat. He selects otherworldly magic

1122
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
feat. He selects otherworldly magic
 

1123
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,029
feat. He selects otherworldly magic
which lets him cast one arcane cantrip

1124
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039
which lets him cast one arcane cantrip
 

1125
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,070
which lets him cast one arcane cantrip
as an innate spell. He chooses electric

1126
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
as an innate spell. He chooses electric
 

1127
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,630
as an innate spell. He chooses electric
arc as that spell. And since this is an

1128
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
arc as that spell. And since this is an
 

1129
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,190
arc as that spell. And since this is an
innate spell, he does not cast it with

1130
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
innate spell, he does not cast it with
 

1131
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,510
innate spell, he does not cast it with
the same bonuses he uses for cleric

1132
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
the same bonuses he uses for cleric
 

1133
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,230
the same bonuses he uses for cleric
divine spells. Those are based on wisdom

1134
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
divine spells. Those are based on wisdom
 

1135
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,950
divine spells. Those are based on wisdom
as the key ability modifier, but innate

1136
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
as the key ability modifier, but innate
 

1137
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,750
as the key ability modifier, but innate
spells use charisma. So, let's calculate

1138
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
spells use charisma. So, let's calculate
 

1139
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,430
spells use charisma. So, let's calculate
his spell DC for electric arc. Spell DC

1140
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
his spell DC for electric arc. Spell DC
 

1141
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,230
his spell DC for electric arc. Spell DC
is 10 plus spell attack. So, let's start

1142
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
is 10 plus spell attack. So, let's start
 

1143
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,110
is 10 plus spell attack. So, let's start
there. Spell attack is ability modifier

1144
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
there. Spell attack is ability modifier
 

1145
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,909
there. Spell attack is ability modifier
plus proficiency. His charisma bonus is

1146
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
plus proficiency. His charisma bonus is
 

1147
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,710
plus proficiency. His charisma bonus is
plus two. And he has trained proficiency

1148
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
plus two. And he has trained proficiency
 

1149
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,430
plus two. And he has trained proficiency
with spell attacks and DCs, which is two

1150
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
with spell attacks and DCs, which is two
 

1151
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,390
with spell attacks and DCs, which is two
plus level. So two for charisma, plus

1152
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
plus level. So two for charisma, plus
 

1153
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,350
plus level. So two for charisma, plus
two for trained, plus five for level

1154
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
two for trained, plus five for level
 

1155
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,310
two for trained, plus five for level
equals a final innate spell bonus of

1156
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
equals a final innate spell bonus of
 

1157
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,590
equals a final innate spell bonus of
plus 9. And 10 more than that makes an

1158
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
plus 9. And 10 more than that makes an
 

1159
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,590
plus 9. And 10 more than that makes an
innate spell DC of 19. So to sum up,

1160
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
innate spell DC of 19. So to sum up,
 

1161
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,669
innate spell DC of 19. So to sum up,
when Valon casts a spell from the divine

1162
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
when Valon casts a spell from the divine
 

1163
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,990
when Valon casts a spell from the divine
spell list, he has a spell attack bonus

1165
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,350
spell list, he has a spell attack bonus
of plus 11 and spell DC of 21. But when

1166
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
of plus 11 and spell DC of 21. But when
 

1167
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,430
of plus 11 and spell DC of 21. But when
he casts electric arc, which is his

1168
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
he casts electric arc, which is his
 

1169
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,590
he casts electric arc, which is his
innate spell, he has a spell attack

1170
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
innate spell, he has a spell attack
 

1171
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,870
innate spell, he has a spell attack
bonus of plus 9 and spell DC of 19.

1172
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
bonus of plus 9 and spell DC of 19.
 

1173
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,430
bonus of plus 9 and spell DC of 19.
Let's jump forward one more time to

1174
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
Let's jump forward one more time to
 

1175

1233
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,549
with a spell DC of 23. The reason why
it's 23 and not 21 is because when you
