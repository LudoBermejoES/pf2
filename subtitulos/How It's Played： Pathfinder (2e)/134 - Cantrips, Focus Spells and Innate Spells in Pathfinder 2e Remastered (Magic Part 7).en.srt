00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,270
part 7. So far in this series, we've
mainly discussed spells that consume

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
mainly discussed spells that consume
 

9
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,990
mainly discussed spells that consume
spell slots or what we might call

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
spell slots or what we might call
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,910
spell slots or what we might call
regular spells for a lack of a better

term. And in this video, we're going to

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,950
term. And in this video, we're going to
expand that discussion to include other

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
expand that discussion to include other
 

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,750
expand that discussion to include other
types of spells, including focus spells,

18
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
types of spells, including focus spells,
 

19
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,109
types of spells, including focus spells,
innate spells, and cantrips.

20
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
innate spells, and cantrips.
 

21
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,429
innate spells, and cantrips.
A cantrip is a special kind of spell

22
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
A cantrip is a special kind of spell
 

23
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,990
A cantrip is a special kind of spell
that is usually a little bit weaker than

24
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
that is usually a little bit weaker than
 

25
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,310
that is usually a little bit weaker than
regular spells, but can be cast more

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
regular spells, but can be cast more
 

27
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,630
regular spells, but can be cast more
often and with greater flexibility.

28
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
often and with greater flexibility.
 

29
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,630
often and with greater flexibility.
There are two key features of cantrips

30
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
There are two key features of cantrips
 

31
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,869
There are two key features of cantrips
that separate them from other spells.

32
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
that separate them from other spells.
 

33
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,470
that separate them from other spells.
First, cantrips do not use spell slots

34
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
First, cantrips do not use spell slots
 

35
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,950
First, cantrips do not use spell slots
and therefore can be cast at will an

36
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
and therefore can be cast at will an
 

37
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,590
and therefore can be cast at will an
unlimited number of times per day. For

38
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
unlimited number of times per day. For
 

39
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,790
unlimited number of times per day. For
example, electric arc. Cantrips have

40
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
example, electric arc. Cantrips have
 

41
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,270
example, electric arc. Cantrips have
minimum casting ranks just like regular

42
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
minimum casting ranks just like regular
 

43
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,990
minimum casting ranks just like regular
spells. And we can see here electric arc

44
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
spells. And we can see here electric arc
 

45
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,869
spells. And we can see here electric arc
has a minimum casting rank of one.

46
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
has a minimum casting rank of one.
 

47
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,990
has a minimum casting rank of one.
That's by far the norm. But there are

48
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
That's by far the norm. But there are
 

49
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,469
That's by far the norm. But there are
times when a cantrip will have a higher

50
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
times when a cantrip will have a higher
 

51
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,109
times when a cantrip will have a higher
minimum casting rank. For example, Durge

52
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
minimum casting rank. For example, Durge
 

53
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,590
minimum casting rank. For example, Durge
of Doom. This is a cantrip available to

54
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
of Doom. This is a cantrip available to
 

55
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,310
of Doom. This is a cantrip available to
barge that has a minimum casting rank of

56
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
barge that has a minimum casting rank of
 

57
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,109
barge that has a minimum casting rank of
third. Although cantrips don't use spell

58
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
third. Although cantrips don't use spell
 

59
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,670
third. Although cantrips don't use spell
slots, these rank requirements reflect

60
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
slots, these rank requirements reflect
 

61
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,590
slots, these rank requirements reflect
the minimum spell slot you're able to

62
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
the minimum spell slot you're able to
 

63
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,630
the minimum spell slot you're able to
cast. So you would need to be at least a

64
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
cast. So you would need to be at least a
 

65
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,789
cast. So you would need to be at least a
fifth level bard who is able to cast

66
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
fifth level bard who is able to cast
 

67
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,190
fifth level bard who is able to cast
third rank spells in order to cast Durge

68
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
third rank spells in order to cast Durge
 

69
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,149
third rank spells in order to cast Durge
of Doom. Even though it is a cantrip,

70
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
of Doom. Even though it is a cantrip,
 

71
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,390
of Doom. Even though it is a cantrip,
that's pretty much the same as regular

72
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
that's pretty much the same as regular
 

73
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,310
that's pretty much the same as regular
spells, but what's different is since

74
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
spells, but what's different is since
 

75
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,190
spells, but what's different is since
this is a cantrip, it can be cast an

76
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
this is a cantrip, it can be cast an
 

77
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,590
this is a cantrip, it can be cast an
unlimited number of times each day and

78
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
unlimited number of times each day and
 

79
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,429
unlimited number of times each day and
does not consume any spell slots when

80
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
does not consume any spell slots when
 

81
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,910
does not consume any spell slots when
doing so. The second key feature of

82
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
doing so. The second key feature of
 

83
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,469
doing so. The second key feature of
cantrips is that they are automatically

84
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
cantrips is that they are automatically
 

85
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,630
cantrips is that they are automatically
heightened to half the caster's level

86
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
heightened to half the caster's level
 

87
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,950
heightened to half the caster's level
rounded up. In the case of most

88
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
rounded up. In the case of most
 

89
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,710
rounded up. In the case of most
spell-casting classes, this means you

90
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
spell-casting classes, this means you
 

91
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,789
spell-casting classes, this means you
can cast your cantrips at the same rank

92
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
can cast your cantrips at the same rank
 

93
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,910
can cast your cantrips at the same rank
as your highest spell slots. So, if

94
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
as your highest spell slots. So, if
 

95
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,149
as your highest spell slots. So, if
fifth rank spells are the highest rank

96
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
fifth rank spells are the highest rank
 

97
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,230
fifth rank spells are the highest rank
spells you can cast, you can cast your

98
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
spells you can cast, you can cast your
 

99
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,030
spells you can cast, you can cast your
cantrips at fifth rank too. That makes

100
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
cantrips at fifth rank too. That makes
 

101
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,749
cantrips at fifth rank too. That makes
this very easy to remember, but may not

102
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
this very easy to remember, but may not
 

103
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,990
this very easy to remember, but may not
apply if you don't belong to one of the

104
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
apply if you don't belong to one of the
 

105
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,150
apply if you don't belong to one of the
full spell-casting classes or receive

106
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
full spell-casting classes or receive
 

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,990
full spell-casting classes or receive
your spells from an archetype or some

108
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
your spells from an archetype or some
 

109
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,869
your spells from an archetype or some
other source. For spontaneous casters,

110
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
other source. For spontaneous casters,
 

111
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,790
other source. For spontaneous casters,
this means cantrips work like signature

112
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
this means cantrips work like signature
 

113
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,470
this means cantrips work like signature
spells in that they are freely

114
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
spells in that they are freely
 

115
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,309
spells in that they are freely
heightened, but still need to be

116
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
heightened, but still need to be
 

117
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,030
heightened, but still need to be
included in their spell repertoire. And

118
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
included in their spell repertoire. And
 

119
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,630
included in their spell repertoire. And
prepared spellcasters still need to

120
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
prepared spellcasters still need to
 

121
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,309
prepared spellcasters still need to
prepare their cantrips before they can

122
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
prepare their cantrips before they can
 

123
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,110
prepare their cantrips before they can
be cast. But once they're prepared or in

124
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
be cast. But once they're prepared or in
 

125
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,270
be cast. But once they're prepared or in
a spell rope patrol, the caners can be

126
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
a spell rope patrol, the caners can be
 

127
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,589
a spell rope patrol, the caners can be
cast as often as the player likes.

128
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
cast as often as the player likes.
 

129
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,750
cast as often as the player likes.
Focus spells are a special kind of spell

130
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
Focus spells are a special kind of spell
 

131
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,430
Focus spells are a special kind of spell
that is granted by certain class

132
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
that is granted by certain class
 

133
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,589
that is granted by certain class
features and feats. Just like with

134
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
features and feats. Just like with
 

135
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,190
features and feats. Just like with
cantrips, they're automatically

136
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
cantrips, they're automatically
 

137
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,110
cantrips, they're automatically
heightened to a rank that is half your

heightened to a rank that is half your
 

139
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,430
heightened to a rank that is half your
level rounded up and do not use spell

140
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
level rounded up and do not use spell
 

141
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,589
level rounded up and do not use spell
slots when they're cast. Instead, the

142
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
slots when they're cast. Instead, the
 

143
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,309
slots when they're cast. Instead, the
caster must spend a focus point to cast

144
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
caster must spend a focus point to cast
 

145
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,589
caster must spend a focus point to cast
a focus spell. Your focus pool capacity

146
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
a focus spell. Your focus pool capacity
 

147
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,750
a focus spell. Your focus pool capacity
automatically equals the total number of

148
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
automatically equals the total number of
 

149
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,390
automatically equals the total number of
spells you know that cost focus points

150
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
spells you know that cost focus points
 

151
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,190
spells you know that cost focus points
up to a maximum cap of three focus

152
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
up to a maximum cap of three focus
 

153
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,830
up to a maximum cap of three focus
points. And note that it says spells

154
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
points. And note that it says spells
 

155
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,110
points. And note that it says spells
that cost focus points. Not all focus

156
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
that cost focus points. Not all focus
 

157
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,589
that cost focus points. Not all focus
spells cost focus points. For example,

158
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
spells cost focus points. For example,
 

159
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,670
spells cost focus points. For example,
bards and witches both have focus

160
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
bards and witches both have focus
 

161
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,630
bards and witches both have focus
cantrips. Only focus spells that cost

162
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
