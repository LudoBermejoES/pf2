Now, Fabula Ultima and Pathfinder 2e are

00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
Now, Fabula Ultima and Pathfinder 2e are
 

63
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,469
Now, Fabula Ultima and Pathfinder 2e are
different systems, so a direct port

64
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
different systems, so a direct port
 

65
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,350
different systems, so a direct port
doesn't work. What follows is a

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
doesn't work. What follows is a
 

67
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,590
doesn't work. What follows is a
framework for adapting this concept

68
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
framework for adapting this concept
 

69
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,910
framework for adapting this concept
using Pathfinder 2's existing mechanics

70
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
using Pathfinder 2's existing mechanics
 

71
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,630
using Pathfinder 2's existing mechanics
as building blocks. So, it's important

72
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
as building blocks. So, it's important
 

73
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,910
as building blocks. So, it's important
to note this is not official Piso

74
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
to note this is not official Piso
 

75
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,789
to note this is not official Piso
material and is just my attempt to apply

76
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
material and is just my attempt to apply
 

77
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,910
material and is just my attempt to apply
Fabula Ultima's concepts to Pathfinder.

78
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
Fabula Ultima's concepts to Pathfinder.
 

79
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,310
Fabula Ultima's concepts to Pathfinder.
As such, this is strictly fan-made

85
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,910
tested, and your mileage may vary. So,
think of this video as a fun thought

86
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
think of this video as a fun thought
 

87
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,910
think of this video as a fun thought
experiment instead of being hard rules.

So, what's the basic idea in Fabula

90
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
So, what's the basic idea in Fabula
 

91
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,310
So, what's the basic idea in Fabula
Ultima? Well, a multi-art opponent is a

92
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
Ultima? Well, a multi-art opponent is a
 

93
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,630
Ultima? Well, a multi-art opponent is a
single, often very large creature

94
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
single, often very large creature
 

95
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,430
single, often very large creature
treated as multiple distinct enemies in

treated as multiple distinct enemies in
 

97
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,270
treated as multiple distinct enemies in
terms of targeting and sometimes

98
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
terms of targeting and sometimes
 

99
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,229
terms of targeting and sometimes
defense. You might have a head, claws, a

100
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
defense. You might have a head, claws, a
 

101
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,550
defense. You might have a head, claws, a
tail, maybe some turrets on a techno

102
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
tail, maybe some turrets on a techno
 

103
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,710
tail, maybe some turrets on a techno
fantasy construct. The key is that

104
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
fantasy construct. The key is that
 

105
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,110
fantasy construct. The key is that
targeting and destroying each of these

106
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
targeting and destroying each of these
 

107
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,470
targeting and destroying each of these
parts has a direct impact. Maybe it

108
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
parts has a direct impact. Maybe it
 

109
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,030
parts has a direct impact. Maybe it
disables a specific attack, it changes

110
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
disables a specific attack, it changes
 

111
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,110
disables a specific attack, it changes
the creature's stats, or even triggers a

112
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
the creature's stats, or even triggers a
 

113
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,390
the creature's stats, or even triggers a
whole new phase of the fight.

114
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
whole new phase of the fight.
 

115
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,470
whole new phase of the fight.
To bring this into Pathfinder, we'll

116
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
To bring this into Pathfinder, we'll
 

117
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,630
To bring this into Pathfinder, we'll
need a framework that pulls inspiration

118
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
need a framework that pulls inspiration
 

119
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,430
need a framework that pulls inspiration
from Fabula Ultima, but still respects

120
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
from Fabula Ultima, but still respects
 

121
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,630
from Fabula Ultima, but still respects
Pathfinder's rules. First, your creature

122
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
Pathfinder's rules. First, your creature
 

123
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,750
Pathfinder's rules. First, your creature
still has a primary stat block. Armor

124
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
still has a primary stat block. Armor
 

125
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,150
still has a primary stat block. Armor
class, saves, skills, perception speed,

126
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
class, saves, skills, perception speed,
 

127
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,229
class, saves, skills, perception speed,
resistances, weaknesses, all of that

128
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
resistances, weaknesses, all of that
 

129
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,750
resistances, weaknesses, all of that
good stuff. It also has a main hit point

130
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
good stuff. It also has a main hit point
 

131
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,110
good stuff. It also has a main hit point
pull. This represents its overall life

132
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
pull. This represents its overall life
 

133
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,990
pull. This represents its overall life
force. Usually, the creature is only

134
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
force. Usually, the creature is only
 

135
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,470
force. Usually, the creature is only
truly defeated when this main hit points

136
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
truly defeated when this main hit points
 

137
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,509
truly defeated when this main hit points
pull hits zero. And to differentiate

138
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
pull hits zero. And to differentiate
 

139
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,390
pull hits zero. And to differentiate
this from the monster's different parts.

140
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
this from the monster's different parts.
 

141
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,470
this from the monster's different parts.
I'm going to refer to this as the

142
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm going to refer to this as the
 

143
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,670
I'm going to refer to this as the
monster's main body. In addition, the

144
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
monster's main body. In addition, the
 

145
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,830
monster's main body. In addition, the
monster will have a number of parts.

146
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
monster will have a number of parts.
 

147
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,990
monster will have a number of parts.
Think head, claws, tails, wings, power

148
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
Think head, claws, tails, wings, power
 

149
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,670
Think head, claws, tails, wings, power
core, and so on. Each part has its own

150
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
core, and so on. Each part has its own
 

151
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,229
core, and so on. Each part has its own
separate hit points pull. And this is

152
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
separate hit points pull. And this is
 

153
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,270
separate hit points pull. And this is
key. Think of it as the durability of

154
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
key. Think of it as the durability of
 

155
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,789
key. Think of it as the durability of
just that one component. Maybe it has

156
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
just that one component. Maybe it has
 

157
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,910
just that one component. Maybe it has
25% to as much as 50% of the creature's

158
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
25% to as much as 50% of the creature's
 

159
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,910
25% to as much as 50% of the creature's
main hit points. That's usually a good

160
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
main hit points. That's usually a good
 

161
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,910
main hit points. That's usually a good
starting point depending on how many

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,910
starting point depending on how many
parts there are and the purpose of each

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
parts there are and the purpose of each
 

165
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,949
parts there are and the purpose of each
part. Each part is also going to have

166
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
part. Each part is also going to have
 

167
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,910
part. Each part is also going to have
abilities. Tie specific strikes,

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
abilities. Tie specific strikes,
 

169
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,229
abilities. Tie specific strikes,
activities, reactions, or even passive

activities, reactions, or even passive
abilities to each part. A claw lists the

172
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
abilities to each part. A claw lists the
 

173
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,229
abilities to each part. A claw lists the
monster grab. The head has a breath

174
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
monster grab. The head has a breath
 

175
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,589
monster grab. The head has a breath
weapon and so on. If the part is broken,

176
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
weapon and so on. If the part is broken,
 

177
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,229
weapon and so on. If the part is broken,
then that ability goes away. And

178
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
then that ability goes away. And
 

179
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,030
then that ability goes away. And
optionally, you can add part defenses.

180
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
optionally, you can add part defenses.
 

181
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,710
optionally, you can add part defenses.
You could give parts slightly different

182
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
You could give parts slightly different
 

183
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,710
You could give parts slightly different
armor classes or unique weaknesses and

184
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
armor classes or unique weaknesses and
 

185
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,190
armor classes or unique weaknesses and
resistances compared to what the main

186
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
resistances compared to what the main
 

187
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,470
resistances compared to what the main
body has. For example, armored legs

188
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
body has. For example, armored legs
 

189
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,710
body has. For example, armored legs
might resist physical damage better than

190
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
might resist physical damage better than
 

191
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,509
might resist physical damage better than
the monster's fleshy torso does. But to

192
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
the monster's fleshy torso does. But to
 

193
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,590
the monster's fleshy torso does. But to
keep things simple at first, I recommend

194
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
keep things simple at first, I recommend
 

195
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,349
keep things simple at first, I recommend
just using the main armor class and

196
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
just using the main armor class and
 

197
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,830
just using the main armor class and
saving through bonuses for all parts,

198
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
saving through bonuses for all parts,
 

199
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,710
saving through bonuses for all parts,
that can work, too.

200
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
that can work, too.
 

201
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,550
that can work, too.
Players need to declare which part

202
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
Players need to declare which part
 

203
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,790
Players need to declare which part
they're targeting. If they just say, "I

204
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
they're targeting. If they just say, "I
 

205

207
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,670
attack the dragon," assume that they're
attacking the main body, or ask them for

208
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
attacking the main body, or ask them for
 

209
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,110
attacking the main body, or ask them for
more clarification. Using this system,

210
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
more clarification. Using this system,
 

211
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,110
more clarification. Using this system,
all monster parts are treated as

212
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
all monster parts are treated as
 

213
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,670
all monster parts are treated as
occupying all the same squares as the

214
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
occupying all the same squares as the
 

215
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,230
occupying all the same squares as the
monster. For example, you wouldn't take

216
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
monster. For example, you wouldn't take
 

217
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,070
monster. For example, you wouldn't take
the 3x3 token of a huge sized monster

218
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
the 3x3 token of a huge sized monster
 

219
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,629
the 3x3 token of a huge sized monster
and dictate that this square is the

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
and dictate that this square is the
 

221
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,189
and dictate that this square is the
right claw part and this square is the

222
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
right claw part and this square is the
 

223
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,070
right claw part and this square is the
left claw part. Since there are no

224
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
left claw part. Since there are no
 

225
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,550
left claw part. Since there are no
facing rules in Pathfinder and there are

226
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
facing rules in Pathfinder and there are
 

227
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,790
facing rules in Pathfinder and there are
existing precedents, for example, a

228
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
existing precedents, for example, a
 

229
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,870
existing precedents, for example, a
rider occupying all the same spaces as

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
rider occupying all the same spaces as
 

231
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,670
rider occupying all the same spaces as
their mount or the leader occupying all

their mount or the leader occupying all
the same spaces as their troop. In this

234
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
the same spaces as their troop. In this
 

235
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,430
the same spaces as their troop. In this
system, each monster part occupies all

236
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
system, each monster part occupies all
 

237
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,990
system, each monster part occupies all
the same spaces as the monster usually

from the main body, they're all part of
 

247
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,590
from the main body, they're all part of
the same creature. Meaning the creature

248
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
the same creature. Meaning the creature
 

249
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,590

as a whole can only be targeted once per
effect. Let's take a look at chain

252
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
effect. Let's take a look at chain
 

253
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,029
effect. Let's take a look at chain
lightning as an example. Here it says

254
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
lightning as an example. Here it says
 

255
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,830
lightning as an example. Here it says
targets one creature plus any number of

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
targets one creature plus any number of
 

257
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,710
targets one creature plus any number of
additional creatures and the electricity

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
additional creatures and the electricity
 

259
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,350
additional creatures and the electricity
then arcs to another creature within 30

260
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
then arcs to another creature within 30
 

261
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,909
then arcs to another creature within 30
ft of the first target. Jumps to another

262
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
ft of the first target. Jumps to another
 

263
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,909

creature within 30 ft of the target and
 

265
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,390
creature within 30 ft of the target and
so on. You can end the chain at any

266
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
so on. You can end the chain at any
 

267
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,710
so on. You can end the chain at any
point. You can't target the same

268
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
point. You can't target the same
 

269
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,830
point. You can't target the same
creature more than once. Since monster

270
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
creature more than once. Since monster
 

271
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,550
creature more than once. Since monster
parts are all the same singular

272
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
parts are all the same singular

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
lightning to arc from a dragon's head to
 

277
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,230
lightning to arc from a dragon's head to
its wings to its tail to each of its

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
its wings to its tail to each of its
 

279
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,870
its wings to its tail to each of its
claws and so on. You would choose either

280
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
claws and so on. You would choose either
 

281
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,749
claws and so on. You would choose either
one part of the dragon or its main body

282
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
one part of the dragon or its main body
 

283
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,070
one part of the dragon or its main body
to be targeted by chain lightning before

284
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
to be targeted by chain lightning before
 

285
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,950
to be targeted by chain lightning before
it arcs off to the next creature. So

286
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
it arcs off to the next creature. So
 

287
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,029
it arcs off to the next creature. So
bottom line, any effect may only target

thumb is if you're not sure if an effect
 

313

thumb is if you're not sure if an effect
could target a specific part, then apply

00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
could target a specific part, then apply

location's resistances and weaknesses
 

329
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,710
location's resistances and weaknesses
applied separately. Why? Well, because

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,029
it ensures players always feel like
they're making progress towards ending

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
they're making progress towards ending
 

335
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,430
they're making progress towards ending
the fight, which is usually accomplished

336
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
the fight, which is usually accomplished
 

337
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,830
the fight, which is usually accomplished
by depleting the main body's hit points

338
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
by depleting the main body's hit points
 

339
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,230
by depleting the main body's hit points
while they're also working towards the

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
while they're also working towards the
 

341
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,110
while they're also working towards the
tactical goal of disabling a part. It

342
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
tactical goal of disabling a part. It
 

343
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,550
tactical goal of disabling a part. It
represents overall trauma. A big hit to

344
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
represents overall trauma. A big hit to
 

345
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,990
represents overall trauma. A big hit to
a limb hurts the whole creature. Also,

346
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
a limb hurts the whole creature. Also,
 

347
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,870
a limb hurts the whole creature. Also,
difficulty might spiral out of control

348
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
difficulty might spiral out of control
 

349
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,070
difficulty might spiral out of control
if each part is treated as an additional

350
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
if each part is treated as an additional
 

351
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,390
if each part is treated as an additional
layer of hit points on top of the

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
layer of hit points on top of the
 

353
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,589
layer of hit points on top of the
already existing main body hit points.

354
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
already existing main body hit points.
 

355
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,230
already existing main body hit points.
Let's look at an example.

356
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
Let's look at an example.
 

357
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,189
Let's look at an example.
Consider this clock or behemoth. Its

358
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
Consider this clock or behemoth. Its
 

359
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,150
Consider this clock or behemoth. Its
main body has 150 hit points and

360
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
main body has 150 hit points and
 

361
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,110
main body has 150 hit points and
resistance 10 to physical. It has an

362
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
resistance 10 to physical. It has an
 

363
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,710
resistance 10 to physical. It has an
arcane gym part with 30 hit points and

364
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
arcane gym part with 30 hit points and
 

365
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,270
arcane gym part with 30 hit points and
only resistance five to physical. A

366
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
only resistance five to physical. A
 

367
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,070
only resistance five to physical. A
player targets the gym with a Warhammer

368
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
player targets the gym with a Warhammer
 

369
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,670
player targets the gym with a Warhammer
and deals 14 bludgeoning damage. The gym

370
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
and deals 14 bludgeoning damage. The gym
 

371
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,430
and deals 14 bludgeoning damage. The gym
suffers nine damage, 14 raw damage minus

372
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
suffers nine damage, 14 raw damage minus
 

373
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,150
suffers nine damage, 14 raw damage minus
its resistance of five. Therefore, its

374
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
its resistance of five. Therefore, its
 

375
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,990
its resistance of five. Therefore, its
hit points drop to 21. At the same time,

376
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
hit points drop to 21. At the same time,
 

377
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,510
hit points drop to 21. At the same time,
the main body suffers four damage. the

378
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
the main body suffers four damage. the
 

379
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,550
the main body suffers four damage. the

minus the main body's resistance of 10.

382
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
minus the main body's resistance of 10.
 

383
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,190
minus the main body's resistance of 10.
So, its hit points drop to 146.

384
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
So, its hit points drop to 146.
 

385
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,750
So, its hit points drop to 146.
In this system, we have progress on both

386
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
In this system, we have progress on both
 

387
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,150
In this system, we have progress on both
fronts, lowering the main body hit

388
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
fronts, lowering the main body hit
 

389
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,949
fronts, lowering the main body hit
points while also lowering the parts hit

390
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
points while also lowering the parts hit
 

391
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,230
points while also lowering the parts hit
points. And each location has its own

392
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
points. And each location has its own
 

393
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,350
points. And each location has its own
resistances and weaknesses. Now, let's

394
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
resistances and weaknesses. Now, let's
 

395
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,750
resistances and weaknesses. Now, let's
make it a little more interesting. Let's

396
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
make it a little more interesting. Let's
 

397
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,790
make it a little more interesting. Let's
say the behemoth's main body is weak

398
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
say the behemoth's main body is weak
 

399
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,990
say the behemoth's main body is weak
five to electricity, but its arcane gym

400
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
five to electricity, but its arcane gym
 

401
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,630
five to electricity, but its arcane gym
is insulated and has resistance

402
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
is insulated and has resistance
 

403
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,990
is insulated and has resistance
electricity 10. A player targets the gem

404
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
electricity 10. A player targets the gem
 

405
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,949
electricity 10. A player targets the gem
with electric arc and deals 15

406
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
with electric arc and deals 15
 

407
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,070
with electric arc and deals 15
electricity damage. The gym suffers five

408
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
electricity damage. The gym suffers five
 

409
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,350
electricity damage. The gym suffers five
damage, 15 damage minus its resistance

410
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
damage, 15 damage minus its resistance
 

411
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,910
damage, 15 damage minus its resistance
10 to electricity, so its hit points

412
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
10 to electricity, so its hit points
 

413
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,389
10 to electricity, so its hit points
drop to 16. And the main body suffers 20

414
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
drop to 16. And the main body suffers 20
 

415
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,150
drop to 16. And the main body suffers 20
damage, 15 plus its weakness five to

416
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
damage, 15 plus its weakness five to
 

417
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,190
damage, 15 plus its weakness five to
electricity. So its hit points drop to

418
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
electricity. So its hit points drop to
 

419
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,710
electricity. So its hit points drop to
126. Again, all the damage is applied

420
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
126. Again, all the damage is applied
 

421
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,910
126. Again, all the damage is applied
separately to the targeted part and the

422
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
separately to the targeted part and the
 

423
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,389
separately to the targeted part and the
monster's main body. This may seem

424
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
monster's main body. This may seem
 

425
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,150
monster's main body. This may seem
complicated, but remember, in most

426
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
complicated, but remember, in most
 

427
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,150
complicated, but remember, in most
cases, the different parts will likely

428
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
cases, the different parts will likely
 

429
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,310
cases, the different parts will likely
have the same resistances and weaknesses

430
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
have the same resistances and weaknesses
 

431
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,949
have the same resistances and weaknesses
as the main body. But this rule also

432
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
as the main body. But this rule also
 

433
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,430
as the main body. But this rule also
allows creatures like a fiveheaded

434
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
allows creatures like a fiveheaded
 

435
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,430
allows creatures like a fiveheaded
chromatic dragon to have different

436
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
chromatic dragon to have different
 

437
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,829
chromatic dragon to have different
weaknesses and resistances for each of

438
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
weaknesses and resistances for each of
 

439
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,190
weaknesses and resistances for each of
its heads.

440
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200

 

441
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,990

So what happens when a part's hit points

442
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
So what happens when a part's hit points
 

443
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,790
So what happens when a part's hit points
reach zero? Well, it becomes broken just

444
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
reach zero? Well, it becomes broken just
 

445
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,150
reach zero? Well, it becomes broken just
like any other object in Pathfinder. A

446
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
like any other object in Pathfinder. A
 

447
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,670
like any other object in Pathfinder. A
broken part loses its functionality. The

448
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
broken part loses its functionality. The
 

449
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,990
broken part loses its functionality. The
creature can't use any actions,

450
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
creature can't use any actions,
 

451
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,990
creature can't use any actions,
reactions, or abilities tied

452
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
reactions, or abilities tied
 

453
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,190
reactions, or abilities tied
specifically to that part. Optionally, a

454
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
specifically to that part. Optionally, a
 

455
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,829
specifically to that part. Optionally, a
broken part could also impose penalties,

456
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
broken part could also impose penalties,
 

457
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,949
broken part could also impose penalties,
like a broken leg, reducing speed. And

458
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
like a broken leg, reducing speed. And
 

459
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,710
like a broken leg, reducing speed. And
we should also take a moment to discuss

460
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
we should also take a moment to discuss
 

461
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,269
we should also take a moment to discuss
healing. Healing effects that typically

462
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
healing. Healing effects that typically
 

463
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,670
healing. Healing effects that typically
have targets can be used to heal either

464
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
have targets can be used to heal either
 

465
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,910
have targets can be used to heal either
the creature's main body or a single

466
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
the creature's main body or a single
 

467
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,030
the creature's main body or a single
part. And just like how damaging a part

468
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
part. And just like how damaging a part
 

469
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,590
part. And just like how damaging a part
applies the damage to both that part and

470
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
applies the damage to both that part and
 

471
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,990
applies the damage to both that part and
the main body, applying healing to a

472
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
the main body, applying healing to a
 

473
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,550
the main body, applying healing to a
part also heals the main body the same

474
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
part also heals the main body the same
 

475
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,790
part also heals the main body the same
amount. For example, the heal spell

476
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
amount. For example, the heal spell
 

477
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,190
amount. For example, the heal spell
targets one living creature. This could

478
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
targets one living creature. This could
 

479
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,190
targets one living creature. This could
be used to heal either the creature's

480
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
be used to heal either the creature's
 

481
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,670
be used to heal either the creature's
main body or a single part. And if it

482
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
main body or a single part. And if it
 

483
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,829
main body or a single part. And if it
targets a part, then the healing is

484
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
targets a part, then the healing is
 

485
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,069
targets a part, then the healing is
applied to both that part and to the

486
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
applied to both that part and to the
 

487
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,350
applied to both that part and to the
main body. Yes. A downside of this is

488
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
main body. Yes. A downside of this is
 

489
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,150
main body. Yes. A downside of this is
there's no benefit to targeting just the

490
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
there's no benefit to targeting just the
 

491
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,030
there's no benefit to targeting just the
main body, but this rule is simple and

492
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
main body, but this rule is simple and
 

493
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,750
main body, but this rule is simple and
consistent with how damaging a multi-art

494
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
consistent with how damaging a multi-art
 

495
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,870
consistent with how damaging a multi-art
opponent works. And area healing effects

496
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
opponent works. And area healing effects
 

497
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,790
opponent works. And area healing effects
like the three action version of the

498
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
like the three action version of the
 

499
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,269
like the three action version of the
heal spell only restore the creature's

500
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
heal spell only restore the creature's
 

501
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,829
heal spell only restore the creature's
main body. For other effects like fast

502
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
main body. For other effects like fast
 

503
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,230
main body. For other effects like fast
healing, these likely apply to all the

504
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
healing, these likely apply to all the
 

505
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,870
healing, these likely apply to all the
creatures parts and their main body

506
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
creatures parts and their main body
 

507
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,350
creatures parts and their main body
once. You wouldn't multiply the fast

508
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
once. You wouldn't multiply the fast
 

509
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,150
once. You wouldn't multiply the fast
healing per part and then apply that

510
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
healing per part and then apply that
 

511
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,590
healing per part and then apply that
total to the main body. But keep in mind

512
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
total to the main body. But keep in mind
 

513
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,150
total to the main body. But keep in mind
that under normal circumstances, a

514
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
that under normal circumstances, a
 

515
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,190
that under normal circumstances, a
broken part may not be made functional

516
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
broken part may not be made functional
 

517
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,670
broken part may not be made functional
again through normal healing. Once a

518
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
again through normal healing. Once a
 

519
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,990
again through normal healing. Once a
part's hit points are reduced to zero,

520
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
part's hit points are reduced to zero,
 

521
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,269
part's hit points are reduced to zero,
it becomes broken and it remains broken

522
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
it becomes broken and it remains broken
 

523
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,150
it becomes broken and it remains broken
for the remainder of the encounter. The

524
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
for the remainder of the encounter. The
 

525
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,870
for the remainder of the encounter. The
reason for this is twofold. First,

526
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
reason for this is twofold. First,
 

527
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,110
reason for this is twofold. First,
breaking apart should feel like a

528
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
breaking apart should feel like a
 

529
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,509
breaking apart should feel like a
significant moment in the narrative, and

530
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
significant moment in the narrative, and
 

531
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,190
significant moment in the narrative, and
players may feel cheated if that

532
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
players may feel cheated if that
 

533
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,949
players may feel cheated if that
accomplishment is taken away from them

534
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
accomplishment is taken away from them
 

535
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,750
accomplishment is taken away from them
by healing. And second, allowing a

536
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
by healing. And second, allowing a
 

537
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,150
by healing. And second, allowing a
broken part to be restored may

538
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
broken part to be restored may
 

539
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,150
broken part to be restored may
significantly increase the challenge of

540
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
significantly increase the challenge of
 

541
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,269
significantly increase the challenge of
the encounter. So, if a dragon's claw is

542
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
the encounter. So, if a dragon's claw is
 

543
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,670
the encounter. So, if a dragon's claw is
broken and the dragon's main body

544
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
broken and the dragon's main body
 

545
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,910
broken and the dragon's main body
receives healing, it may become

546
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
receives healing, it may become
 

547
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,590
receives healing, it may become
healthier overall, but its claw is still

548
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
healthier overall, but its claw is still
 

549
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,790
healthier overall, but its claw is still
crippled. Outside of combat, the GM can

550
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
crippled. Outside of combat, the GM can
 

551
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,710
crippled. Outside of combat, the GM can
decide how long it takes for this boss

552
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
decide how long it takes for this boss
 

553
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,949
decide how long it takes for this boss
monster to heal up and recover the use

554
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
monster to heal up and recover the use
 

555
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,150
monster to heal up and recover the use
of its broken parts.

556
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
of its broken parts.
 

557
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,550
of its broken parts.
Multi-art creatures still get their

558
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
Multi-art creatures still get their
 

559
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,190
Multi-art creatures still get their
usual three actions in one reaction per

560
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
usual three actions in one reaction per
 

561
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,069
usual three actions in one reaction per
turn. It just can't use actions that are

562
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
turn. It just can't use actions that are
 

563
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,710
turn. It just can't use actions that are
tied to broken parts. If it has two

564
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
tied to broken parts. If it has two
 

565
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,790
tied to broken parts. If it has two
claws and one is broken, it can still

566
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
claws and one is broken, it can still
 

567
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,350
claws and one is broken, it can still
attack with the other. Also apply

568
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
attack with the other. Also apply
 

569
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,670
attack with the other. Also apply
conditions like frightened, stunned, or

570
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
conditions like frightened, stunned, or
 

571
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,150
conditions like frightened, stunned, or
grabbed to the main creature as these

572
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
grabbed to the main creature as these
 

573
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,190
grabbed to the main creature as these
affect the creature as a whole. However,

574
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
affect the creature as a whole. However,
 

575
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,670
affect the creature as a whole. However,
you may want to allow part specific

576
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
you may want to allow part specific
 

577
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,990
you may want to allow part specific
conditions for dramatic effect and the

578
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
conditions for dramatic effect and the
 

579
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,629
conditions for dramatic effect and the
rule of cool. For example, you might

580
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
rule of cool. For example, you might
 

581
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,870
rule of cool. For example, you might
allow a barbarian to grab a dragon's

582
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
allow a barbarian to grab a dragon's
 

583
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,790
allow a barbarian to grab a dragon's
tail to prevent it from making tail

584
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
tail to prevent it from making tail
 

585
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,190
tail to prevent it from making tail
strikes or holding its mouth shut to

586
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
strikes or holding its mouth shut to
 

587
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,269
strikes or holding its mouth shut to
prevent it from using its breath weapon.

588
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
prevent it from using its breath weapon.
 

589
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,310
prevent it from using its breath weapon.
As usual, cases like these are entirely

590
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
As usual, cases like these are entirely
 

591
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,629
As usual, cases like these are entirely
left up to the GM to decide if they'll

592
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
left up to the GM to decide if they'll
 

593
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,030
left up to the GM to decide if they'll
allow them.

594
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
allow them.
 

595
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,750
allow them.
Okay, breaking parts is cool, but we can

596
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
Okay, breaking parts is cool, but we can
 

597
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,389
Okay, breaking parts is cool, but we can
make it even more dynamic with phases

598
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
make it even more dynamic with phases
 

599
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,030
make it even more dynamic with phases
and triggers, which are also inspired by

600
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
and triggers, which are also inspired by
 

601
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,069
and triggers, which are also inspired by
how Fabula Ultima handles some of their

602
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
how Fabula Ultima handles some of their
 

603
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,910
how Fabula Ultima handles some of their
multi-part bosses. A phase is just one

604
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
multi-part bosses. A phase is just one
 

605
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,870
multi-part bosses. A phase is just one
distinct stage of a fight. The boss

606
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
distinct stage of a fight. The boss
 

607
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,110
distinct stage of a fight. The boss
might change tactics, use new abilities,

608
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
might change tactics, use new abilities,
 

609
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,509
might change tactics, use new abilities,
or the environment around them might

610
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
or the environment around them might
 

611
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,470
or the environment around them might
shift. And a trigger is what causes the

612
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
shift. And a trigger is what causes the
 

613
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,269
shift. And a trigger is what causes the
shift into a new phase. Breaking a

614
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
shift into a new phase. Breaking a
 

615
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,910
shift into a new phase. Breaking a
specific part could be a perfect trigger

616
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
specific part could be a perfect trigger
 

617
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,990
specific part could be a perfect trigger
for these. Other triggers could be

618
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
for these. Other triggers could be
 

619
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,829
for these. Other triggers could be
hitting hit point thresholds, like

620
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
hitting hit point thresholds, like
 

621
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,310
hitting hit point thresholds, like
becoming bloodied at 50% of the main

622
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
becoming bloodied at 50% of the main
 

623
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,629
becoming bloodied at 50% of the main
body's hit points. Triggers could also

624
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
body's hit points. Triggers could also
 

625
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,310
body's hit points. Triggers could also
be players interacting with the

626
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
be players interacting with the
 

627
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,870
be players interacting with the
environment in a certain way or even

628
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
environment in a certain way or even
 

629
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,870
environment in a certain way or even
just after a certain number of rounds

630
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
just after a certain number of rounds
 

631
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,870
just after a certain number of rounds
have passed. But since this video is

632
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
have passed. But since this video is
 

633
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,269
have passed. But since this video is
about multi-part opponents, we're going

634
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
about multi-part opponents, we're going
 

635
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,910
about multi-part opponents, we're going
to focus on phase triggers being caused

636
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
to focus on phase triggers being caused
 

637
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,790
to focus on phase triggers being caused
by damage. So, let's go back to our

638
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
by damage. So, let's go back to our
 

639
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,509
by damage. So, let's go back to our
clockwork behemoth. We have a phase

640
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
clockwork behemoth. We have a phase
 

641
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,310
clockwork behemoth. We have a phase
trigger that says the arcane gem part

642
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
trigger that says the arcane gem part
 

643
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,790
trigger that says the arcane gem part
becomes broken. And when that is

644
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
becomes broken. And when that is
 

645
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,910
becomes broken. And when that is
triggered, a new phase starts. Phases

646
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
triggered, a new phase starts. Phases
 

647
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,189
triggered, a new phase starts. Phases
are all about change. So, what changes

648
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
are all about change. So, what changes
 

649
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,590
are all about change. So, what changes
when the behemoth's arcane gym is

650
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
when the behemoth's arcane gym is
 

651
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,829
when the behemoth's arcane gym is
shattered? Well, first the behemoth

652
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
shattered? Well, first the behemoth
 

653
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,189
shattered? Well, first the behemoth
loses its gem powered energy blast. It

654
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
loses its gem powered energy blast. It
 

655
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,629
loses its gem powered energy blast. It
gains a steam vent attack that deals

656
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
gains a steam vent attack that deals
 

657
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,670
gains a steam vent attack that deals
fire damage in a cone area. His tactics

658
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
fire damage in a cone area. His tactics
 

659
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,670
fire damage in a cone area. His tactics
changed to become a very aggressive

660
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
changed to become a very aggressive
 

661
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,069
changed to become a very aggressive
melee fighter and also it starts

662
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
melee fighter and also it starts
 

663
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,710
melee fighter and also it starts
grappling its enemies and his stats

664
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
grappling its enemies and his stats
 

665
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,949
grappling its enemies and his stats
change. The weakness to electricity is

666
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
change. The weakness to electricity is
 

667
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,430
change. The weakness to electricity is
gone. But now it has gained a weakness

668
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
gone. But now it has gained a weakness
 

669
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,110
gone. But now it has gained a weakness
to cold damage. So why do we use phases?

670
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
to cold damage. So why do we use phases?
 

671
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,829
to cold damage. So why do we use phases?
phases make boss fights feel like a

672
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
phases make boss fights feel like a
 

673
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,990
phases make boss fights feel like a
journey. They reward players for

674
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
journey. They reward players for
 

675
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,910
journey. They reward players for
achieving tactical goals like breaking

676
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
achieving tactical goals like breaking
 

677
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,230
achieving tactical goals like breaking
apart. They keep the fight from getting

678
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
apart. They keep the fight from getting
 

679
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,269
apart. They keep the fight from getting
stale. They ramp up the tension and they

680
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
stale. They ramp up the tension and they
 

681
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,430
stale. They ramp up the tension and they
allow for cool narrative moments.

682
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
allow for cool narrative moments.
 

683
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,670
allow for cool narrative moments.
So, we've established that attacking

684
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
So, we've established that attacking
 

685
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,470
So, we've established that attacking
parts let you do something cool and

686
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
parts let you do something cool and
 

687
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,110
parts let you do something cool and
powerful. You can disable specific

688
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
powerful. You can disable specific
 

689
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,150
powerful. You can disable specific
monster abilities. Normally, you can't

690
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
monster abilities. Normally, you can't
 

691
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,230
monster abilities. Normally, you can't
prevent a dragon from using his breath

692
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
prevent a dragon from using his breath
 

693
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,870
prevent a dragon from using his breath
weapon. But with this system, targeting

694
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
weapon. But with this system, targeting
 

695
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,150
weapon. But with this system, targeting
and breaking his head can achieve that.

696
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
and breaking his head can achieve that.
 

697
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,550
and breaking his head can achieve that.
But here's the crucial part of design

698
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
But here's the crucial part of design
 

699
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,870
But here's the crucial part of design
philosophy to make this work and keep

700
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
philosophy to make this work and keep
 

701
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,269
philosophy to make this work and keep
encounters challenging. It shouldn't

702
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
encounters challenging. It shouldn't
 

703
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,550
encounters challenging. It shouldn't
ever be a free lunch. And by that I mean

704
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
ever be a free lunch. And by that I mean
 

705
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,750
ever be a free lunch. And by that I mean
if attacking a part always gives you a

706
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:47,760
if attacking a part always gives you a
 

707
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,069
if attacking a part always gives you a
massive advantage in that it can disable

708
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
massive advantage in that it can disable
 

709
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,870
massive advantage in that it can disable
an ability and at the same time also

710
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
an ability and at the same time also
 

711
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,430
an ability and at the same time also
damages the main body just like a normal

712
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
damages the main body just like a normal
 

713
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,910
damages the main body just like a normal
hit. Then there's really no downside

714
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
hit. Then there's really no downside
 

715
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,269
hit. Then there's really no downside
here. The players will always attack the

716
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
here. The players will always attack the
 

717
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,389
here. The players will always attack the
parts and therefore that removes any

718
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
parts and therefore that removes any
 

719
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,749
parts and therefore that removes any
real tactical choice. So to maintain

720
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
real tactical choice. So to maintain
 

721
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,310
real tactical choice. So to maintain
balance and create interesting decisions

722
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
balance and create interesting decisions
 

723
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,870
balance and create interesting decisions
there needs to be a trade-off. The

724
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
there needs to be a trade-off. The
 

725
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,110
there needs to be a trade-off. The
significant benefit of disabling a

726
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
significant benefit of disabling a
 

727
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,350
significant benefit of disabling a
powerful monster ability should come

728
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
powerful monster ability should come
 

729
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,189
powerful monster ability should come
with a roughly equivalent cost, risk, or

730
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
with a roughly equivalent cost, risk, or
 

731
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,749
with a roughly equivalent cost, risk, or
consequence. Think of it like this. The

732
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
consequence. Think of it like this. The
 

733
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,269
consequence. Think of it like this. The
game is letting you do something

734
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
game is letting you do something
 

735
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,590
game is letting you do something
extraordinary like removing a breath

736
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
extraordinary like removing a breath
 

737
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,910
extraordinary like removing a breath
weapon. So, there should also be an

738
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
weapon. So, there should also be an
 

739
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,710
weapon. So, there should also be an
extraordinary consequence or challenge

740
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
extraordinary consequence or challenge
 

741
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,230
extraordinary consequence or challenge
involved.

742
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
involved.
 

743
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,749
involved.
This cost can come in two main forms.

744
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
This cost can come in two main forms.
 

745
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,110
This cost can come in two main forms.
First are frontend costs. These make

746
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
First are frontend costs. These make
 

747
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,069
First are frontend costs. These make
attacking the part itself harder or

748
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
attacking the part itself harder or
 

749
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,030
attacking the part itself harder or
riskier than attacking the main body.

750
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
riskier than attacking the main body.
 

751
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,870
riskier than attacking the main body.
For example, this could come in the form

752
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
For example, this could come in the form
 

753
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,269
For example, this could come in the form
of higher defenses. The part might have

754
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
of higher defenses. The part might have
 

755
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,910
of higher defenses. The part might have
a higher armor class and reflex bonus,

756
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
a higher armor class and reflex bonus,
 

757
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,790
a higher armor class and reflex bonus,
making it harder to hit accurately.

758
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
making it harder to hit accurately.
 

759
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,189
making it harder to hit accurately.
Maybe its head is smaller and moving

760
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
Maybe its head is smaller and moving
 

761
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,790
Maybe its head is smaller and moving
around in such a way that it becomes

762
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
around in such a way that it becomes
 

763
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,790
around in such a way that it becomes
harder to hit. This could come in the

764
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
harder to hit. This could come in the
 

765
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,429
harder to hit. This could come in the
form of resistances. the part could have

766
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
form of resistances. the part could have
 

767
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,470
form of resistances. the part could have
a resistance that the main body doesn't,

768
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
a resistance that the main body doesn't,
 

769
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,189
a resistance that the main body doesn't,
especially resistance physical, meaning

770
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
especially resistance physical, meaning
 

771
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,909
especially resistance physical, meaning
most of your hits have to overcome that

772
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
most of your hits have to overcome that
 

773
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,549
most of your hits have to overcome that
threshold first before they apply any

774
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
threshold first before they apply any
 

775
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,949
threshold first before they apply any
damage. For example, the dragon's head

776
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
damage. For example, the dragon's head
 

777
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,189
damage. For example, the dragon's head
could have larger scales that are angled

778
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
could have larger scales that are angled
 

779
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,390
could have larger scales that are angled
to deflect away physical attacks. And

780
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
to deflect away physical attacks. And
 

781
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,230
to deflect away physical attacks. And
another form of frontend cost could be

782
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
another form of frontend cost could be
 

783
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,669
another form of frontend cost could be
triggered reactions. Attacking the part

784
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
triggered reactions. Attacking the part
 

785
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,830
triggered reactions. Attacking the part
might provoke an immediate defensive

786
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
might provoke an immediate defensive
 

787
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,789
might provoke an immediate defensive
reaction. For example, striking a giant

788
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
reaction. For example, striking a giant
 

789
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,190
reaction. For example, striking a giant
scorpion's tail only for it to instantly

790
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
scorpion's tail only for it to instantly
 

791
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,909
scorpion's tail only for it to instantly
lash back at you with his stinger as a

792
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
lash back at you with his stinger as a
 

793
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,070
lash back at you with his stinger as a
reaction. Those are all frontend costs

794
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
reaction. Those are all frontend costs
 

795
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,310
reaction. Those are all frontend costs
that make attacking the part more

796
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
that make attacking the part more
 

797
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,710
that make attacking the part more
difficult or pose a narratively

798
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
difficult or pose a narratively
 

799
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,110
difficult or pose a narratively
interesting consequence for doing so.

800
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
interesting consequence for doing so.
 

801
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,270
interesting consequence for doing so.
Therefore, logically, the second type of

802
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
Therefore, logically, the second type of
 

803
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,870
Therefore, logically, the second type of
costs are backend costs. These are

804
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
costs are backend costs. These are
 

805
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,750
costs are backend costs. These are
consequences that happen after you

806
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
consequences that happen after you
 

807
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,549
consequences that happen after you
successfully break the part. First up

808
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
successfully break the part. First up
 

809
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,270
successfully break the part. First up
are dangerous phase triggers, and this

810
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
are dangerous phase triggers, and this
 

811
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,830
are dangerous phase triggers, and this
is a big one. Successfully breaking a

812
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
is a big one. Successfully breaking a
 

813
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,029
is a big one. Successfully breaking a
key part might push the monster into an

814
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
key part might push the monster into an
 

815
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,310
key part might push the monster into an
even more dangerous phase. You stopped

816
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
even more dangerous phase. You stopped
 

817
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,430
even more dangerous phase. You stopped
the breath weapon, but now the dragon is

818
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,440
the breath weapon, but now the dragon is
 

819
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,150
the breath weapon, but now the dragon is
enraged, so it's hitting faster with its

820
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
enraged, so it's hitting faster with its
 

821
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,110
enraged, so it's hitting faster with its
tail and claws. The second kind of

822
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
tail and claws. The second kind of
 

823
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,470
tail and claws. The second kind of
backend cost are negative effects.

824
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
backend cost are negative effects.
 

825
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,789
backend cost are negative effects.
Breaking apart could have a direct

826
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
Breaking apart could have a direct
 

827
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,750
Breaking apart could have a direct
negative consequence. Maybe shattering a

828
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
negative consequence. Maybe shattering a
 

829
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,470
negative consequence. Maybe shattering a
construct's power core causes an energy

830
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
construct's power core causes an energy
 

831
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,669
construct's power core causes an energy
explosion, damaging everyone nearby, or

832
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
explosion, damaging everyone nearby, or
 

833
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,230
explosion, damaging everyone nearby, or
breaking a spawning sack on a monster

834
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
breaking a spawning sack on a monster
 

835
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,270
breaking a spawning sack on a monster
releases a swarm of weaker minions into

836
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
releases a swarm of weaker minions into
 

837
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,150
releases a swarm of weaker minions into
the fight. And the last kind of backend

838
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
the fight. And the last kind of backend
 

839
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,350
the fight. And the last kind of backend
cost could be a shift in resistances and

840
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
cost could be a shift in resistances and
 

841
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,070
cost could be a shift in resistances and
weaknesses. Breaking apart might remove

842
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
weaknesses. Breaking apart might remove
 

843
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,630
weaknesses. Breaking apart might remove
one resistance but expose or create

844
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
one resistance but expose or create
 

845
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,590
one resistance but expose or create
another, thereby forcing the party to

846
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
another, thereby forcing the party to
 

847
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,110
another, thereby forcing the party to
have to adapt their tactics.

848
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
have to adapt their tactics.
 

849
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,110
have to adapt their tactics.
So, let's take one more look at our

850
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
So, let's take one more look at our
 

851
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,990
So, let's take one more look at our
example of a clockwork behemoth. The

852
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
example of a clockwork behemoth. The
 

853
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,390
example of a clockwork behemoth. The
benefit of breaking its arcane gem is

854
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
benefit of breaking its arcane gem is
 

855
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,950
benefit of breaking its arcane gem is
you disable its main energy blast, but

856
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
you disable its main energy blast, but
 

857
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,350
you disable its main energy blast, but
there needs to be a cost for this,

858
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
there needs to be a cost for this,
 

859
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,990
there needs to be a cost for this,
either on the front end or on the back

860
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
either on the front end or on the back
 

861
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,270
either on the front end or on the back
end. A potential front-end cost may be

862
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
end. A potential front-end cost may be
 

863
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,669
end. A potential front-end cost may be
giving the gem a bonus to armor class

864
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
giving the gem a bonus to armor class
 

865
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,110
giving the gem a bonus to armor class
and reflex saves as a smaller target.

866
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
and reflex saves as a smaller target.
 

867
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,590
and reflex saves as a smaller target.
So, his armor class and reflex bonus are

868
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
So, his armor class and reflex bonus are
 

869
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,549
So, his armor class and reflex bonus are
increased by two, three, or four points.

870
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
increased by two, three, or four points.
 

871
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,110
increased by two, three, or four points.
Or it could have a higher resistance

872
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
Or it could have a higher resistance
 

873
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,510
Or it could have a higher resistance
than the main body, meaning attacks

874
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
than the main body, meaning attacks
 

875
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,750
than the main body, meaning attacks
targeting it need to overcome a minimal

876
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
targeting it need to overcome a minimal
 

877
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,350
targeting it need to overcome a minimal
amount before they can start chipping

878
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
amount before they can start chipping
 

879
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,510
amount before they can start chipping
away at its hit points. Or another

880
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
away at its hit points. Or another
 

881
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,830
away at its hit points. Or another
possible front-end cost could be hitting

882
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
possible front-end cost could be hitting
 

883
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,549
possible front-end cost could be hitting
it causes a bright flash of light that

884
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
it causes a bright flash of light that
 

885
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,590
it causes a bright flash of light that
could dazzle the attacker. So those are

886
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
could dazzle the attacker. So those are
 

887
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,390
could dazzle the attacker. So those are
possible frontend costs, things that

888
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
possible frontend costs, things that
 

889
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,190
possible frontend costs, things that
make it less desirable to attack the

890
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
make it less desirable to attack the
 

891
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,070
make it less desirable to attack the
part in the first place. You could also

892
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
part in the first place. You could also
 

893
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,190
part in the first place. You could also
use a backend cost. For example, its

894
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
use a backend cost. For example, its
 

895
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,510
use a backend cost. For example, its
armor class and reflex bonus are the

896
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
armor class and reflex bonus are the
 

897
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,070
armor class and reflex bonus are the
same as the main body, but when the gem

898
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
same as the main body, but when the gem
 

899
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,029
same as the main body, but when the gem
breaks, it could explode, dealing fire

900
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
breaks, it could explode, dealing fire
 

901
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,590
breaks, it could explode, dealing fire
damage to everything within 5 ft and

902
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
damage to everything within 5 ft and
 

903
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,870
damage to everything within 5 ft and
also trigger a phase change or advance

904
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
also trigger a phase change or advance
 

905
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,750
also trigger a phase change or advance
steam and becomes a more melee focused

906
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
steam and becomes a more melee focused
 

907
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,310
steam and becomes a more melee focused
enemy. This could force the players into

908
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
enemy. This could force the players into
 

909
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,070
enemy. This could force the players into
narratively interesting and tactically

910
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
narratively interesting and tactically
 

911
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,390
narratively interesting and tactically
minded choices. Do you risk the

912
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
minded choices. Do you risk the
 

913
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,950
minded choices. Do you risk the
immediate explosion and a tougher melee

914
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
immediate explosion and a tougher melee
 

915
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,310
immediate explosion and a tougher melee
fight to stop its ranged energy blast?

916
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
fight to stop its ranged energy blast?
 

917
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,110
fight to stop its ranged energy blast?
Or is it safer to try and burn down its

918
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
Or is it safer to try and burn down its
 

919
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,510
Or is it safer to try and burn down its
main body hit points while dodging the

920
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
main body hit points while dodging the
 

921
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,230
main body hit points while dodging the
blast? Maybe because the gem has such

922
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
blast? Maybe because the gem has such
 

923
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,870
blast? Maybe because the gem has such
high resistances. And keep in mind,

924
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
high resistances. And keep in mind,
 

925
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,310
high resistances. And keep in mind,
regardless of how you design the

926
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
regardless of how you design the
 

927
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,630
regardless of how you design the
monster, the players may not know the

928
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
monster, the players may not know the
 

929
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,870
monster, the players may not know the
consequences of breaking apart unless

930
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
consequences of breaking apart unless
 

931
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,870
consequences of breaking apart unless
they pass a recall knowledge or

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
they pass a recall knowledge or
 

933
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,750
they pass a recall knowledge or
perception check. So find ways encourage

934
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
perception check. So find ways encourage
 

935
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,510
perception check. So find ways encourage
them to do so or don't. Surprises can be

936
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
them to do so or don't. Surprises can be
 

937
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,789
them to do so or don't. Surprises can be
fun, too. The key for GMs is finding

00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
fun, too. The key for GMs is finding
 

939
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,750
fun, too. The key for GMs is finding
that sweet spot. The cost shouldn't be

940
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
that sweet spot. The cost shouldn't be
 

941
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,070
that sweet spot. The cost shouldn't be
so punishing that players never attack

942
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
so punishing that players never attack
 

943
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,870
so punishing that players never attack
the parts, but it should be significant

944
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
the parts, but it should be significant
 

945
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,190
the parts, but it should be significant
enough to make them pause and consider

946
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
enough to make them pause and consider
 

947
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,830
enough to make them pause and consider
if disabling that specific ability right

948
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
if disabling that specific ability right
 

949
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,110
if disabling that specific ability right
now is worth the associated risk or

950
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
now is worth the associated risk or
 

951
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,830
now is worth the associated risk or
consequence. This can turn a typical

952
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
consequence. This can turn a typical
 

953
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,710
consequence. This can turn a typical
boss fight from a simple hit point race

954
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
boss fight from a simple hit point race
 

955
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,510

choices.
Now, with all of this in mind, let's try

960
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
Now, with all of this in mind, let's try
 

961
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,350
Now, with all of this in mind, let's try
converting an existing Pathfinder

962
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
converting an existing Pathfinder
 

963
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,350
converting an existing Pathfinder
monster into an epic multi-part boss.

964
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
monster into an epic multi-part boss.
 

965
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,750
monster into an epic multi-part boss.
For this, we'll be using Menare the

966
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
For this, we'll be using Menare the
 

967
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,310
For this, we'll be using Menare the
Great Worm, which I am adapting for an

968
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
Great Worm, which I am adapting for an
 

969
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,149
Great Worm, which I am adapting for an
upcoming session. So, if you're one of

970
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
upcoming session. So, if you're one of
 

971
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,710
upcoming session. So, if you're one of
my players, stop watching now. For this,

972
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
my players, stop watching now. For this,
 

973
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,190
my players, stop watching now. For this,
I'll be breaking the process down into a

974
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
I'll be breaking the process down into a
 

975
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,470
I'll be breaking the process down into a
series of steps. First, choose the base

976
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
series of steps. First, choose the base
 

977
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,990
series of steps. First, choose the base
creature. Next, identify parts and match

978
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
creature. Next, identify parts and match
 

979
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,270
creature. Next, identify parts and match
abilities. Third, define the parts

980
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
abilities. Third, define the parts
 

981
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,470
abilities. Third, define the parts
mechanically. Fourth, define broken

982
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
mechanically. Fourth, define broken
 

983
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,070
mechanically. Fourth, define broken
effects. Then, consider backend costs,

984
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
effects. Then, consider backend costs,
 

985
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,029
effects. Then, consider backend costs,
which could be phases and triggers. And

986
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
which could be phases and triggers. And
 

987
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,390
which could be phases and triggers. And
last, review, refine, and balance as

988
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
last, review, refine, and balance as
 

989
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,870
last, review, refine, and balance as
best you can. So, starting with step

990
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
best you can. So, starting with step
 

991
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,909
best you can. So, starting with step
one, we choose Manare as the base

992
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
one, we choose Manare as the base
 

993
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,990
one, we choose Manare as the base
creature. He is a level 23 gold dragon.

994
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
creature. He is a level 23 gold dragon.
 

995

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
breath weapon that can be used to either
 

1011
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,390
breath weapon that can be used to either
make a cone of flame or blast a

weakening gas, and can cast arcane
 

1015
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,510
weakening gas, and can cast arcane
innate spells. Step two, identify parts

1016
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
innate spells. Step two, identify parts
 

1017
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,310
innate spells. Step two, identify parts
and match abilities. We break the

1018
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
and match abilities. We break the
 

1019
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,110
and match abilities. We break the
ancient dragon down into head, right

1020
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
ancient dragon down into head, right
 

1021
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,470
ancient dragon down into head, right
claw, left claw, tail, and wings. and

1022
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
claw, left claw, tail, and wings. and
 

1023
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,950
claw, left claw, tail, and wings. and
then assigned each part the abilities

1024
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
then assigned each part the abilities
 

1025
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,830
then assigned each part the abilities
for which it is responsible. We assign

1026
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840
for which it is responsible. We assign
 

1027
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,029
for which it is responsible. We assign
frightful presence, jaws, horns, breath

1028
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
frightful presence, jaws, horns, breath
 

1029
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,230
frightful presence, jaws, horns, breath
weapon, and arcane spells to its head.

1030
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
weapon, and arcane spells to its head.
 

1031
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,029
weapon, and arcane spells to its head.
We assign one claw attack to each of its

1032
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
We assign one claw attack to each of its
 

1033
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,390
We assign one claw attack to each of its
claws. We assign its tail attack to its

1034
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
claws. We assign its tail attack to its
 

1035
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,750
claws. We assign its tail attack to its
tail, and we assign its fly speed to its

1036
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
tail, and we assign its fly speed to its
 

1037
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,630
tail, and we assign its fly speed to its
wings. All other characteristics are

1038
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
wings. All other characteristics are
 

1039
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,909
wings. All other characteristics are
assigned to his main body. Now, this is

1040
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
assigned to his main body. Now, this is
 

1041
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,110
assigned to his main body. Now, this is
a lot to manage. five distinct parts

1042
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
a lot to manage. five distinct parts
 

1043
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,350
a lot to manage. five distinct parts
plus the main body. This is making

1044
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
plus the main body. This is making
 

1045
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,190
plus the main body. This is making
things more cumbersome than is

1046
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
things more cumbersome than is
 

1047
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,470
things more cumbersome than is
necessary. So, let's only use parts for

1048
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
necessary. So, let's only use parts for
 

1049
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,510
necessary. So, let's only use parts for
what's most narratively interesting. The

1050
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
what's most narratively interesting. The
 

1051
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,830
what's most narratively interesting. The
two claws and the tail aren't really

1052
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
two claws and the tail aren't really
 

1053
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,390
two claws and the tail aren't really
bringing anything exciting to the party.

1054
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
bringing anything exciting to the party.
 

1055
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,029
bringing anything exciting to the party.
So, we won't worry about managing those

1056
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
So, we won't worry about managing those
 

1057
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,549
So, we won't worry about managing those
as parts, but the head and wings are

1058
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
as parts, but the head and wings are
 

1059
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,270
as parts, but the head and wings are
more interesting. So, we will manage

1060
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,280
more interesting. So, we will manage
 

1061
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,470
more interesting. So, we will manage
them as parts. We now have three aspects

1062
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
them as parts. We now have three aspects
 

1063
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,990
them as parts. We now have three aspects
of Manari that we need to manage. A head

1064
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
of Manari that we need to manage. A head
 

1065
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,149
of Manari that we need to manage. A head
part that controls its frightful

1066
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
part that controls its frightful
 

1067
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,510
part that controls its frightful
presence, jaws, horns, breath weapon,

1068
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
presence, jaws, horns, breath weapon,
 

1069
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,950
presence, jaws, horns, breath weapon,
and arcane spells. A wings part that

1070
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:16,960
and arcane spells. A wings part that
 

1071
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,310
and arcane spells. A wings part that
grants its ability to fly. And a main

1072
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
grants its ability to fly. And a main
 

1073
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,430
grants its ability to fly. And a main
body that covers everything else. Note

1074
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
body that covers everything else. Note
 

1075
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,710
body that covers everything else. Note
that since it takes both wings to fly,

1076
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
that since it takes both wings to fly,
 

1077
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,870
that since it takes both wings to fly,
we're combining them both into a single

1078
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
we're combining them both into a single
 

1079
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,350
we're combining them both into a single
mechanical part rather than having to

1080
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
mechanical part rather than having to
 

1081
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,590
mechanical part rather than having to
track a hit points pool for the left

1082
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
track a hit points pool for the left
 

1083
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,510
track a hit points pool for the left
wing and right wing separately. Step

1084
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
wing and right wing separately. Step
 

1085
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,190
wing and right wing separately. Step
three, we define the parts mechanically.

1086
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
three, we define the parts mechanically.
 

1087
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,470
three, we define the parts mechanically.
The head is a major concern. We don't

1088
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
The head is a major concern. We don't
 

1089
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,630
The head is a major concern. We don't
want it to be crippled too soon, and

1090
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
want it to be crippled too soon, and
 

1091
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,470
want it to be crippled too soon, and
should that happen, we want it to feel

1092
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
should that happen, we want it to feel
 

1093
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,350
should that happen, we want it to feel
like a major accomplishment. So, I'm

1094
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
like a major accomplishment. So, I'm
 

1095
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,909
like a major accomplishment. So, I'm
going to set its hit points at 40% of

1096
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
going to set its hit points at 40% of
 

1097
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,990
going to set its hit points at 40% of
the main body or 230 points. And the

1098
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
the main body or 230 points. And the
 

1099
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,470
the main body or 230 points. And the
wings are also important, but not as

1100
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
wings are also important, but not as
 

1101
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,549
wings are also important, but not as
important as the head. Plus, they're

1102
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
important as the head. Plus, they're
 

1103
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,029
important as the head. Plus, they're
mostly made of membranes. So, I set the

1104
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
mostly made of membranes. So, I set the
 

1105
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,510
mostly made of membranes. So, I set the
hit points pull for the wings at roughly

1106
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
hit points pull for the wings at roughly
 

1107
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,909
hit points pull for the wings at roughly
30% of the main body, or 170 hit points.

1108
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
30% of the main body, or 170 hit points.
 

1109
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,470
30% of the main body, or 170 hit points.
Note that if I was to impose front-end

1110
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
Note that if I was to impose front-end
 

1111
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,029
Note that if I was to impose front-end
costs like higher armor class, reflex

1112
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
costs like higher armor class, reflex
 

1113
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,909
costs like higher armor class, reflex
bonus, or resistances, I would define

1114
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
bonus, or resistances, I would define
 

1115
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,710
bonus, or resistances, I would define
those now during this step. But I think

1116
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:22,720
those now during this step. But I think
 

1117
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,110
those now during this step. But I think
I'm going to lean more into backend

1118
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm going to lean more into backend
 

1119
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,190
I'm going to lean more into backend
costs like phase changes for this

1120
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
costs like phase changes for this
 

1121
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,190
costs like phase changes for this
encounter. So there's nothing more for

1122
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
encounter. So there's nothing more for
 

1123
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,070
encounter. So there's nothing more for
me to do during this step. That brings

1124
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
me to do during this step. That brings
 

1125
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,310
me to do during this step. That brings
us to step four. Define broken effects.

1126
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
us to step four. Define broken effects.
 

1127
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,510
us to step four. Define broken effects.
If the head becomes broken, Manari loses

1128
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520
If the head becomes broken, Manari loses
 

1129
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,870
If the head becomes broken, Manari loses
his frightful presence, jaws, horns,

1130
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
his frightful presence, jaws, horns,
 

1131
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,350
his frightful presence, jaws, horns,
breath weapon, and the ability to cast

1132
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
breath weapon, and the ability to cast
 

1133
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,909
breath weapon, and the ability to cast
arcane spells. Note that breaking the

1134
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
arcane spells. Note that breaking the
 

1135
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,950
arcane spells. Note that breaking the
head does not mean his head is destroyed

1136
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
head does not mean his head is destroyed
 

1137
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,909
head does not mean his head is destroyed
and he instantly dies. It just means he

1138
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
and he instantly dies. It just means he
 

1139
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,710
and he instantly dies. It just means he
can no longer use the abilities that are

1140
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
can no longer use the abilities that are
 

1141
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,430
can no longer use the abilities that are
associated with his head part. And keep

1142
00:25:59,430 --> 00:25:59,440
associated with his head part. And keep
 

1143
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,830
associated with his head part. And keep
in mind that all the damage the players

1144
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
in mind that all the damage the players
 

1145
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,190
in mind that all the damage the players
apply to the head is also dealt to his

1146
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
apply to the head is also dealt to his
 

1147
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,070
apply to the head is also dealt to his
main body. So repeatedly slicing his

1148
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
main body. So repeatedly slicing his
 

1149
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,390
main body. So repeatedly slicing his
head with a great axe does also bring

1150
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:10,400
head with a great axe does also bring
 

1151
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,350
head with a great axe does also bring
him closer to death. As for the wings

1152
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,360
him closer to death. As for the wings
 

1153
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,669
him closer to death. As for the wings
part, we decide that when the wings are

1154
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:15,679
part, we decide that when the wings are
 

1155
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,149
part, we decide that when the wings are
broken, he can no longer fly and falls

1156
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
broken, he can no longer fly and falls
 

1157
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,070
broken, he can no longer fly and falls
to the ground if he was flying at the

1158
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
to the ground if he was flying at the
 

1159
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,590
to the ground if he was flying at the
time his wings become broken. Step five,

1160
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
time his wings become broken. Step five,
 

1161
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,390
time his wings become broken. Step five,
consider backend costs, which are

1162
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
consider backend costs, which are
 

1163
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,350
consider backend costs, which are
usually phases and triggers. Because I

1164
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
usually phases and triggers. Because I
 

1165
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,990
usually phases and triggers. Because I
don't have front-end costs for breaking

1166
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
don't have front-end costs for breaking
 

1167
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,870
don't have front-end costs for breaking
the head or wings, I need to create

1168
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
the head or wings, I need to create
 

1169
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,430
the head or wings, I need to create
back-end costs that are roughly

1170
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
back-end costs that are roughly
 

1171
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,549
back-end costs that are roughly
equivalent in value to the ability

1172
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
equivalent in value to the ability
 

1173
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,149
equivalent in value to the ability
losses. First up, the wings. We create a

1174
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
losses. First up, the wings. We create a
 

1175
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,590
losses. First up, the wings. We create a
phase titled cornered beast. The trigger

1176
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
phase titled cornered beast. The trigger
 

1177
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,710
phase titled cornered beast. The trigger
for this phase is the wings part becomes

1178
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
for this phase is the wings part becomes
 

1179
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,789
for this phase is the wings part becomes
broken. And the description for this

1180
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
broken. And the description for this
 

1181
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,590
broken. And the description for this
phase says then kar falls if he is

1182
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
phase says then kar falls if he is
 

1183
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,870
phase says then kar falls if he is
flying. He becomes quickened able to use

1184
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
flying. He becomes quickened able to use
 

1185
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,430
flying. He becomes quickened able to use
the extra action only to make melee

1186
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
the extra action only to make melee
 

1187
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,350
the extra action only to make melee
attacks or destroy. So he loses his

1188
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
attacks or destroy. So he loses his
 

1189
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,350
attacks or destroy. So he loses his
ability to fly, which is a major

1190
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
ability to fly, which is a major
 

1191
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,310
ability to fly, which is a major
tactical advantage, but gains an extra

1192
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
tactical advantage, but gains an extra
 

1193
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,029
tactical advantage, but gains an extra
action each turn that can either be used

1194
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
action each turn that can either be used
 

1195
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,510
action each turn that can either be used
for striding or making an extra melee

1196
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
for striding or making an extra melee
 

1197
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,470
for striding or making an extra melee
attack. Within the narrative, he is

1198
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
attack. Within the narrative, he is
 

1199
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,870
attack. Within the narrative, he is
angered and shows that he is able to

1200
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
angered and shows that he is able to
 

1201
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,070
angered and shows that he is able to
adapt to the loss of his wings. Now, for

1202
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
adapt to the loss of his wings. Now, for
 

1203
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,870
adapt to the loss of his wings. Now, for
the head part, we create a phase called

1204
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
the head part, we create a phase called
 

1205
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,990
the head part, we create a phase called
Worm's Fury. The trigger for this phase

1206
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
Worm's Fury. The trigger for this phase
 

1207
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,269
Worm's Fury. The trigger for this phase
is the head part becomes broken. And the

1208
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
is the head part becomes broken. And the
 

1209
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,909

one condition for the next two turns as
 

1245
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,950
one condition for the next two turns as
his focus shatters. So in this phase,

1246
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
his focus shatters. So in this phase,
 

1247
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,110
his focus shatters. So in this phase,
Manari becomes a purely physical enraged

1260
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
reaction, which can reduce incoming
 

1261
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,669
reaction, which can reduce incoming
damage to his main body. And note that

1262
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
damage to his main body. And note that
 

1263
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,470
damage to his main body. And note that
since he has two reactions per turn, he

1264
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
since he has two reactions per turn, he
 

1265
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,350
since he has two reactions per turn, he
can use this reaction twice. I also

1266
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
can use this reaction twice. I also
 

1267
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,669
can use this reaction twice. I also
included the free stride and claw

1268
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
included the free stride and claw
 

1269
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,470
included the free stride and claw
strikes and the stunned one condition

1270
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,480
strikes and the stunned one condition
 

1271
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,789
strikes and the stunned one condition
for narrative effect since they most

1272
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
for narrative effect since they most
 

1273
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,190
for narrative effect since they most
likely cancel each other out. A couple

1274
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
likely cancel each other out. A couple
 

1275
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,510
likely cancel each other out. A couple

actions used immediately for the loss of
 

1277
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,389
actions used immediately for the loss of
two actions over the next two turns. I

1278
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
two actions over the next two turns. I
 

1279
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,549
two actions over the next two turns. I
could probably end the conversion of

1280
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559
could probably end the conversion of
 

1281
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,190
could probably end the conversion of
Mari there, but as mentioned before,

1282
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
Mari there, but as mentioned before,
 

1283
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,830
Mari there, but as mentioned before,
this is definitely not an exact science

1284
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:21,840
this is definitely not an exact science
 

1285
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,789
this is definitely not an exact science
and balancing will be a challenge. To

1286
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
and balancing will be a challenge. To
 

1287
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,789
and balancing will be a challenge. To
help with that, I'm going to create a

1288
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
help with that, I'm going to create a
 

1289
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,110
help with that, I'm going to create a
third phase and trigger, which I think

1290
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,120
third phase and trigger, which I think
 

1291
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,310
third phase and trigger, which I think
of as a backpocket phase in the sense

1292
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
of as a backpocket phase in the sense
 

1293
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,710
of as a backpocket phase in the sense
that I'm not required to use it. I have

1294
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:34,720
that I'm not required to use it. I have
 

1295
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,350
that I'm not required to use it. I have
it already prepared and in my so-called

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
it already prepared and in my so-called
 

1297
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,310
it already prepared and in my so-called
back pocket, if it is needed, but if the

1298
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
back pocket, if it is needed, but if the
 

1299
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,789
back pocket, if it is needed, but if the
encounter is already too difficult, then

I don't need to use it. I'm calling this

1302
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
I don't need to use it. I'm calling this
 

1303
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,789
I don't need to use it. I'm calling this
phase righteous stand. The trigger is

1304
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
phase righteous stand. The trigger is
 

1305
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,590
phase righteous stand. The trigger is
Manari's main body is reduced to fewer

Manari's main body is reduced to fewer
 

1307
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,789
Manari's main body is reduced to fewer
than 250 hit points. And the phase

1308
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
than 250 hit points. And the phase
 

1309
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,149
than 250 hit points. And the phase
effect says Manari uses a free action to

00:29:58,149 --> 00:29:58,159
effect says Manari uses a free action to
 

1311
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,669
effect says Manari uses a free action to

ends after 1 minute or if Manari's main
 

1333
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,110
ends after 1 minute or if Manari's main
body is reduced to zero hit points. So

1334
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
body is reduced to zero hit points. So
 

1335
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,990
body is reduced to zero hit points. So
when players push Mari below less than

when players push Mari below less than
 

1337

when players push Mari below less than
50% of his hit points, I as the GM

1339
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,310
50% of his hit points, I as the GM
should have a good idea for how this

00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
should have a good idea for how this
 

1341
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,549
should have a good idea for how this
fight is going. If the players have

1342
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
fight is going. If the players have
 

1343
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,190
fight is going. If the players have
broken his head and show no signs of

worm's fury phase, I can choose to

1348
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
worm's fury phase, I can choose to
 

1349
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,990
worm's fury phase, I can choose to
activate this phase. But if the fight's

1350
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
activate this phase. But if the fight's
 

1351
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,070
activate this phase. But if the fight's

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,310
too difficult with the other phases in
effect, I can choose not to use this

1354
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
effect, I can choose not to use this
 

1355
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,110
effect, I can choose not to use this
phase. Or I can have it activate later,

1356
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
phase. Or I can have it activate later,

So, those are the basics of the system,

1372
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
So, those are the basics of the system,
 

1373
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,310
So, those are the basics of the system,
but let's do a quick review with a few

1374
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
but let's do a quick review with a few
 

1375
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,990
but let's do a quick review with a few
considerations. First, complexity. Start

1376
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,000
considerations. First, complexity. Start
 

1377
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,389
considerations. First, complexity. Start
simple with maybe only two or three

1378
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
simple with maybe only two or three
 

1379
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,590
simple with maybe only two or three
parts. You don't want or need to break a

1380
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
parts. You don't want or need to break a
 

1381
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,750
parts. You don't want or need to break a
dragon into head, wings, tail, left

1382
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
dragon into head, wings, tail, left
 

1383
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,470
dragon into head, wings, tail, left
claw, right claw, and so on. Just pick

1384
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
claw, right claw, and so on. Just pick
 

1385
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,710
claw, right claw, and so on. Just pick
two so you're not forced into more

1386
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
two so you're not forced into more
 

1387
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,430
two so you're not forced into more
bookkeeping than is needed. Think about

1388
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
bookkeeping than is needed. Think about
 

1389
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,710
bookkeeping than is needed. Think about
clarity. Since this is outside the norm

1390
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
clarity. Since this is outside the norm
 

1391
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,430
clarity. Since this is outside the norm
for Pathfinder encounters, make sure

1392
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
for Pathfinder encounters, make sure
 

1393
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,830
for Pathfinder encounters, make sure
your players understand which parts

1394
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
your players understand which parts
 

1395
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,870
your players understand which parts
exist and that they can target them.

1396
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:00,880
exist and that they can target them.
 

1397
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,509
exist and that they can target them.
Visual aids can help, such as saying a

00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
Visual aids can help, such as saying a
 

1399
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,509
Visual aids can help, such as saying a
certain part of the monster's body is a

00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
certain part of the monster's body is a
 

1401
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,389
certain part of the monster's body is a
different color or is glowing. Also

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,789
checks to get this information, but make
sure the players somehow come upon the

00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
sure the players somehow come upon the
 

1409
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,870
sure the players somehow come upon the
realization that they can target

00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
realization that they can target
 

1411
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,950
realization that they can target
different parts of the monster or all of

different parts of the monster or all of
 

1413
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,509
different parts of the monster or all of
this work is wasted. As mentioned

00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
this work is wasted. As mentioned
 

1415
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,669
this work is wasted. As mentioned
before, balance is going to be a

before, balance is going to be a

before, balance is going to be a
challenge. It's going to be difficult to

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
challenge. It's going to be difficult to
 

1419
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,909
challenge. It's going to be difficult to
manage and counterbalance when using the

to what makes narrative sense and what
 

1427
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,870
to what makes narrative sense and what
your players can handle. If you're

your players can handle. If you're

before you create a bunch of cool and
 

1437
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,509
before you create a bunch of cool and
powerful phase changes. And also

1438
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
powerful phase changes. And also
 

1439
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,750
powerful phase changes. And also
consider having that back pocket phase

1440
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
consider having that back pocket phase
 

1441
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,389
consider having that back pocket phase
prepared just in case the fight turns

prepared just in case the fight turns

prepared just in case the fight turns
out to be easier than you planned. Also

1444
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
out to be easier than you planned. Also
 

1445
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,190
out to be easier than you planned. Also
think about impact. Breaking monster

think about impact. Breaking monster

parts should feel meaningful to the

1448
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
parts should feel meaningful to the
 

1449
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,269
parts should feel meaningful to the
players and doing so should change the

1450
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
players and doing so should change the
 

1451
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,470
players and doing so should change the
fight in a noticeable way. New abilities

1452
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
fight in a noticeable way. New abilities
 

1453
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,110
fight in a noticeable way. New abilities
can replace lost abilities and phase

1454
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,120
can replace lost abilities and phase
 

1455
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,789
can replace lost abilities and phase
changes can alter the creature's

1456
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:14,799
changes can alter the creature's
 

1457
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,430
changes can alter the creature's
tactics. And last, remember the

1458
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,440
tactics. And last, remember the
 

1459
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,070
tactics. And last, remember the
downsides. There should always be a

1460
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
downsides. There should always be a
 

1461
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,630
downsides. There should always be a
downside to targeting a part rather than

1462
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
downside to targeting a part rather than
 

1463
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,630
downside to targeting a part rather than
targeting the creature's main body.

1464
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
targeting the creature's main body.
 

1465
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,870
targeting the creature's main body.
Otherwise, there is little to no reason

1466
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
Otherwise, there is little to no reason
 

1467
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,430
Otherwise, there is little to no reason
for a player not to be targeting parts

1468
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,440
for a player not to be targeting parts
 

1469
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,750
for a player not to be targeting parts
as they apply damage to both the part

1470
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
as they apply damage to both the part
 

1471
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,549
as they apply damage to both the part
and the main body at the same time. And

1472
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:34,559
and the main body at the same time. And
 

1473
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,870
and the main body at the same time. And
these downsides should take into account

1474
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
these downsides should take into account
 

1475
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,029
these downsides should take into account
that breaking apart means removing the

1476
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
that breaking apart means removing the
 

1477
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,350
that breaking apart means removing the
monster's access to certain abilities

1478
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
monster's access to certain abilities
 

1479
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,110
monster's access to certain abilities
and therefore should have a cost

1480
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,120
and therefore should have a cost
 

1481
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,509
and therefore should have a cost
associated with doing so.

1482
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
associated with doing so.
 

1483
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,750
