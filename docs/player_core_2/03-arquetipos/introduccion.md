## Chapter 3:


## Archetypes

You gain an archetype by selecting archetype feats instead
of your normal feats. First, find the archetype that best
fits your character concept. Then select that archetype’s
dedication feat, using one of your class feat choices. Once
you’ve taken the dedication feat, you can select any feat
from that archetype, as long as you meet its prerequisites.
Most archetype feats are taken in place of class feats, and
so these are called archetype class feats.
An archetype feat is subject to any restrictions on the
class feat it replaces. For example, if you had an ability at
6th level that granted you a bonus class feat, but that class
feat had to be 4th level or lower and have the dwarf trait,
you could use that class feat to take an archetype class feat,
but only one of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait.
Dedication Details
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents your character’s
effort to learn a new set of abilities, making it impossible to
split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same
time. Once you take a dedication feat, you can’t select a
different dedication feat until you complete your dedication
by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You
can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other
feats from that archetype.
Multiclass Dedications
Some archetypes in this book have the multiclass trait.
These allow you to diversify your training into another
class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s
dedication feat if you are already a member of that class.
Additional Feats
Some archetypes include a list of “Additional Feats” that
appear in other sources. The list includes each feat’s level,
which might be different than normal when gained from
the archetype. You can take the feat as an archetype feat
of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of
feats required by the archetype’s dedication feat. When
selected this way, a feat that normally has a class’s trait
(such as the fighter trait) doesn’t have that class trait.
Feats that Grant Feats
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you select another feat,
such as a class feat of a lower level. You must always meet
any prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way. These
always count as only one feat for the purposes of your
dedication; for example, taking the barbarian archetype’s
Basic Fury feat to gain the Sudden Charge class feat
counts as only one feat, not two.
Spellcasting Archetypes
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of
spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character from
a spellcasting class. A spellcasting archetype allows you
to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a
member of a spellcasting class can.
Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast
cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic
spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master
spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the
archetype; for instance, the sorcerer archetype’s master
spellcasting feat is called Master Sorcerer Spellcasting.
All spell slots you gain from spellcasting archetypes
are subject to the restrictions within the archetype. For
instance, the eldritch archer archetype allows you to pick
a spell list when you take its dedication feat. If you pick
arcane spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots
you can use only to cast arcane spells from your eldritch
archer repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with arcane
spells in your sorcerer repertoire.
Basic Spellcasting Feat: Usually available at 4th level,
these feats grant a 1st-rank spell slot. At 6th level, they
grant you a 2nd-rank spell slot, and if you have a spell
repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire
as a signature spell. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd‑rank
spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the “basic
spellcasting benefits.”
Expert Spellcasting Feat: Typically taken at 12th level,
these feats make you an expert in spell attack modifier
and spell DC and grant you a 4th-rank spell slot. If you
have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from
your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, they
grant you a 5th-rank spell slot, and at 16th level, they
grant you a 6th-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these
benefits as the “expert spellcasting benefits.”
Master Spellcasting Feat: Usually found at 18th level,
these feats make you a master in spell attack modifier
and spell DC and grant you a 7th-rank spell slot. If you
have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from
your repertoire as a signature spell. At 20th level, they

173

grant you an 8th-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these
benefits as the “master spellcasting benefits.”
Alchemical Archetypes
Some archetypes give you the ability to use alchemy in a
similar manner to an alchemist and say that you get the
advanced alchemy benefits or Quick Alchemy benefits.
Advanced Alchemy Benefits: You gain the Alchemical
Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t already have it.
In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows you to
create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables
each day during your daily preparations without the normal
cost or time expenditure, as described on page 58. If you
gain advanced alchemy from more than one source, use the
highest number of alchemical consumables per day rather
than adding them together, but you can make items of any
type allowed by any of your advanced alchemy abilities. For
instance, Herbalist Dedication lets you create 4 alchemical
consumables with the healing trait, and Poisoner Dedication
lets you create four alchemical poison consumables. If you
had both feats, you could create 4 total consumables, but
they could be any combination of healing and poison items.
Quick Alchemy Benefits: You gain the Alchemical
Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t already have it.
In addition, you gain the Quick Alchemy action (page 59),
which lets you create short-lived alchemical consumables
with a special action, and you can create a certain number of
versatile vials during your daily preparations to fuel Quick
Alchemy. Unless otherwise noted, you can’t regain versatile
vials throughout the day the way alchemists can. The
individual archetype tells you how many versatile vials you
can create each day, and might impose special restrictions or
benefits for how you can use them. If you gain versatile vials
from more than one source, you use the highest number of
vials to determine your maximum rather than adding them
together, but you can use the vials for any Quick Alchemy
option or other use of versatile vials you possess.
Temporary Items
Several archetypes allow you to prepare temporary items.
Much like the infused items created by alchemists, these
temporary items last only a short time before becoming
useless. Examples include temporary scrolls created by
the scroll trickster and temporary weapons, armor, or
adventuring gear created by the scrounger.
Temporary items are clearly not up to the same quality
as other items, so they typically can’t be sold. If an ability
doesn’t list how long a temporary item lasts, the item lasts
until the next time you make your daily preparations. Any
effect created by a temporary item also ends at that time if
it hasn’t already (unless it’s a permanent effect).
Special Archetypes
Some archetype feats have the skill trait, allowing you to
take them in place of a skill feat rather than a class feat.
A skill feat still counts to satisfy the requirement of the
dedication. Other books contain class archetypes that can
modify your class’s abilities as soon as 1st level. You can
never have more than one class archetype.

## Key Terms

You’ll see these terms within this chapter’s archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from spellshape feats. You must use the spellshape action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a
spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
spellshape action itself.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action,
whichever comes first. After you take an action with the
stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You
can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You
can Dismiss a stance.

Alchemist
You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and
substances in your spare time, and your studies have
progressed beyond mere experimentation. You might
throw bombs, drink mutagens, or carry an assortment
of helpful elixirs and alchemical tools.
Multiclass Alchemist Characters
The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype
are extremely useful to characters of any class. The
following are just some of the possible combinations.
- Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their
rage to ferocious effect.
- Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items
that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their
champion’s reaction and lay on hands to go further.
- Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain
additional options in situations where their usual
tactics don’t work.
- Ranger alchemists often focus on alchemy and
snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill
and supplying bombs for the bomb snare.
- Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison
feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an
interesting way to sneak attack with various types
of energy damage.
- Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical
items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared
spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew
up darkvision elixirs to grant vision in darkness can
prepare another spell instead of darkvision.

Barbarian
There’s a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks
loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in
addition to your other abilities.
Multiclass Barbarian Characters
The barbarian archetype is a great choice for characters
who emphasize Strength and melee attacks more than
usual for their class, as long as they can handle Rage’s
spellcasting restriction. It’s especially good for characters
looking to add more damage.
- Alchemist barbarians can enhance themselves with
potent mutagens before releasing their fury.
- Champion barbarians might enter a zealous rage
when their deity is offended and diplomacy is no
longer an option.
- Druid barbarians transform into mighty beasts and
monsters before entering a rage.
- Monk barbarians can use the enhanced emotional
state of rage to flow with their stance.
- Rogue barbarians are ruffians who thrive in a scrap
and are happy to let their anger take control.
- Spellcaster barbarians might wait until they’re out
of better options, using rage as a last resort.

such as Nethys for a wizard.

## Champion Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication Multiclass

Prerequisites Strength +2, Charisma +2

armor, you gain training in heavy armor as well. Whenever
you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater
proficiency in any type of armor (but not unarmored
defense), you also gain that proficiency in the armor
types granted to you by this feat. If you have a

Investigator
You’ve developed a keen eye for investigating mysteries.
Multiclass Investigator Characters
The investigator archetype is a good choice for a

and wizards.
- Alchemist investigators double down on science
and alchemy to better search for clues.

decide the optimal time to switch from defense to

Monk
Monastic training has taught you martial arts and
allowed you to hone your mind, body, and spirit.
Multiclass Monk Characters
The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character
who fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks.
Multiclassed monks are typically more centered,
philosophical, and disciplined than other members of
their class.
- Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can
combine the barbarian’s excellent unarmed damage
with the monk’s diverse unarmed special abilities.
- Champion monks are perfect for champions of Irori
or other deities who favor unarmed attacks.
- Fighter monks can supplement free-hand fighting
and add mobility to the fighter’s toolkit.

stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks
and flurry gives more sneak attacks.

abilities with haste, runic body, or similar spells to
mix magic and martial arts.

179

Oracle
A mysterious force granted you divine magic and a curse.
Multiclass Oracle Characters
The oracle archetype is a great choice for characters who
want to use powerful cursebound abilities that come at
a cost. It’s especially good for characters looking to add
some high-risk, high-reward options.
- Martial oracles can use powerful cursebound
abilities to access unique magical effects.

pool of options at the cost of a curse.

181

Swashbuckler
You fight with flair and style, adding swashbuckling
tricks to your combat repertoire.
Multiclass Swashbuckler Characters
The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial
characters who want to be a bit flashier or for Charismabased
spellcasters who want to add a bit of dramatic
flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers work
especially well for characters who already want to
incorporate skill-based action and seek out daring deeds
to do in the heat of battle.
- Barbarian swashbucklers love to show off their
strength and brutality with devastating finishers.
- Champion swashbucklers can show off the powers
of their deity to inspire awe in potential converts
and fear in enemies of the faith.
- Investigator swashbucklers might love to solve big
cases with an audience to show off their prowess.
- Monk swashbucklers can take full advantage of
their perfectly trained bodies to perform impressive
feats.
- Rogue swashbucklers might hide in the shadows
before emerging to put on a flashy show.

their mastery of both martial and magical arts.

seemingly superhuman feats of grace and agility. You
move in ways that leave your opponents fumbling for
a response, turning every fight into a nimble piece of

assassins, and explorers.

Escape using Acrobatics, the creature you Escaped from is
off-guard against the next attack you make against it before
the end of your next turn.
### Dodge Away [reaction] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Acrobat Dedication

## Graceful Leaper Feat 7

Archaeologist
Adventurers raid tombs for material gain, but true
archaeologists treasure the knowledge attained from
such sites. You might accomplish your goals with
scholarly learning, by training to overcome the tricks
and traps set by ancient peoples and rivals, through
magical training, or even with a bit of inexplicable luck.
Many archaeologists practice a combination of all these
approaches. Regardless of method, all archaeologists
possess a deep desire to learn more about sapient history
and prehistory. Adventuring through tombs, dodging
traps, and studying magic are all means to better
understand ancient sites, analyze artifacts, and decipher
the meaning of any remains that can be found from
previous inhabitants. You decide how you will uncover
the secrets of the past and what to do with the answers
you find.
Additional Feats: 4th Trap Finder (page 107); 10th

## Archetype Fortune

Prerequisites Archaeologist Dedication
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You fail a check against a trap, such as a Thievery

check and use the new result.
### Greater Magical Scholastics  FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Magical Scholastics
You broaden the scope of your magical understanding,
allowing you to find the right path, detect hidden objects, and
conceal those objects from unscrupulous rivals. You can cast
augury, locate, and veil of privacy as occult innate spells, each
once per day. You can cast this veil of privacy spell only on
an object, and it’s automatically heightened to half your level
rounded up.

Archer
Bows of all types are powerful weapons. Generals and
hunters alike recognize the power in dealing death from
a distance, and from behind safe cover. Those dedicated
to the bow—from mysterious cloaked strangers to
heartless snipers—are often viewed with a mixture of
respect and fear. Like any weapons adept, the archer’s
skill is forged through experience and constant practice.
A true archer becomes one with their bow and is able to
make incredible shots with their weapon that most would
consider impossible, or at the very least magical.
Additional Feats: 4th Assisting Shot (Player Core
141), Crossbow Ace (Player Core 157), Point Blank
Stance (Player Core 140); 6th Double Shot (Player
Core 143), Parting Shot (Player Core 143), Running

145); 10th Mobile Shot Stance (Player Core 146); 18th
Multishot Stance (Player Core 150); 20th Impossible

## Archer Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

You have familiarity with all weapons in the bow
and crossbow weapon groups. For the purposes of
proficiency, treat any of these that are martial weapons
as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as
martial weapons.

are using, you get the critical specialization effect of that
weapon when you get a critical hit with it.
### Quick Shot [one-action] FEAT 4

Interact to draw a weapon from the bow or crossbow

With a quick use of brute force, you remove an obstacle and
take a calculated shot as part of the same motion. Attempt to
Shove or Trip one adjacent creature, then make a ranged Strike
with a bow or crossbow you’re wielding. The Strike is made at
the same multiple attack penalty as the Shove or Trip attempt,
and this activity counts as one attack when calculating your
multiple attack penalty.

185

Assassin
Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the
expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in
ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral
code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who
revel in unchecked aggression or power.
Additional Feats: 4th Poison Resistance (Player
Core 129); 6th Poison Weapon (Player Core 171); 10th
Improved Poison Weapon (Player Core 173)

## Assassin Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Deception and Stealth
You’ve trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with
tenacity and precision. You gain the Mark for Death activity.
Mark for Death [three-actions] (concentrate) Requirements The creature
you intend to mark is observed by you; Effect You designate
a single creature as your mark. Using Mark for Death while
hidden or undetected doesn’t make you observed. Mark for
Death lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death
again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception
checks to Seek your mark, as well as to Deception checks to
Feint against your mark. Your mark takes a –2 circumstance
penalty to all Perception checks to Seek you.
In addition, when attacking your mark, you have the
sneak attack class feature (Player Core 167), except it deals
1d4 precision damage and you don’t increase the number of
dice as you gain levels. At 6th level, the damage increases
to 1d6. If you already have the sneak attack class feature,
you instead deal an additional 1 precision damage with your
sneak attacks made against your mark, increasing to 2
precision damage at 6th level.

## Expert Backstabber Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
You excel at quickly dispatching your foes.
When you Strike an off-guard foe with a
weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait,
you deal 2 extra precision damage instead of
1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 4
extra precision damage instead of 2.

## Surprise Attack Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
You act before foes can react. On the first round of
combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative,
creatures that haven’t acted are off-guard to you.
### Angel Of Death  FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
All your Strikes against a creature you have Marked for Death
have the death trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed
when reduced to 0 Hit Points. In addition, if the creature is
killed this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to
life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail
unless the effect’s counteract rank is higher than half your
level rounded up, or originates from an artifact or a deity.
Use the level you were when you killed the creature, even
if your level is higher at the time the attempt was made.
### Assassinate [two-actions] FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
Requirements You have designated a mark using Mark for
Death and are completely unnoticed by your mark.
You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay
your mark. Make a Strike against your mark. If you hit, your
mark takes an additional 6d6 precision damage with a basic
Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell
DC. If the mark critically fails, it dies unless its level is higher
than yours. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is
temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.

Bastion
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but
you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In
your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield
between you and your enemies. You’ve focused your
training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself
and those around you. Darting around in search of
cover isn’t necessary when you carry your cover with
you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a
mobile fortress. You repel assaults and stand strong
against the tide of enemies, secure in the knowledge
that you have your most trusted companion at your
side: your shield. This long-lasting fighting style has
existed for ages due to its practicality and propensity
for survival among its practitioners. While some prefer
the nimbleness of a free hand or the power of a larger
weapon, a bastion knows that surviving a little bit
longer is worth more than a quicker or stronger attack.
Additional Feats: 6th Shielded Stride (Player Core
143); 8th Reflexive Shield (Player Core 145), Shield
Warden (page 96); 10th Quick Shield Block (page 97);
12th Mirror Shield (Player Core 148); 18th Improved
Reflexive Shield (Player Core 150)

## Bastion Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites Shield Block
You are particularly skilled at using a shield to protect yourself
in combat. You gain the Reactive Shield fighter feat (Player
Core 140).
### Disarming Block [free-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication, trained in Athletics
Trigger You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a
held weapon.
With deft and practiced movement, you block at an angle to
potentially dislodge the weapon. You attempt to Disarm the
creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they
attacked you with. You can do so even if you don’t have
a hand free.
### Nimble Shield Hand  FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even
while using the hand that’s holding it for other tasks that
require the dexterity of a hand. The hand you use to wield a
shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the Interact
action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you
still can’t use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn’t apply
to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.

## Destructive Block Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense
of your shield. When you Shield Block, you can reduce the
damage to yourself by double the shield’s Hardness, but if you
do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it
would have taken (before applying its Hardness). You can’t use
Destructive Block if your shield can’t typically be broken or
destroyed, such as if you’re using an indestructible shield.

## Shield Salvation Feat 12


## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can save your shield from total destruction, even after
a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to
damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains
intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until
you take the time to repair it thoroughly, preventing you from
using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next
preparations.

187

Beastmaster
You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers
increase, you can command more of them, briefly
inhabit their body to perceive what they perceive, and
even communicate with them over vast distances.
Additional Feats: 4th Animal Empathy (Player Core
158), Initiate Warden (heal companion and magic hide
only, Player Core 157); 6th Advanced Warden (enlarge
companion only, Player Core 159), Companion’s Cry
(Player Core 159); 14th Side by Side (Player Core
162). Warden spells granted by any of these feats are
beastmaster focus spells for you.

## Beastmaster Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Nature
You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels
with you and obeys your commands. The rules for animal
companions appear on page 206 of Player Core. Contrary to
the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you
a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one
animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See
the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on
this action.
Certain beastmaster feats give you focus spells. The rules
for focus spells appear on page 298 of Player Core. When
you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become
trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics.
Your key spellcasting attribute for beastmaster archetype
spells is Charisma, and they are primal spells. You can
Refocus by feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an
animal companion.

## Additional Companion Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal
companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster
Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal
companions works.
Special You can select this feat more than once, gaining an
additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of
four total companions from all sources.
### Mature Beastmaster Companion  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature
animal companions and gaining additional capabilities (Player
Core 211).
Your animal companion has greater independence. During
an encounter, even if you don’t use the Command an Animal
action, your active animal companion can still use 1 action that
round on your turn to Stride or Strike. It can do this at any
point during your turn, as long as you aren’t currently taking
an action. If it does, that’s all the actions it gets that round—
you can’t Command it later.

## Beastmaster’S Trance Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
You can enter a trance that allows you to briefly inhabit
the body of one of your animal companions and share its
senses. You gain the focus spell beastmaster trance.
### Swift Guardian [free-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype Concentrate

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion
Trigger You roll initiative.

When danger appears, you quickly send away your active
companion and call in a different animal ally. You use Call
Companion. The new animal companion typically arrives in the
same location as the one that departed, though the GM might
adjust this depending on the circumstances and Speeds of the
animals. If you have Lead the Pack, you can swap one of your
two active companions for an inactive companion.
### Incredible Beastmaster Companion  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Mature Beastmaster Companion
Your mature animal companions continue to grow and develop.
Each of them becomes a nimble or savage animal companion,
gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of
companion (Player Core 211). You choose nimble or savage
individually for each companion, including any companion
that becomes mature after you take this feat.

## Beastmaster Bond Feat 10


## Archetype Mental Primal

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
You can communicate telepathically with your animal
companions within 100 feet. If you’re legendary in Nature, you
can communicate telepathically with your animal companions
anywhere on the planet.
BEASTMASTER’S CALL [one-action] FEAT 12

## Archetype Auditory Concentrate Primal

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion
Frequency once per turn
You quickly call in a primal projection of a non-active companion
to provide the companion’s support benefit. The projection
arrives in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet
of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears at
the start of your next turn. The projection has the same AC and
saving throw modifiers as the real companion, and if it would
take any damage before your next turn, it disappears, and the
support benefit ends immediately.
### Specialized Beastmaster Companion  FEAT 14

## Archetype

Prerequisites Incredible Beastmaster Companion
Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning
enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one
specialization of your choice (Player Core 211). Choose the
specialization separately for each companion, including any
companion that becomes specialized after you take this feat.
Special You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add
a different specialization to each of your nimble and savage
companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have
up to three specializations each.
### Lead The Pack  FEAT 16

## Uncommon Archetype

Prerequisites Mature Beastmaster Companion, you have
multiple animal companions
You can have up to two animal companions active at once.
However, when you do, it’s slightly more difficult to Command
them. If you don’t Command either of your companions, one
of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn
to Stride or Strike, per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but
not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose one
of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else each
companion can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way,
you can’t Command an Animal to make either companion act
again until your next turn.
Beastmaster Focus Spells
BEASTMASTER TRANCE [three-actions] FOCUS 3
### Uncommon Archetype Concentrate Focus Manipulate Mental
Range 1 mile; Targets one animal companion you can perceive
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You enter a trance that allows you to see through the senses
of the target companion. You attempt Perception checks using
your own Perception, but you share special senses the target
has, such as low-light vision. This spell grants no special
method of communication with the chosen animal.
For the duration of the trance, your own senses are muted.
This lack of awareness makes you off-guard. You can’t take
actions with the attack or move traits.
Heightened (6th) Increase the range to 100 miles and the
duration of sustained up to 10 minutes. The target can hear
you through the spell, allowing you to Command the Animal
or use other actions that have the auditory trait.
Heightened (8th) Increase the range to planetary and the
duration of sustained up to 1 hour. You can communicate
telepathically with the target for the duration of the trance.
Beastmaster Animal Companions
If you’re playing a beastmaster, you determine the
statistics and abilities of your animal companions
according to the rules on pages 206–211 of Player Core.
As a beastmaster, it’s possible for you to have more
than one animal companion at one time—up to four
companions—but only one of those companions, your
“active companion,” follows you during exploration and
in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or
hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal
companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also
gain Call Companion to switch your active companion.
These rules apply to all your companions, regardless
of whether you got the animal companion from the
beastmaster archetype or from another source.

## Call Companion


## Exploration

You spend 1 minute calling for a different animal
companion, switching your active companion for another
of your animal companions.

189

Blessed One
Through luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry
the blessing of a deity. This blessing manifests as the
ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions,
and exists independent of any worship. You might
offer gratitude daily to the deity whose power you
wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly,
seeking to avoid responsibility or even openly acting
to defy the deity’s influence on you. You might wear
the robes of the deity’s order, or you might give little
thought and even less reverence to the source of your
powers. However you feel about these potent gifts,
there can be no doubt that you wield a special power.
Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed
one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as
long as they’re capable of granting a healing divine font
to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu
might grant the blessed one’s powers for their own
purposes. Despite this possibility, it’s quite uncommon
for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant
the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the
deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift.
Ultimately, you decide how you will use this gift. Will
you aid the deity who granted you this power, or will
you work in defiance of them?
Additional Feats: 6th Mercy (page 95); 10th Greater
Mercy (page 97); 14th Affliction Mercy (page 97); 20th
Rejuvenating Touch (page 99), Ultimate Mercy (page
99)
### Blessed One Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to
alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the lay on hands
devotion spell (page 256). The rules for focus spells appear
on page 298 of Player Core. You can Refocus by meditating,
whether you reflect on the deity granting the blessing or
not, allowing your blessing to refill your focus pool. Your
devotion spells from the blessed one archetype are divine
spells. You become trained in spell attack modifier and spell
DC. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.

## Blessed Sacrifice Feat 4

spell (Player Core page 378).

## Archetype Concentrate Spellshape

Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication, ability to cast spells
from spell slots, Mercy
Frequency once per 10 minutes
When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove
harmful conditions. If your next action is to Cast a Spell
from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally,
you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from
that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed
by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats
such as Greater Mercy. Attempt a counteract check based
on the spell’s DC and rank. This effect is in addition to the
normal effects of your spell.
### Blessed Denial [reaction] FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication
Trigger An ally within 30 feet would become frightened,
drained, enfeebled, sickened, or stupefied.
You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful
condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the
condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the
ally has more than one eligible condition at the same time,
choose one to reduce.

Bounty Hunter
Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to
track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You’re
accustomed to perusing wanted posters, following up
on leads, and pursuing your quarry to hell and back.
Once you locate your prey’s trail, you’re unshakable.
Additionally, you have the skills and experience to subdue
even the most troublesome mark and bring them in to
secure your reward.

157); 14th Double Prey (Player Core 162)

gain the Hunt Prey action (Player Core 154). You can use Hunt
Prey to designate a creature that you’ve observed, heard
about, or learned about through some other means, such as
a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other
benefits of Hunt Prey, you can designate a target as your
prey while Gathering Information about them, in addition to
designating them as your prey when Tracking them as normal.
If you have already identified your target and selected them
as your prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to
Gather Information about them.
If you already have Hunt Prey, you gain the Monster Hunter
feat in addition to the other benefits of this feat.

your prey, and to Gather Information about your prey. You and
the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.
These benefits lasts until you designate a new prey or
your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature
assisting you loses this benefit if they’re out of your presence
for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1
hour, but is determined by the GM.
### Tools Of The Trade  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
You’re well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties
back in one piece, or at least alive. You have familiarity with the
bola, sap, and whip; for the purposes of proficiency, you treat
these weapons as simple weapons. You deal an additional 1d4
precision damage with these weapons when using them to make
nonlethal Strikes against your prey while they’re off‑guard to you.
In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal
attack with a weapon without the nonlethal trait.
### Keep Pace [reaction] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
Trigger Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away
from you.
Once you are upon your prey, they can’t escape. Stride up to
your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout
its movement until it stops moving or you’ve moved your full
Speed. You can use Keep Pace to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim
instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
### Opportunistic Grapple [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
Trigger Your prey critically fails on an attack roll against you
with a melee Strike.
Requirements Your prey is within your reach, you have one free
hand, and your target is no more than one size larger than you.
You use an opening to capture your prey. You attempt an Athletics
check to Grapple your prey.

191

Cavalier
You are a skilled and dedicated warrior on the battlefield
who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal
companion that serves as your mount. You and your
mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared
intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might
wield a banner in the name of an order of which you’re
a member, a liege to whom you’ve sworn your service,
or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to
further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers.
Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop
majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of
animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to
dinosaurs. What’s important is not the type of mount but
the connection between the cavalier and their companion.
This bond is their true strength.

## Cavalier Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Nature or Society
You gain a young animal companion (Player Core 206) that
serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions
with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options
from your pledge (see Cavalier Pledges sidebar, page 193), as
determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion
that’s at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually
starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that
animal (changing no statistics other than its size).
Special If you have pledged yourself to a cause, you can take a
second dedication feat closely tied to that cause even if you
haven’t taken two additional cavalier feats. For instance,
if you pledged yourself to fight crime with a group of
vigilantes, you could take the vigilante dedication without
first completing the cavalier archetype. The GM determines
what archetypes, if any, are valid choices.

## Cavalier’S Banner Feat 4

### Uncommon Archetype Aura Emotion Mental Visual
Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You have pledged your service to a specific
organization or ideal (see Cavalier Pledges sidebar, page 193).
You fly the banner of your pledge from your mount, raising
your allies’ spirits. You and all allies in a 30-foot emanation
from your mount gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves
and DCs against fear effects. If your banner is destroyed or
removed, allies within 30 feet become frightened 1.
CAVALIER’S CHARGE [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You are riding your mount.
You Command an Animal to order your mount to Stride
twice. At any point during this movement, you can Strike
one enemy within reach or within the first range increment
of a ranged weapon. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
your attack roll.

## Impressive Mount Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
You’ve trained your mount to become a
powerful force on the battlefield. The mount
you gained through the Cavalier Dedication
feat becomes a mature animal companion,
granting it additional capabilities.
Your mount has greater independence.
During an encounter, even if you don’t use
the Command an Animal action, your mount
can still use 1 action that round on your turn to
Stride or Strike. It can do this at any point during
your turn, as long as you aren’t currently taking
an action. If it does, that’s all the actions it gets
that round—you can’t Command it later.

### Quick Mount [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication, expert in Nature
Requirements You are adjacent to a creature that is at least
one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.
You and your mount can spring into action at a moment’s
notice. You Mount the creature and Command an Animal to
issue it an order of your choice.
### Defend Mount [reaction] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Trigger An enemy makes a Strike or spell attack against your
mount while you’re riding it.
You interpose yourself between an attacker and your mount,
defending your mount from harm. Use your own defense
against the triggering attack instead your mount’s defense. If
the triggering attack hits, you take the effects of the attack
instead of your mount.

## Mounted Shield Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
You’ve trained with your shield to defend both yourself and
your mount. When you Raise a Shield while mounted, both
you and your mount gain the shield’s circumstance bonus to
AC. If you have the Shield Block reaction, you can use it when
your mount would take physical damage, as long as you’re
riding your mount. If you do, the shield prevents your mount
from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking
damage, following the normal rules for Shield Block.

## Incredible Mount Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Impressive Mount
Under your care and training, your mount has realized its
innate potential. The mount you gained through the Cavalier
Dedication feat becomes a nimble or savage animal companion
(your choice), gaining additional capabilities determined by
the type of companion.
### Trampling Charge [three-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You are riding a mount that has a melee Strike
using its legs (claw, talons, hoof, etc.).
You urge your mount to charge into the fray, trampling all
enemies who stand in your path. You command your mount
to Stride up to double its Speed (or to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or
Swim, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving
through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size
smaller than your mount. Your mount deals the damage of
one of its melee Strikes to each creature whose space you
move through, with a basic Reflex save against your mount’s
Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes
off-guard until the end of your next turn. Roll the damage only
once. You can damage a given creature only once during this
movement.
### Unseat [one-action] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You are riding your mount and wielding a
jousting weapon.
With a mighty blow from atop your companion, you attempt
to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee Strike
against a mounted creature. If your attack hits, attempt
an Athletics check against the target’s Fortitude DC. If you
succeed, the target is knocked off its mount into a space of
its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, the
target also lands prone.

## Specialized Mount Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Incredible Mount
You’ve trained your mount to perform in unusual or even
extreme circumstances, granting it abilities far beyond others
of its kind. Your mount gains one specialization of your choice.
Special You can select this feat up to three times. Each time,
add a different specialization to your mount. Your mount
can’t have more than three specializations.

## Legendary Rider Feat 20


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
You and your mount move like one being, effortlessly reading
each other’s signals and synchronizing even in the thick of
battle. Whenever you’re riding your mount, you are quickened;
you can use the extra action only to command your mount
using the Command an Animal skill action.

## Cavalier Pledges

Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific
organization or individual, such as a noble family or
sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization,
or particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal
must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it
has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid’s animal
order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier
pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the
same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge
yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema,
you should work with your GM to determine the edicts
and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers
who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain
abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier’s Banner.
If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose
access to those feats until you benefit from an atone
ritual (Player Core 390). Changing the subject of your
pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature.

193

Celebrity
You’re a special personality... and you know it. You’re not
merely comfortable in the spotlight, you crave it. While
the traditional celebrity is a musician or another type
of performer, you could be known for any occupation.
You know how to use your position to command the
attention of others or steal it away from those around
you. While you’re in a room all eyes are on you, and you
love it. Your life is a show, and you are here to steal the
love and admiration of everyone watching.

## Celebrity Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

The more people you have looking at you, the more content
you are, and you take every opportunity to show up others
when their performances are less than perfect. You gain
the Upstage reaction. In addition, when you Earn Income, if
the level of the task is higher than your level, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your check to Earn Income.
Upstage [reaction] Trigger An enemy attempts a skill check and
doesn’t get a critical success; Effect After your foe has tried
their best, you show everyone how it’s really done. Attempt
a check using the same skill that triggered this reaction. The
DC is typically the same as the check the enemy attempted,
though the GM can adjust this as usual.
Critical Success You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls,
Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks until
the end of your next turn.
Success As critical success, except you gain the benefits
only if the triggering creature failed their skill check.
### Never Tire [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication
Trigger You would gain the fatigued condition.
Requirements You are observed by at least three creatures
who aren’t enemies.
As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform
even when you are on the brink of collapse. Indeed, you must—
you have an obligation to your fans! You delay the effects of
the fatigued condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer
observed by at least three creatures who aren’t enemies,
whichever comes first. If the fatigued condition has a duration,
the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can’t
further delay or prevent the fatigued condition after this
ability ends.
### Mesmerizing Gaze [two-actions] FEAT 6
### Archetype Concentrate Emotion Mental Visual
Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication
When you meet someone’s gaze, they’re unable to look away
from you. Choose one target creature you can see and that
can see you. That creature must succeed at a Will save or
be fascinated with you until the end of your next turn; the
DC is the higher of your class DC or spell DC. If the creature
succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a hostile
action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing
Gaze for 1 day.
### Command Attention [one-action] FEAT 10
### Archetype Auditory Aura Concentrate Emotion Mental Visual
Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication
You command the attention of all around you with style,
ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of
your next turn. Whenever a creature in a 30-foot emanation
around you attempts a saving throw against a different
visual effect, it gets a result one degree of success better
than it rolled. This is a fortune effect.
When an enemy within the aura attempts to use a visual
effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular
creature (such as a medusa’s Focus Gaze), it must succeed at
a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is
higher, in order to target any creature except you.
Allies in the aura can attempt to Hide even if they don’t
have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction.

Dandy
You are a genteel master of style, culture, and decorum,
aware of even the subtlest rules of etiquette.

## Dandy Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You are a consummate student of dignity, etiquette, and
fashion. You become trained in Deception and Society; if you
were already trained in either, you become an expert in it
instead. You gain the Influence Rumor downtime activity.
Influence Rumor (downtime) You spend at least 1 day of
downtime attempting to manipulate the course, tone, or
content of a rumor to your benefit. You need to succeed
at a Diplomacy check to shift the rumor as you intend. The
difficulty is determined by the GM based on the size of the
community, the relative perceptiveness of the inhabitants,
and the agency of other rumormongers, but it typically is no
lower than DC 15 for a small village, DC 20 for a town, DC
30 for a city, or DC 40 for a metropolis.
### Distracting Flattery [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, expert in Deception
Trigger You observe a target’s attitude toward yourself or your
allies decrease as a result of an ally’s behavior.
You know how to maintain a good impression and manage
your image, even while keeping uncouth company. Make
a Deception check against the target’s Will DC. Regardless
of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your
Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.
Success The target’s attitude doesn’t decrease as a result of
your ally’s social blunder.
Failure The target’s attitude decreases as normal.
Critical Failure Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing
the target’s attitude toward you by one step, in addition to
any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.

## Gossip Lore Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication
Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed
on every topic. You are trained in Gossip Lore, a special Lore
skill that can be used only to Recall Knowledge, but on any
topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore,
you get the effects of the Dubious Knowledge skill feat (Player
Core 254).
If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain
expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can’t increase your
proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.

## Fabricated Connections Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in Deception
You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that
you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully
completed it. You can roll Deception in place of a different
skill when attempting to Earn Income, Make an Impression,
Request, or Subsist. You can use Fabricated Connections to
Make an Impression or Request once per day, and you can also
use it once per week to Earn Income or Subsist.

## Party Crasher Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in Society
You attend all the fashionable society parties, no matter how
exclusive they might be. Any time you encounter a social event
you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation,
royal gala, or other society function, you can spend 1d4 hours
to secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find
invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary
jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way,
or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies. This
ability doesn’t apply to secret events or other small private
gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved.

195

Dual-Weapon Warrior
You’re able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons
simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a
storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best
form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to
avoid your whirlwind of weapons. Your unconventional
fighting style still manages to weave in a unique kind of
defense, blocking blade with blade, all without sacrificing
power. Speed is your friend, and stagnation can mean
ruin. Your attacks come fast and from unexpected angles.
Become one with the blur of weapons and find victory.
Additional Feats: 4th Quick Draw (Player Core 159);
6th Twin Parry (Player Core 144); 12th Twin Riposte
(Player Core 148); 16th Improved Twin Riposte (Player
Core 150), Two-Weapon Flurry (Player Core 150); 18th
Twinned Defense (Player Core 150)
### Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You’re exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the
Double Slice fighter feat (Player Core 140).

## Dual Thrower Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with
them. Whenever a feat you gained from the dual-weapon
warrior archetype allows you to make a melee Strike, you
can instead make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon or
a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding (weapons that
need “1+” hand, such as longbows, don’t qualify). Any effects
from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or
melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and
ranged Strikes.
### Dual-Weapon Reload [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to
reload while holding two weapons. While you’re wielding
two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, you don’t
need a free hand to reload a one-handed ranged weapon
you’re wielding.
### Flensing Slice [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements Your last action was a Double Slice, and both
attacks hit the target.
When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense
the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The
target takes 1d8 persistent bleed damage per weapon damage
die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most
weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a major striking
weapon). In addition, until the start of your next turn the
target is off-guard, and its resistances to any physical damage
types are reduced by 5.
### Dual-Weapon Blitz [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements You are wielding two onehanded
melee weapons, each in a different
hand.
You attack as you weave your way around the
battlefield. Stride up to your Speed. During this
movement, you can Strike once with each of the
two one-handed melee weapons. Each of these
Strikes can be made at any point during your
movement.

## Dual Onslaught Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Dedication
When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for
the target to escape your attack. When you use Double Slice,
if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons
and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can’t
choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a
critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack
rolls were critical failures.

Duelist
All across the world, students in fencing academies
practice with their weapons to master one-on-one
combat. The libraries of these schools contain troves of
information, detailing hundreds of combat techniques,
battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement.
Those who gain admission to such training classes
might duel in formalized settings—and that’s certainly
the more genteel route to take. However, others assert
that there’s no better training ground for duels than
the chaotic life of an adventurer. In such situations, a
flexible, single‑handed fighting style is invaluable. You
never know when you’ll need an extra hand to shove
a foe, haul open a door, or grab valuable loot. You can
accomplish such deeds with style and grace. Regardless
of your method, fighters such as you are feared across
the land.
Additional Feats: 4th Dueling Parry (Player Core
141); 8th Disarming Stance (Player Core 145); 10th
Dueling Riposte (Player Core 146); 12th Disarming
Twist (Player Core 147); 14th Dueling Dance (Player
Core 149), Improved Dueling Riposte (Player Core
149); 16th Guiding Riposte (Player Core 150)

## Duelist Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in light armor and simple weapons
You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel,
no matter the circumstances. You gain the Quick Draw feat
(Player Core 159), enabling you to both draw and attack with
a weapon as 1 action.
DUELIST’S CHALLENGE [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Duelist Dedication
Select one enemy you can see and proclaim a challenge
against it. That enemy is your dueling opponent until it’s
defeated, it flees from the encounter, or the encounter ends.
Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed
melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you
gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike’s damage equal to
the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent,
you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the
number of damage dice your weapon deals.

## Selfless Parry Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Duelist Dedication, Dueling Parry
You protect those near to you with a flash of steel
and a stroke of good luck. When you’re benefiting
from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have Dueling
Riposte, you can use it when an enemy within your
reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you,
not just against yourself.
### Student Of The Dueling Arts  FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Duelist Dedication
Dueling is your art, and your weapon is your instrument.
You have studied and evaluated a great many combat
techniques, which you can review each day without fail to
ensure you are prepared for any and every situation that
may occur. During your daily preparations, you can swap
out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other
duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which
you are qualified. You can’t swap out Duelist Dedication or
Student of the Dueling Arts in this way.
In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist
archetype feat you don’t have (such as one listed under
Additional Feats) by increasing the number of actions it
takes to enter the stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You
must still meet the stance feat’s prerequisites.

197

Eldritch Archer
While many archers see their craft as an art form as
much as a means of battle, a small number of archers
seek to perfect their skills through magic, and you
are among their number. Bolstering your athletic and
martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare
heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming arrows
or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending projectiles
zig‑zagging unerringly to their targets, and manifesting
arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. The
imbuing of raw magic into the point of an arrow is no
easy feat. Eldritch archers are respected and feared for
their prowess and make valuable members for any party
of adventurers.
While having some spellcasting ability increases
your flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you
might learn the secrets of these arts without being
independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the
magic of the bow for its own sake. In fact, many eldritch
archers begin as archers first and spellcasters second.
That is not to say that the occasional spellcaster has not
picked up archery. In fact, many wizards, wise in the art
of war, have studied the bow, particularly to master this
art. Ultimately, what matters is a perfect combination of
martial skill and magical ability; the order you go about
obtaining them matters little.
Additional Feats: 8th Running Reload (Player Core
159); 20th Impossible Volley (Player Core 150)
### Eldritch Archer Dedication  FEAT 6

## Archetype Dedication Magical

Prerequisites expert in at least one weapon from the
bow or crossbow weapon group
You channel powerful magic with your archery,
allowing you to deliver potent spells through
the tip of an arrow rather than the more
mundane flick of the wrist or whatever
other gestures are usually used. If you
don’t already cast spells from spell
slots, you learn to cast spontaneous
spells and gain the Cast a Spell
activity. You gain a spell repertoire
with one cantrip of your choice, from
a tradition of your choice. You choose a
common cantrip or other cantrip to which
you have access. This cantrip must require
a spell attack roll and come from your chosen
tradition. You’re trained in spell attack modifier
and spell DC. Your key spellcasting attribute for
these spells is Charisma.
Regardless of whether you can already cast spells
or gained the ability from this dedication, you gain
the Eldritch Shot activity.
Eldritch Shot [three-actions] Requirements You are
wielding a bow or a loaded crossbow; Effect
You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast
and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the
spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into
the bow you’re wielding. Make a Strike with that
bow. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using
your attack roll result to determine the effects
of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as
two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but
you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve
completed the Eldritch Shot.
### Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication

You gain the basic spellcasting benefits (page 173). Each time
you gain a spell slot of a new level from this archetype, add a
spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire, either a
common spell of your chosen tradition or another spell of that
tradition you have learned or discovered.
### Enchanting Shot [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Emotion Magical Mental

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your
ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.
Make a bow or crossbow Strike. On a hit, the target takes an
additional 2d6 mental damage. On a critical hit, the target
also becomes stunned 1. The mental damage increases to 3d6
if your weapon has a greater striking rune, or to 4d6 if your
weapon has a major striking rune.

## Magic Ammunition Feat 8


## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
You imbue your ammunition with raw and potent magic,
transforming it to suit your needs in any situation. When
you select this feat, choose three types of common magical
ammunition of 4th level or lower from GM Core (pages 255-
256) or this book (pages 301-302). Your GM might allow
you to choose from other types of magical ammunition
of an appropriate level, such as uncommon ammunition,
or ammunition from other books. You gain the Transform
Ammunition action.
Transform Ammunition [free-action] (magical) Frequency once per
round; Effect You transform a non-magical arrow or bolt
on your person into a piece of magical ammunition of one
type you chose for the Magic Ammunition feat. You must
shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the
magic dissipates. If the ammunition has an Activate entry,
you still need to spend the required actions to activate the
ammunition before shooting it. You can choose a type of
magical ammunition that is typically not available to the
type of ammunition you’re using—for example, you can
use climbing bolt on an arrow, even though that magical
ammunition is normally only found on bolts.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you
do, select three additional types of magical ammunition as
described above.
### Precious Ammunition [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
You have learned to mimic the power that lies between
magic and material. You enchant a piece of ammunition on
your person with the magical essence of a precious material,
allowing you to leverage certain creatures’ weaknesses.
Choose cold iron or silver; if you shoot the arrow or bolt
before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At
14th level, add adamantine to the list of materials you can
choose from.
### Eldritch Reload [free-action] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Requirements Your last action this turn was to make an
Eldritch Shot, Cast a Spell from a spell slot, or activate a
piece of magical ammunition.
You integrate your talent for magic into your use of reloading
weapons. You Interact to reload a weapon you are wielding.
### Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting  FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting
You learn additional eldritch archer magic. You gain the expert
spellcasting benefits (page 173).
### Homing Shot [one-action] FEAT 14

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles
to reach your target. Make a bow or crossbow Strike against
a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target,
even going around corners. You ignore the target’s concealed
condition and all cover.
### Incorporeal Shot [one-action] FEAT 16

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create
a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but
your target. Make a bow or crossbow Strike against a foe
who is observed or hidden to you (but not undetected). The
ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing
through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though
magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the
concealed condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance
bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit
creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike’s damage
can’t be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a nonmagical
shield.
### Fatal Shot [three-actions] FEAT 18

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a
single potent hit. Make a bow or crossbow Strike. On a hit, you
deal an additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the
target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against
the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be immediately slain;
this save has the death and incapacitation traits.
### Master Eldritch Archer Spellcasting  FEAT 18

## Archetype

Prerequisites Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting
You gain the master spellcasting benefits (page 173).

199

Familiar Master
From the wise owl perched on the wizard’s shoulder to
the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own
reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist’s lab
to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief’s
cell, familiars have always served. Yours serves better
than most. This is often due to an unusually strong
connection or rigorous intentional training. Regardless
of the method, the extraordinary qualities of your
familiar are undeniable.
You and your familiar are a team in and of
yourselves. In a tough situation, you know you have
each other’s back, and you are nigh inseparable. Some
familiar masters, however, choose to keep familiars for
only a short period. They will keep their ally for a time,
then release them and forge a new bond. They form
strong connections quickly and attract new familiars
everywhere they go. This behavior is less common
but is often done out of a high level of respect for the
independence of both the adventurer and the familiar,
or a strong connection to the ebb and flow of life and
the cycle of change that touches all things. You are
among these masters and can decide which practice
best suits you.
Additional Feats: 4th Enhanced Familiar (page 153)
### Familiar Master Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might
have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as
meditating under the moon until something crept out of the
forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as
rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued
in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the
end. You gain a familiar (Player Core 212). If you already have a
familiar, you gain the Enhanced Familiar feat (page 153).

## Familiar Mascot Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication
When selecting master abilities, you can choose an ally to
benefit from any specific master ability. Each master ability
can benefit only a single character, and you can select a specific
master ability only once unless the ability says otherwise.
### Familiar Conduit [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Concentrate Spellshape

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication, able to cast spells
Requirements You have line of effect to your familiar.
Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the
hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for
your magic. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that
has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.

## Improved Familiar Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication
You find it easy to attract a powerful and unusual familiar
to your side. The number of abilities required to make your
familiar a specific familiar (page 170) is two lower than normal.

## Mutable Familiar Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication
Your familiar’s supernatural spirit has outgrown its corporeal
body. You can conduct a special 10-minute exploration
activity to reselect certain familiar abilities, switching one or
more of the following abilities for other abilities on this list:
amphibious, burrower, climber, darkvision, fast movement,
manual dexterity, resistance, and scent. You can reselect only
familiar abilities you would normally be able to reselect each
day, not required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can’t
remove an ability that is required for another ability your
familiar has (for instance, you can’t remove manual dexterity if
the familiar has item delivery).

## Incredible Familiar Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Enhanced Familiar
Your familiar is infused with even more magic than other
familiars. You can select six familiar or master abilities each
day, instead of four.

Gladiator
The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat
drive you to become the best—and the fame isn’t bad
either. You always do your best work under the fervent
gaze of spectators, and by work, you of course mean
violence.

## Gladiator Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites Impressive Performance
You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment.
You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Gladiatorial
Lore. If you were already trained in Gladiatorial Lore, you also
become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.
At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators,
you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character
level for 1 minute and you can roll Performance for
your initiative. If there are sapient creatures observing
a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither
engaged in the combat themselves nor directly assisting
any participants, the combatants have spectators. The
GM is the final arbiter of whether or not a combat has
spectators.

## Fancy Moves Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication, expert in
Performance
You show off your fighting style to discourage your foes.
You can use Performance to Demoralize.
### Play To The Crowd [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype Concentrate

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication
Trigger You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a combat
encounter with spectators.
You show off for the crowd. Attempt a Performance check;
the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard
DC for your level or the DC to Make an Impression on the
spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of
the following benefits to gain; on a critical success, choose
two benefits:
- A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your
character level. These last for 1 minute.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your
next turn.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before
the end of your next turn.

## Stage Fighting Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication
You pull punches to give a better show. You don’t take the
usual –2 circumstance penalty when making a nonlethal
attack with a weapon or unarmed attack that doesn’t have the
nonlethal trait.
### Performative Weapons Training  FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication
You’re skilled with flashy weapons and can use them to great
effect. You have familiarity with the bo staff, dueling cape
(Player Core 288), spiked chain, sword cane, trident, war flail,
and whip. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat these
as simple weapons. The GM may add other martial weapons
to this list as appropriate for the world or region you are
playing in.
Whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons,
you get its critical specialization effect.
### Call Your Shot  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Play to the Crowd
When you successfully Play to the Crowd, add the
following to the list of benefits you can choose from:
- A creature you can see within 30
feet becomes frightened 2. This
effect has the emotion, fear, mental,
and visual traits.

201

Herbalist
The plants around you can provide more remedies than
the finest hospital or temple, and you are skilled in
their use. Nature always provides to those who know
how to look, and you have always had a talent for
seeing these gifts before you. You can put it to good
use, healing those around you with nothing more than
what the world provides.

## Herbalist Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Nature, Natural Medicine
You can create natural remedies. You gain the advanced
alchemy benefits (page 174). You can use advanced alchemy
to create 4 alchemical consumables with the healing trait,
though the number is reduced by 2 if you didn’t make your
daily preparations in the wilderness. These consumables are
called your herbal items. You remember herbal item formulas
and don’t need a formula book for them.
You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead
of Crafting to Craft alchemical consumables with the healing
trait. You don’t need to be trained in Crafting to do so, and you
can use healer’s tools instead of alchemist’s tools.

## Fresh Ingredients Feat 2


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication
It is amazing the difference fresh herbs can make. When
using Natural Medicine to Treat Wounds, you gain the +2
circumstance bonus from having fresh ingredients, even if not
in wilderness. If you do this in the wilderness, you gain a +4
circumstance bonus instead.

## Poultice Preparation Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication
When you create an elixir as an herbal item, you can prepare
it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but
remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir trait.
You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand.
When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item’s
normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate
flat check to recover from a single source of persistent
acid, bleed, or fire damage, with the DC reduction from
appropriate assistance.

## Advanced Herbalism Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, expert in Nature
Your herbalist talents continue to grow with use and you
have become potent at making even more remedies from less.
You can create up to 6 herbal items per day with advanced
alchemy.
Special At 10th level or higher, you can select this feat a
second time to increase the number to 8.

## Endemic Herbs Feat 6


## Additive Archetype

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, trained in Survival
The herbal items you create use medicinal plants endemic to
your location. When a creature consumes one of your herbal
items, that creature gains the benefit matching the location
where you created that item. If the benefit is not immediate, it
lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated.
- Aquatic Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.
- Arctic For 1 hour, treat environmental cold effects as if
they were one step less severe.
- Desert For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if
they were one step less severe.
- Forest Gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against
disease and poison effects.
- Mountain Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.
- Plains Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves.
- Swamp Remove one source of persistent bleed damage.
- Underground Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception.

Linguist
Whether you study to further your own ambitions or
simply out of fascination with the intricacies of language,
your way with words is unparalleled.

## Linguist Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites You speak at least three languages.
You have studied languages and their development. You
become trained in Society; if you were already trained in
Society, you instead become an expert in Society. You gain the
Multilingual skill feat twice.

## Multilingual Cipher Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Society
You use multiple languages to create and break codes. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Decipher Writing. If another
creature attempts to Decipher Writing you encoded, they take
a –2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages
you used when you created the writing.

## Phonetic Training Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Society
You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy
even if you don’t understand their meaning, and you can write
them down in a phonetic script that allows you or
another creature with Phonetic Training to read
it later. Even if the words are in a language with
sounds you can’t pronounce, you can faithfully
transcribe them. Memorizing long sequences of
words remains just as difficult as it is normally.
### Spot Translate [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype Auditory Linguistic

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Trigger Another creature within 60
feet uses a linguistic effect in a
language you understand.
You bridge a language gap, repeating
the message in a different language
that you know. Choose a language
you understand to repeat the
message in. The linguistic effect
counts as both languages, rather than
only the language the triggering
creature is using, potentially
allowing it to affect a wider range
of creatures. As normal, you can
translate normal speech without
Spot Translate and without using a
reaction, but this reaction allows you
to apply the benefits of translation to
spells and actions such as command
or Demoralize.

## Analyze Idiolect Feat 6


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Deception and
Society
You break down a specific individual’s idiolect, memorizing
their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with
someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt
to Impersonate that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance
bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense
character study required, if you Analyze Idiolect again, it
replaces any previous idiolect you memorized.

## Read Shibboleths Feat 7


## Archetype Linguistic Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, master in Society
All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If
you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their
regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal
cues provide you with a minor fact about their social
environment, such as their hometown or certain groups
they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being
deceptive about their social environment, such as a
commoner pretending to be a noble, they secretly attempt a
Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your
Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with
their assumed identity on a success.
Once you’ve gleaned one or more true minor facts about
a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms
into your speech to present yourself in a way
that they find familiar. This grants you a +1
circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and
Deception checks with them.

## Crude Communication Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Even if you don’t speak a creature’s language,
you can rely on inflection, root words, and
body language to infer rudimentary
meaning. If you interact with a creature
for at least 10 minutes and that
creature can speak a language, the
GM rolls a secret Society check for
you, with a DC appropriate for the
language’s rarity. On a success, you
understand the gist of the meaning and
can communicate basic concepts back to the
creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or
communicate incorrect concepts. If you’re
legendary in Society, you can communicate
instantly without needing to attempt a
Society check; even if you didn’t know
the medium of communication the creature
uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you
intuit this information as soon as they try to
communicate.

203

Marshal
Marshals are leaders, first and foremost. Marshals can
come from any class or background, though they all share
a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater
good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front,
sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions
and encouragements from the rear while providing allied
spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their
preferred method of combat, marshals’ ability to bring
the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any
group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies
as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear
both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in
battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated.
Such tactics are often seen as more practical than cruel,
and the results speak for themselves. Quick action and
the necessity to fight drive these leaders and their allies
forward into the fray of battle. Regardless of what kind
of marshal you wish to become, you will lead your allies
to glory and victory.
While many see marshals as traditionally warriors
of martial prowess, anyone could make for a potent
marshal. Not every such leader charges into the thick of
battle. While doing so may inspire bravery in desperate
times, many leaders lead from the safety of the back lines.
Spellcaster marshals often lead in this manner. In their
mind, the practicality of their own survival outweighs
the powerful yet fleeting courage a charge inspires. After
all, more battles await in the future, and their skills may
very well be needed again.
Additional Feats: 8th Reactive Strike (page 80)

## Marshal Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in martial weapons and either Diplomacy
or Intimidation
You’ve combined your social skills and combat training to
become a talented combat leader. Choose Diplomacy or
Intimidation. You become trained in that skill or become an
expert if you were already trained in it.
In addition, while you’re conscious, you’re surrounded by
a marshal’s aura in a 15-foot emanation. Your aura has the
emotion, mental, and visual traits and grants you and allies in
the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against fear.
### Dread Marshal Stance [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Stance

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in
Intimidation
Putting on a grim face for the battle ahead, you
encourage your allies to strike fear into their foes
with vicious attacks. When you use this action,
attempt an Intimidation check. The DC is usually an
easy DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different
DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the
result of your check.
Success Your marshal’s aura grants you and your allies in
the aura a +1 status bonus to damage rolls. When you or
an ally in the aura critically hit an enemy with a Strike, that
enemy is frightened 1. If you’re wielding a weapon that has
more than one damage die (typically due to a striking rune),
you can have the status bonus equal the weapon’s number
of damage dice instead of +1.
Failure You fail to enter the stance.
Critical Failure You fail to enter the stance and can’t take this
action again for 1 minute.
### Inspiring Marshal Stance [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Stance

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in Diplomacy
You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in
battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend
this action, attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually an
easy DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC
based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result
of your check.

Success Your marshal’s aura grants you and allies a +1 status
bonus to attack rolls and saves against mental effects.
Failure You fail to enter the stance.
Critical Failure You fail to enter the stance and can’t take this
action again for 1 minute.
SNAP OUT OF IT! [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Auditory Emotion Mental

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You give a quick shout, hoping to shake the fog clouding
your ally’s thoughts. Choose one target ally in your marshal’s
aura who is affected by a mental effect that allowed a Will
save and has a duration of no longer than 1 minute. That ally
can immediately attempt a Will save with a +1 circumstance
bonus against the effect’s DC, ending the effect on a success.
This can’t end the effect for any creatures other than your
target ally. Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is
temporarily immune to Snap Out of It! for 10 minutes.
STEEL YOURSELF! [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Auditory Emotion Mental

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You encourage an ally to toughen up, giving them a fighting
chance. Choose one ally in your marshal’s aura. The ally gains
temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier and a +2
circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves. Both benefits last until
the start of your next turn.
### Cadence Call [one-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype Auditory Flourish

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
Frequency once per minute
You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more
efficient rhythm. Each willing ally in your marshal’s aura is
quickened until the end of their next turn, and they can use
the extra action only to Stride. If an ally uses this extra action,
at the end of its turn that ally becomes slowed 1 until the end
of its following turn.
### Rallying Charge [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Archetype Visual

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
Your fearless charge into battle reinvigorates your allies to
carry on the fight. You Stride up to your Speed and make a
melee Strike. If your Strike hits and damages an enemy, each
ally within 60 feet who saw you hit gains temporary Hit Points
equal to your Charisma modifier. These temporary Hit Points
last until the start of your next turn.
### Back To Back  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You excel at watching your allies’ backs and helping them
watch yours. Any ally adjacent to you can’t be off-guard due
to flanking unless you’re also flanked. Similarly, while you’re
adjacent to at least one ally, you can’t be off-guard due to
flanking unless at least one ally you’re adjacent to is flanked
as well.
TO BATTLE! [one-action] OR [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Auditory Flourish

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
With a resounding cry, you rally your ally to take the offensive.
Choose one ally in your marshal’s aura who has a reaction
available. If you spend 1 action, that ally can use their reaction
to immediately Stride. If you spend 2 actions, that ally can use
their reaction to immediately Strike.
### Topple Foe [reaction] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in Athletics
Trigger An ally succeeds at a melee Strike against an enemy
you are both adjacent to.
You take advantage of the opening created by your ally to tip
your foe off their feet. Attempt an Athletics check to Trip the
target of the triggering attack.
### Coordinated Charge [two-actions] FEAT 12

## Archetype Flourish Visual

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow.
You Stride up to your Speed and make a melee Strike. If your
Strike hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet
who saw you hit can use a reaction to Stride, but they each
must end their Stride closer to the creature you hit than where
they started.

## Tactical Cadence Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cadence Call
Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions
allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively, even in
desperate situations. When you grant allies the quickened
condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action
to either Stride or Strike, and they aren’t slowed 1 on their
following turn if they use the extra action.
### Target Of Opportunity [reaction] FEAT 14

## Archetype Manipulate

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
Trigger An ally succeeds at a ranged Strike against an
opponent in your weapon’s first range increment.
Requirements You have a ranged or thrown weapon in hand.
You capitalize on your ally’s attack and use the opportunity
to secure a blow of your own, adding to the oncoming
barrage. Make a ranged Strike with a –2 penalty against
the opponent targeted by the triggering attack. This Strike
doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your
multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike. If this
Strike is successful, combine the damage from the attack
with the damage from your ally’s attack for the purpose of
resistances and weaknesses.

205

Martial Artist
You have trained in the martial arts, making your
unarmed strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor
enlightenment, and you don’t view this training as some
greater path to wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist
striking flesh, the hand turning aside the blade, and the
devastating kick taking your enemy down. Your training
is focused and practical, and since you have turned
every part of your body into a weapon, you never find
yourself without one. While you might have learned
your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training
the body, you might just as easily have learned them in
street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with
intense athleticism for a deadly combination.
Regardless of your origins, your path is one of iron,
transforming your body into a deadly weapon. The
techniques available are many, but the results are all the
same. Whether you attack with your fist, fang, or foot,
your prowess is undeniable. Many martial artists seek
to master a stance to put form to their flurry of attacks.
Such techniques allow one to channel their strength.
However, some prefer freedom in form and reject stances
altogether. You may find your own style or master one of
the forms used by legendary martial artists.
Additional Feats: 4th Crane Stance (page 118),
Dragon Stance (page 118), Mountain Stance (page 118),
Stumbling Stance (page 119), Tiger Stance (page 119),
Wolf Stance (page 119); 8th Crane Flutter (page 121),
Dragon Roar (page 121), Mountain Stronghold (page
122), Tiger Slash (page 122), Wolf Drag (page 123); 16th
Mountain Quake (page 126)
### Martial Artist Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons and
can deliver devastatingly powerful blows with them. The
damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes 1d6
instead of 1d4. You don’t take the –2 circumstance penalty
for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed
attacks.
### Follow-Up Strike [one-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
Requirements Your last action was a missed Strike with a
melee unarmed attack.
You have trained rigorously to use all parts of your body
as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can
usually continue the attack with a different body part
and still deal damage. Make another Strike with a melee
unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as
the missed Strike, if any.
### Grievous Blow [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
You know how to deliver focused, powerful blows that bypass
your enemies’ resistances. Make an unarmed melee Strike. If
this Strike hits, it deals two additional weapon damage dice
and ignores an amount of resistance to physical damage (or
to a specific physical damage type) equal to your level. This
Strike counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple
attack penalty.
If you are at least 18th level, increase the additional
damage to three weapon damage dice.
### Path Of Iron [three-actions] FEAT 14

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
Frequency once per minute
With a burst of effort and speed, you weave a nimble
path through your many enemies, striking each in turn
as you move past them. You Stride; this movement
doesn’t trigger reactions. You can attempt a melee
Strike up to three times at any point during your
movement, each against a different enemy.
Each attack counts toward your multiple
attack penalty, but your multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until you
have made all your attacks.

Mauler
You shove your way through legions of foes, knock
enemies on all sides to the ground, and deal massive
blows to anyone or anything that comes near. You know
that when it comes to taking down an enemy, it never
hurts to have a bigger weapon.
Additional Feats: 4th Slam Down (Player Core 143),
Vicious Swing (Player Core 141); 12th Crashing Slam
(Player Core 147); 14th Brutal Finish (Player Core 148),
Unbalancing Sweep (page 83)

## Mauler Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites Strength 14
You specialize in melee weapons that require two hands. You have
familiarity with all melee weapons that require two hands to wield
or have the two-hand trait. For the purposes of proficiency, you
treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons
and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.
If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain
access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.
### Clear The Way [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing,
shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to Shove up
to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate Athletics
check for each target and ignoring the requirement that
you have a hand free. Then Stride up to half your Speed.
This movement doesn’t trigger reactions from any of the
creatures you successfully Shoved. Each attack counts
toward your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase
your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
### Shoving Sweep [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication, expert in Athletics
Trigger An enemy within your reach leaves a square during a
move action it’s using.
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
You swing your weapon at your foe, rebuffing them back. You
attempt to Shove the triggering creature, ignoring the requirement
that you have a hand free. Unless you critically succeed at your
check, the creature continues its movement after the Shove.
### Hammer Quake [three-actions] FEAT 14

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a non-finesse melee
weapon in two hands.
You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby
creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach,
including your own space. If there’s an enemy in the chosen
square, you can Strike that enemy with your two-handed
weapon. Regardless of whether you attempted a Strike,
you then attempt to Trip every enemy in the chosen square
plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip’s
requirement that you have a hand free.
Hammer Quake counts as three attacks toward your
multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until
after you’ve made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.
### Avalanche Strike [three-actions] FEAT 16

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike with
your two-handed weapon against each enemy within its
melee reach. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack
penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have made
all your attacks.

207

Medic
You’ve studied countless techniques for providing
medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer.
While many healers happily practice the art of medicine
in the safety and serenity of stationary buildings, few
are in more dire need of medicinal aid than adventurers.
Such an occupation comes with frequent injuries that
need constant attention. Few parties would ever turn
down help from a practicing medic. In fact, the need
for medicine is so great that many medics started as
adventurers and took up medicine as a necessity. While
patching up injuries is the most common practice of
medics, they are also invaluable for their ability to
help fight diseases and ailments inflicted by all kinds of
creatures and traps. The adaptability and utility of the
medic are undeniable. Whether you studied medicine for
most of your life or picked it up on the road, you are
who people turn to for aid.

## Medic Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Medicine, Battle Medicine
You become an expert in Medicine. When you succeed
with Battle Medicine or Treat Wounds, the target gains a
circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points they regain
equal to 5 HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40.
Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature
that’s temporarily immune due to having already been treated
with Battle Medicine. If you’re a master in Medicine, you can
do so once per hour.
DOCTOR’S VISITATION [one-action] OR [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Medic Dedication
You move to provide immediate care to those who need it.
You Stride, then use Battle Medicine or Treat Poison. You can
spend 2 actions for Doctor’s Visitation to instead Stride and
then use either Administer First Aid or Treat Condition (if you
have that feat).
### Treat Condition [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Healing Manipulate Skill

Prerequisites Medic Dedication
Requirements You are holding healer’s tools, or you are
wearing them and have a hand free.
You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the
clumsy, enfeebled, or sickened condition. If a creature has
multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a
counteract check against the condition using your Medicine
modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition’s source
to determine the DC. You can’t treat a condition that came
from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have
Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases
by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under
certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a
holy character gains from carrying a weapon with the unholy
rune) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.
Critical Success Reduce the condition value by 2.
Success Reduce the condition value by 1.
Critical Failure Increase the condition value by 1.

## Holistic Care Feat 6


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy, Treat Condition
You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add frightened,
stupefied, and stunned to the list of conditions you can reduce
with Treat Condition. If the stunned condition has a duration
instead of a value, you can’t use Treat Condition to reduce it.
### Resuscitate [three-actions] FEAT 16

## Archetype Healing Manipulate

Prerequisites Medic Dedication, legendary in Medicine
Requirements You are holding healer’s tools or are wearing
them and have a hand free.
You resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to
revive a dead creature who has been dead for no more than 3
rounds and whose body is mostly intact. If you succeed, the
target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it
still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased
by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn’t wounded before dying).
Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune
to Resuscitate for 1 day.

Pirate
You live a life of freedom, taking by force and
intimidation all that you could possibly desire. You
may be a privateer, raiding and plundering on behalf
of a particular nation or another authority, or you
may answer to no one but your own capricious whims.
Either way, you rely on intimidation, wits, and combat
prowess to take what you want from those you deem
less deserving.
Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers,
and many pirates have the swashbuckler class (page 158)
or archetype (page 182). Much like a swashbuckler’s
daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often showy
feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain panache.
For example, if you have the panache class feature,
Boarding Assault gains the bravado trait.
Additional Feats: 4th Antagonize (page 165), You’re
Next (page 164)

## Pirate Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to
plunder and great adventures to embark on. You gain the
Additional Lore general feat for Sailing Lore or for a specific
coastal city you have a connection to (such as Port Peril Lore).
You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground
caused by unstable ground (such as the deck of a ship).
Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action.
Boarding Assault [two-actions] (flourish) Either Stride twice or attempt
an Acrobatics check (DC determined by the GM, but usually
DC 20) to swing up to twice your Speed on a rope or similar
object, then Strike. If you boarded or disembarked from a
boat or similar vehicle during this movement, the Strike
deals one additional weapon damage die.
### Pirate Combat Training  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Pirate Dedication
You’re particularly skilled at wielding the weapons used
traditionally by pirates. You gain either the Combat Climber
or Underwater Marauder skill feat, even if you do not
meet its prerequisites. You have familiarity with the
following weapons: hatchet, rapier, scimitar, and
whip—for the purposes of proficiency, you treat
any of these weapons as simple weapons.
Your GM may add additional martial
weapons to this list as appropriate for
your world or region.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## Rope Runner Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Pirate Dedication, trained in Acrobatics and
Athletics
You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as
on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only when
climbing ropes and similar objects. Whenever you succeed at
an Athletics check to Climb or an Acrobatics check to Balance,
you get a critical success instead. You aren’t off-guard while
Climbing or Balancing on a rope or similar object.
### Walk The Plank [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Pirate Dedication
You frighten a foe into moving where you want them,
traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to
Demoralize an opponent. On a success, in addition to the
normal effects, you can also force the target to Stride up to
its Speed immediately. You choose the path the target takes,
but you can’t force it to move into an obviously harmful space
(such as into hazardous terrain or a space where it would fall)
unless your check was a critical success. As normal for forced
movement, this movement doesn’t trigger reactions. The
target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank
for 10 minutes.

209

Poisoner
People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the
insidious power of nature. The bite of a certain serpent
makes the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone,
suitably powdered, induces powerful hallucinations
and delirium. The sap of a rare tree inflicts such agony
that death seems preferable. The deadly medicines
of nature have been molded to create concoctions
capable of both killing and debilitating. Neither option
is pleasant for the unfortunate recipient. You are a
student of such dark wonders, making you a dangerous
foe indeed.
Additional Feats: 4th Blowgun Poisoner (page 63),
Poison Resistance (Player Core 129); 6th Poison
Weapon (Player Core 171), Tenacious Toxins (page
65); 8th Sticky Poison (page 66); 10th Improved Poison
Weapon (Player Core 173), Pinpoint Poisoner (page 67)

## Poisoner Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You make a point of always having a few toxins near at
hand—you never know when some arsenic or the like might
prove useful. You gain the advanced alchemy benefits
(page 58). You can use advanced alchemy to create four
alchemical poison consumables each day. You remember
alchemical poison formulas and don’t need a formula book
for them.
POISONER’S TWIST [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication, trained in Medicine
Requirements Your last action was a successful melee Strike
that dealt damage against a target afflicted by a poison, and
you know which poison.
Poisons attack specific parts of the body—one venom might
target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while
another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take
advantage of such weaknesses. You deal 1d6 damage of the
required Strike’s damage type and 1d6 poison damage to the
target. If you’re at least 18th level, you deal 2d6 damage of
each type.

## Advanced Poisoncraft Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
You can create up to 6 poisons per day with advanced alchemy.
Special At 10th level or higher, you can select this feat a
second time to increase the number to 8.

## Poison Coat Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines,
and just brushing against them can prove deadly. You
expend a contact or injury poison and spend 10 minutes
brushing that poison onto your clothing or weaving sharp,
poisoned needles into the garment’s fabric. You can have
only one poison suffused into your clothing at a time. You
can use the Once Bitten reaction while you have a poison
suffused in this way.
Once Bitten [reaction] Trigger A creature adjacent to you hits you
with a melee unarmed Strike; Requirements You have
prepared your clothing to poison attackers; Effect The
triggering creature is exposed to the suffused poison, and
the poison becomes inert.
### Acquired Tolerance [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype Fortune

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
Trigger You fail a save against a poison.
A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can
help the body build up resistance against a more deadly
dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the second
result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue
to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you
can’t use it against a different type of poison until after you
make your next daily preparations. For instance, if you used
the reaction on a save against giant scorpion venom, you
could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it
came from a different source, but you couldn’t use it against
wyvern poison.

## Chemical Contagion Feat 18


## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
Your injury poisons can spray onto creatures. You gain the
toxicologist alchemist’s greater field discovery (page 62).

Ritualist
While some learn the art of ritual casting through
rigorous study, other gifted individuals may find that
a combination of natural talent and luck grants them
surprising skill at performing rituals, whether they
want that power or not. Undertaking rituals always
carries an element of risk, but the potential rewards
are undeniable and difficult to resist. You have learned
how to perform rituals and can decide how to best use
their powerful benefits.

## Ritualist Dedication Feat 4


## Uncommon Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all checks to perform a
ritual. You learn two uncommon rituals of 2nd rank or lower.
You must meet all prerequisites to be the primary caster of a
ritual to select it, and you can’t teach it to anyone else or allow
someone else to serve as primary caster unless they know the
ritual as well.
At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn two
more rituals with the same restrictions and with a maximum
rank of half that level.

## Flexible Ritualist Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you
cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters
by 1. When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for
the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check
normally performed by that secondary caster. You can’t
replace a secondary caster who is the target of the spell (as
in the atone ritual).

## Resourceful Ritualist Feat 6


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can cast difficult rituals that might otherwise be just
beyond your skill. You can attempt checks to cast a ritual
that requires expert proficiency if you are trained, master
proficiency if you are an expert, or legendary proficiency
if you are a master.

## Efficient Rituals Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can perform particularly extensive rituals in less time.
If the ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast it
in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast it in half
the number of days, rounded up.
At 14th level, if a ritual has a casting time measured in
days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this
results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual
between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.

## Assured Ritualist Feat 10


## Archetype Fortune

Prerequisites Flexible Ritualist
You can cover for a secondary caster’s error. If you are the
primary caster, after all the secondary checks are rolled, you
can choose one check that was a failure or critical failure, and
improve the result to one degree of success better than what
the secondary caster rolled.

## Enterprising Ritualist Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
Elegant and expensive components are no replacement for
your skill and practice at ritual casting. If a ritual has a Cost
entry that has a value in gp, reduce the amount you need to
spend by 10%. If you critically succeed at the primary check
for a ritual, the gp value of components the ritual consumes is
reduced by the same amount. For example, using resurrect to
bring back a 14th-level creature normally costs 1,050 gp, but
would cost you only 945 gp; and if you critically succeeded
at the primary Religion check, you would spend only 840 gp.

211

Scout
You’re an expert in espionage and reconnaissance,
able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather
intelligence, sneak through enemy lines and report
back to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively
take down your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of
travel for you and your companions and keep you all
alert to approaching danger. It’s not just enemies that
you scout out; you also survey the land. You’re able
to discover the easiest routes as safely as possible and
remain watchful while moving with speed and subtlety.
The responsibility of the party’s safe passage depends
on you performing your scouting duties with constant
and consistent effort. You take pride in your vigilance,
and your allies trust your guidance to ensure the safety
of everyone traveling.
Additional Feats: 12th Camouflage (Player Core 161)

## Scout Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Stealth and Survival
You are a highly skilled scout, capable of guiding your allies,
detecting imminent threats, and avoiding the attention of
dangerous enemies. You can perform the Scout exploration
activity at the same time as the Avoid Notice exploration
activity. The bonus to initiative you grant when you Scout is
+2 instead of +1.
SCOUT’S CHARGE [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your
opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. Stride, Feint
against that opponent, and then make a Strike against it. For
your Feint, you can attempt a Stealth check instead of the
Deception check that’s usually required, using the terrain
around you to surprise your foe.

## Terrain Scout Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You have mastered movement in many different environments.
You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat (Player Core 263) twice,
choosing a different terrain each time. If you Avoid Notice
while exploring and any allies use Follow the Expert to follow
you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the
benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have.
### Fleeting Shadow [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You’re able to quickly disappear and then move about
without drawing the attention of your enemies. You Hide,
then Sneak twice.

## Scout’S Speed Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You move faster, especially when traveling, allowing you
to scout out ahead and report back without slowing your
allies. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. When
calculating your travel speed, this increases to a +20-foot
status bonus.
SCOUT’S POUNCE [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
Requirements You are hidden from or undetected by all of
your opponents, and you aren’t within 10 feet of any enemy.
You leap from the shadows to strike at your foes. Stride up to
your Speed, then Strike twice. If you were hidden or unnoticed
by the target of these Strikes, the target is off-guard against
both attacks. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally for
both attacks.

Scroll Trickster
Magic has been written down in myriad forms for a
very long time. From the classic rolled parchment to
strings tied with a hundred intricate knots, from baked
clay tablets covered with incisions to bound collections
of bamboo slips, magic is everywhere. You just need to
know how to read it. You have studied the art of reading
magical scrolls of various kinds. The language of magic
is yours to use and manipulate, however unstable and
archaic such writing tends to be.
### Scroll Trickster Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You’ve studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a
comprehensive education in a formal setting or the sort of
education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and
try not to explode anything you didn’t mean to explode. You
gain the Trick Magic Item feat (Player Core 264), and you gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you
roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that’s a scroll, you
get a failure instead.
### Basic Scroll Cache  FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication
You have a vast and overflowing collection of scroll scraps,
riddled with errors and misspellings and leaking energy like a
sieve. With enough care, you can coax these scroll scraps into
functioning—briefly. Each day during your daily preparations,
you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-rank
spell. The spell must be a common spell, a spell to which you
have access, or a spell you are able to cast, and you must be
trained in the skill corresponding to at least one of the spell’s
traditions. You can use Learn a Spell to add spells to those you
can use with this feat, even if you aren’t a spellcaster. This
scroll is an unstable, temporary item (page 174) and loses its
magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you
haven’t already used it. This temporary scroll can’t be used to
Learn the Spell.
At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a
2nd-rank spell.
### Skim Scroll [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication
You can activate the magic of a scroll with a cursory read as
you draw it from your belt. You Interact to draw a scroll, then
use Trick Magic Item on the scroll.
### Expert Scroll Cache  FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Basic Scroll Cache
Your scroll collection has vastly grown, both in size and
potency. In addition to your daily scrolls from Basic Scroll
Cache, add a scroll with a 3rd-rank spell. At 14th level, add a
scroll with a 4th-rank spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a
5th-rank spell.
### Master Scroll Cache  FEAT 18

## Archetype

Prerequisites Expert Scroll Cache
Your scroll collection is incredible, brimming with eldritch
power, and you can prepare far more of them than an ordinary
scroll trickster. In addition to your daily scrolls from the Basic
and Expert Scroll Caches, add a single scroll with a 6th-rank
spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-rank spell.

213

Scrounger
You have spent countless hours disassembling and
rebuilding complex items to learn how they work, giving
you the skill to create just about anything from the
most unlikely materials. While your improvised items
don’t last long, they tend to be just what you need in
a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might
be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you
that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate
situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and
the mundane objects around you are the pieces you
use to improvise your own solutions. Few are more
resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and
widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about
any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable
while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what’s
in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared
for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such
as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be
needed, provided your constant attempts to break down
and reassemble everything aren’t a bother. You never
know what you may need in the future.

## Scrounger Dedication Feat 2


## Uncommon Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
While others need specialized tools and a dedicated space,
you have found a way to build just about anything, anywhere.
You can Craft items even without appropriate tools or a
workshop. Additionally, you don’t need a physical formula
book to remember all of your formulas; you pay the same cost
as normal to learn them, but you memorize them all. You gain
the Cobble Together activity.
Cobble Together (exploration) You Craft a temporary item (page
174) out of anything, anywhere, with whatever materials
happen to be on hand, spending only 10 minutes to perform
the initial Crafting check. The temporary item must be one
you’ve memorized or have the formula for, and must be
common, non-magical, half your level or lower, and must be
a weapon, armor, or a non-consumable piece of adventuring
gear (non-consumable adventuring gear appears on page
291 of Player Core). Instead of a single item, you can create
10 pieces of a single type of ammunition. You can create
only the physical item, not any information or magic, so for
example, while you could create a blank journal or one with
random pages, you couldn’t use it as a scholarly journal or
a religious text.
An item you Cobble Together is a shoddy item, but when
creating it you can choose one creature to build it specifically
for. That creature doesn’t take the normal penalty for using
this shoddy item. Your temporary item lasts for 1d4 hours
before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls
the number of hours secretly.

## Reverse Engineering Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication, expert in Crafting
Your nigh-constant tinkering and fiddling with objects means you
are able to reverse engineer items into formulas more effectively
than most. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks
to reverse engineer a formula from an item, and you can attempt
a Crafting check to reverse engineer an item after spending 1 day
of work setting up instead of 2. Additionally, if you get a critical
success on your Crafting check, you can opt to not only create the
formula but also reassemble the original item at the same time,
leaving you with the formula and the item instead of the formula
and raw materials equal to half the item’s value.

## Magical Scrounger Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication, Magical Crafting (Player
Core 258)
You can craft a temporary wondrous item using the magic
scrounged from all around. Once per day, you can Cobble
Together a temporary magic item. The temporary item must
be common, magical, half your level or lower, and be able to
be held, wielded, or worn. Any Craft requirements must be
provided as normal.
You can’t Cobble Together a consumable, a rune, or an item
with runes. If the item must be worn or affixed, removing it
once it’s affixed or donned destroys it.

## Expert Disassembly Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication, master in Crafting
You can apply the same techniques you use to reverse engineer
objects to disable dangerous traps and break apart locks. You
can use Crafting instead of Thievery to Disable a Device or
Pick a Lock.

Sentinel
Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and
as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you
have made it your business to get the most out of your
defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in
the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens,
your solid defenses will safely get you, and hopefully
your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might
be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who
trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor.
On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who
took one too many grievous injuries and decided enough
was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest
plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or
sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel
to increase their survivability. While this is less common,
it’s not less effective. Few will argue against stronger,
heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle
knows, it’s always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall
back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell
than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you
know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won’t
abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough. You
can rely on your armor to see you through whatever
tough fights lie ahead, and the odds always seem better
when you’re protected.

## Sentinel Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

You have trained carefully to maximize the protective
qualities of your armor. You become trained in light armor
and medium armor. If you already were trained in light
armor and medium armor, you gain training in heavy
armor as well. Whenever you gain a class feature that
grants you expert or greater proficiency in any type of
armor (but not unarmored defense), you also gain that
proficiency in the armor types granted to you by this feat.
If you have a class feature that grants you expert proficiency
in unarmored defense and you’re 13th level or higher, you
also become an expert in the armor types granted to you by
this feat.

## Steel Skin Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication, trained in Survival
You wear your armor like a second skin, taking comfort in the
protection it offers. You don’t become fatigued if you sleep
while wearing armor.

## Armor Specialist Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
You have trained hard to optimize your armor’s unique
protective qualities to maximize the materials used in its
creation. You gain the armor specialization effects for all
armors you are proficient with.
### Armored Rebuff [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
Trigger An adjacent enemy critically fails an attack roll to
Strike you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.
Requirements You are wearing medium armor or heavier.
You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back
your foe. Attempt an Athletics check to Shove the triggering
enemy, even if you don’t have a hand free. If you succeed,
you can’t Stride to follow the enemy, as you’re knocking the
enemy back with the rebounded attack, not by physically
moving towards them.

## Mighty Bulwark Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
Thanks to the incredible connection you have forged with
your armor, you can use it to shrug off an extensive array of
dangers. Your bonus from the bulwark armor trait increases
from +3 to +4, and it applies on all Reflex saves, not just
damaging Reflex saves.

215

Snarecrafter
You’re able to take ordinary materials and use them to
create deadly snares—special traps that you can rig up
quickly when the situation demands. While traps might
grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than
weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair.
Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your
choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your
well‑placed snares. Once your foes realize that you
may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their
fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral
them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even
make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them
in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage:
they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps
you’ve deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them,
some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap
right under their foes’ feet. Others have found they
can trigger dangerous snares from a safe distance due
to years of practice. Truly, snare crafters make for a
dangerous foe and handy ally.

## Snarecrafter Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You have studied the art of crafting snares and laying traps,
and few have shown more talent in these arts than you. You
gain the Snare Crafting feat (page 234). When you set a snare,
the DC of any saving throw it requires uses the higher of your
class DC or the snare’s DC. If a snare normally takes 1 minute
to Craft, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions instead.
Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare
four snares from your formula book for quick deployment
(increasing to six snares if you’re a master in Crafting and
eight if you’re legendary). Snares prepared in this way don’t
cost you any resources to Craft.
When you increase your proficiency rank in Crafting to
expert, master, or legendary, add three additional snare
formulas to your formula book. The snares must be of your
level or lower.
Special Rangers can adapt snare crafting techniques to create
snares from natural materials. If you are a ranger, you can
use Survival instead of Crafting for all prerequisites and
functions of feats from this archetype. (This includes using
Survival to Craft a snare.)
### Surprise Snare [three-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Manipulate

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You install one prepared snare for deployment in a space that’s
occupied by an enemy. It must be a snare that normally takes 1
minute or less to Craft. The snare automatically triggers.

## Remote Trigger Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You’ve learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged
hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm
enemies’ snares harmlessly. You can Strike a snare to trigger
it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit.
If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged Strike against the
Crafting DC, triggering the snare only if you hit.

## Giant Snare Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it
more likely for a creature to walk into your snares. When you
prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some
of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-
10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A
giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of
its area, and all its effects apply over the full area.

## Lightning Snares Feat 12


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication, master in Crafting
You can rig a trap with incredible speed. When you create a
snare that normally takes 1 minute to Craft, you can Craft it
using a single Interact action instead.

## Plentiful Snares Feat 12


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You can prepare incredible numbers of snares each day out
of simple ingredients. Double the number of prepared snares
granted by Snarecrafter Dedication.

Talisman Dabbler
The classic idea of magic is that of a hoary wizard,
poring over a crumbling book of spells as years pass. But
magic is so much more than that—it’s thought, will, and
action, and with the right talismans, you can make even
the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges
on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear.
You know how to make and use the perfect talisman
for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They
can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better,
grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even
save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no
more than exploring just how far you can push your
talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You’ve
heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself
mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical
magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages
have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single
object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation
of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked
up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and
the usefulness of talismans is apparent. Take advantage
of every ounce of magic you can manipulate and master
these mystical trinkets.
### Talisman Dabbler Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical
paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal
classroom or been an accumulation of folk magic picked up
over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas
for all common talismans of your level or lower. You
remember talisman formulas and don’t need a formula
book for them.
Additionally, you carry a vast collection of magical
baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each
day during your daily preparations, you can make two
talismans with an item level no higher than half your
level. You must know each talisman’s formula. A talisman
created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic
the next time you make your daily preparations if you
haven’t already used it. Any saving throw DC required
by a temporary talisman you create uses the highest of
your class DC, spell DC, or the talisman’s DC.
Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can (in any
combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the
10-minute span.

## Quick Fix Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some
string. You gain the Rapid Affixture skill feat (page 233), even
if you don’t meet the prerequisites. When you use it, you can
affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of
just one.
You gain the ability to Affix a Talisman as a 3-action activity
from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your Crafting
proficiency.

## Deeper Dabbler Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
With some streamlining to your process and a deeper
collection of talisman materials, you make a greater number of
talismans every day. You can create two additional talismans
during your daily preparations.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th
level or higher.

## Talismanic Sage Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes
the talismans to be suppressed, but when you Affix a
Talisman, you can specially treat one item you’re working on,
allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special
treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item
for this ability.

Vigilante
As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona,
and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal
actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you
adventure and carry out clandestine missions while
keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever
your purpose—fighting crime, inciting rebellion,
sowing chaos—your vigilante identity makes you both
hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject
of gossip. While many adventurers prefer to bask in the
glory or infamy of their actions, you keep that part of
your life a secret. There are various reasons why you
might do this. Perhaps you have something or someone
in your life that you want to protect from the dangers
and threats that your other life. Perhaps you are a
public figure, and your alternate life could draw undue
attention from your community. It could also be that
you don’t like attention and wish to retain the ability
to step away from it all and relax in peace. Regardless
of your reasons, you have a secret identity and will go
to great lengths to keep it secret.
Vigilantes can have many goals and agendas. Some see
them as glory seekers, but more often than not, they are
working towards some lofty goal. Perhaps they are trying
to inspire a people to fight back against their oppressors.
They could be hunting down a crime lord they have a
personal vendetta against. Maybe they seek to rebalance
the wealth of a nation, stealing from the rich to give to
those in need. You are one such vigilante, living a hidden
life so you can fight in secrecy. What will you do to keep
your secret and continue down your path?
Additional Feats: 4th Quick Draw (Player Core 159)

## Vigilante Dedication Feat 2


## Uncommon Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Deception
You have two identities, each with its own name and abilities.
Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while
your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither
of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these
people. If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they
must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against
your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate
action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your
proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with
Impersonate, you don’t have to attempt a Deception check to
interact with someone to conceal your other identity—a check
happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your
other identity.
Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute
and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this
process involves both physical changes such as clothing
and makeup, along with an altered state of mind,
other effects that change your appearance don’t
reduce the time required to change identities.
Your two identities are completely
distinct. Checks to Recall Knowledge
about one of your identities don’t
reveal information about the other unless the
person attempting the check knows both
identities are the same person. Effects that
detect you based on your identity work only
if you are currently in the identity the effect is
trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if
the target didn’t exist.
To maintain the separation between your
identities, some of your abilities have the
vigilante trait. Your class feats and vigilante
feats are associated with your vigilante identity,
and using them while in your social identity may risk
exposing you as a vigilante. If your identity is exposed to
the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to
disguising yourself, but you can spend 1 week of downtime
to create a new social identity.


## Hidden Magic Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication; expert in Arcana, Nature,
Occultism, or Religion
You’ve learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During
your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your
magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this
way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using
detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check
against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.

## Minion Guise Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, animal companion or
familiar, expert in Deception
When you are in your social identity, you can also grant
a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, pet, or
other minion you gained from a class feature or feat. When
changing to your social identity, you also change your minion’s
appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type,
such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising
a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion
to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from
your class features or feats while in this social identity risks
exposing your vigilante identity.

## Safe House Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
You establish a safe house—a secure space in which to hide
your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly
the size of two 10-foot cubes. It’s in a location you have access
to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a
hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects
objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has
the effects of veil of privacy, using your Deception modifier
for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the
counteract rank. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a
week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four
10-foot cubes if you’re an expert in Deception, eight cubes if
you’re a master, and 16 cubes if you’re legendary.

## Social Purview Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity.
Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for.
You gain that archetype’s dedication feat and can select feats
from that archetype, even if you haven’t yet gained enough
feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication
feat. These feats become part of your social identity—for
instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication
feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats
in your social identity doesn’t risk exposing your vigilante
identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put
you at risk for exposure.
### Startling Appearance [one-action] FEAT 6
### Archetype Emotion Fear Mental Vigilante
Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
Requirements You are unnoticed by the target creature.
You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.
Make a Strike against your target. That creature is off-guard
against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target
remains off‑guard for the rest of your turn and is frightened 1
(frightened 2 on a critical hit).

## Quick Change Feat 7


## Archetype

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, master in Deception
You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of
spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so
as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in Deception, you
can perform this change as a single action.

## Subjective Truth Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, master in Deception
Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that
detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of
view of your current identity, you can deceive effects like ring
of truth that reveal lies.

## Many Guises Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, master in Deception
You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever
you change your identity, instead of taking on your social
or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely
ordinary. This identity isn’t a specific individual—rather,
you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any
gender, and from a mundane occupation such as common
laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as
if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your
two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check
against the same Deception DC used for Vigilante Dedication.
Using class or dedication abilities ends this disguise.

## Frightening Appearance Feat 12


## Archetype Vigilante

Prerequisites expert in Intimidation, Startling Appearance
Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders. When
you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to
Demoralize each enemy in a 10-foot emanation you were
unnoticed by before your Strike.

## Stunning Appearance Feat 16


## Archetype Vigilante

Prerequisites Startling Appearance
Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond.
When you use Startling Appearance and your Strike hits an
enemy of your level or lower, the enemy is also stunned 1 on a
hit, or stunned 2 on a critical hit.

219

Viking
To go “a-viking” is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have
spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very
communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally
travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live
aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or,
as they call it, the “whale-road”) to ambush coastal
communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they
charge ashore, plundering and slaying anyone foolish
enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids
is legendary.
Additional Feats: 4th Reactive Shield (Player Core
140); 6th Shielded Stride (Player Core 143); 10th Quick
Shield Block (page 97)

## Viking Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from
their boats at a moment’s notice, charge through the surf, and
take their enemies by storm. You gain the Additional Lore
general feat for Sailing Lore and Warfare Lore.
When using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain
from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition,
if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Swim, you get a
critical success instead.
### Hurling Charge [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a thrown weapon.
You make a ranged Strike with your thrown weapon, Stride,
and then Interact to draw another weapon. This Interact
action doesn’t trigger reactions.
Special If you are raging (page 72) and end the Stride adjacent
to an enemy, that enemy is off-guard against the next Strike
you make against it with the weapon you drew before the
end of your next turn.
### Viking Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional
viking combat techniques, and you soon learned to handle
axe, sword, and shield in battle. Now, you can raid proudly
alongside your fellows. You gain the Shield Block reaction.
Additionally, you have familiarity with the battle axe, hatchet,
longsword, shield boss, shield spikes, and shortsword—for the
purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these weapons as
simple weapons.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
### Second Shield [free-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Trigger Your Shield Block causes your shield to break or be
destroyed.
You’re used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle,
and you’re prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby
object to defend yourself. You Interact to draw a shield on
your person or an unattended shield within your reach.
If there is an object within your reach that could serve
as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair—
you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM
determines if something can be used as an improvised
shield. Your new shield isn’t raised until you use the
Raise a Shield action, as normal.
### Into The Fray [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Requirements You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon
in one hand and a shield in another hand.
You charge into battle with shield-splintering fury. You
Leap, Stride, or Swim. Make two melee Strikes during this
movement, one with your one-handed melee weapon and
one with your shield or a weapon attached to the shield (like
a shield boss or shield spikes). You can make these Strikes
at any points during your movement, and each must target
a different enemy. Both attacks count toward your multiple
attack penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have
made both attacks.

Weapon Improviser
As far as you’re concerned, the best weapon to wield
is the one that your opponents never see coming. By
knowing how to fight effectively with whatever is at
hand, you ensure that you’re never caught unarmed, and
you often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly
think they’ve caught you unprepared. Whether you’re
smashing someone over the head with a barstool, tossing
a mug of ale in their face to blind them, or stabbing
your foes with a broken bottle, you can find weapons
anywhere and employ them creatively whenever a brawl
breaks out. Because you fight with disposable weapons,
you don’t need handle them with care as other warriors
do, and you can break them when needed to win a fight
without feeling any regrets later.
Improvised Weapon Ideas: Use these for inspiration.
Cavern: broken stalagmite, large mushroom, old bones;
Docks: barrel, crate, hook; Forest: branch, needles, or
thorns; Market: box, fruit, scale, sign; Courtroom
or Study: gavel, goblet, quill, lectern; Tavern:
bottle, mug, serving tray, stool
GM Advice: For a GM setting damage,
typically a one-handed improvised
weapon’s damage is 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8;
one that needs two hands is 1d8,
1d10, or occasionally 1d12, and
an extremely ineffective one might
deal 1 damage. Improvised weapons
typically have zero, one, or two traits,
and often have the nonlethal trait. Agile
improvised weapons usually have a smaller
die size. It’s extremely rare for an improvised
weapon to deal more than one die of damage,
but powerful magical objects might. Improvised
weapons should be fun and don’t last long, so feel
free to experiment!
### Weapon Improviser Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in martial weapons
You don’t take the normal –2 penalty to attack rolls
with improvised weapons. Improvised weapons
you use have a minimum weapon damage die of
1d6, or 1d4 if the improvised weapon is agile.

## Improvised Pummel Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
When you make a Strike with an improvised weapon
you’re wielding, you gain a +1 item bonus to the
attack roll, and you can have the Strike deal two
weapon damage dice instead of the improvised
weapon’s normal number. If the attack is a critical hit, the
improvised weapon breaks after the normal effects of a critical
hit occur. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level,
or if it’s an artifact, cursed item, or other item that’s difficult to
break or destroy, it doesn’t break but the attack is a normal hit
instead of a critical hit. You can choose not to get any of the
effects of Improvised Pummel on a Strike if you don’t want to
risk breaking the item. At 12th level, the item bonus increases
to +2, and at 16th level, the Strike deals three weapon damage
dice instead of the improvised weapon’s normal number.
If you’re benefiting from handwraps of mighty blows, you
use the handwraps’ item bonus if it’s higher and can choose
to use its number of damage dice. Any property runes from
the handwraps also apply if you use the handwraps’ number
of weapon damage dice, provided they could apply to the
improvised weapon (as determined by the GM).

## Surprise Strike Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
Whenever you make a Strike with an improvised weapon
against a creature that hasn’t observed you making a Strike
using an improvised weapon or that is otherwise ignorant of
your skill with improvised weapons, the creature is off-guard
against you for that Strike.

## Improvised Critical Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
You can apply critical specialization effects
to improvised weapons you wield. For
any given improvised weapon, the GM
determines which critical specialization
effect is most applicable, based on the
type of object it is.
### Makeshift Strike [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
You quickly snatch up whatever is nearby
and then attack with it as an improvised
weapon. You Interact to pick up an
unattended object in reach you
could use as an improvised weapon,
then Strike with that improvised
weapon.
### Shattering Strike [reaction] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Improvised Pummel
Trigger An improvised weapon you are
wielding becomes broken as a result of a
critical success on an Improvised Pummel.
The improvised weapon shatters,
destroying it completely but dealing
an additional 3d6 piercing damage to
the creature you hit with the Improvised
Pummel. This extra damage you apply
on the critical hit doesn’t double from the
critical hit, as normal.

221

Wrestler
Wrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill
against powerful foes. Specializing in a variety of grabs,
holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents
whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated
without taking their life. Though it appears brutal,
wrestling is considered a respectable and innocuous art.
The wrestling tradition is common all over
Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight
for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat.
The discipline’s focus on grappling is also useful in
non‑gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable
to contend with an opponent’s hold. Grappling is
particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a
difficult time completing the gestures for their spells
while grabbed. However, with the right technique, a
seasoned wrestler can hold down just about any foe
standing in their way. Such wrestlers are feared by their
foes and respected by their allies.
Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of
Belkzen, where orcs employ specialized grappling
techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as
mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially
to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe
that the process of subduing them in this manner creates
a stronger bond between mount and rider.
Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common
in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on
powerful grappling techniques to make sure they’re
never left without a means to fight on the battlefield,
even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers
engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient
gods and their past battles. These matches prominently
feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly
technical grappling maneuvers.
Additional Feats: 4th Combat Grab (Player Core 141),
Crushing Grab (page 119), Snagging Strike (Player Core
141); 8th Whirling Throw (page 123); 20th Godbreaker
(page 127)

Swallow you Whole.
### Disengaging Twist [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Trigger A creature gives you the grabbed or restrained
condition.

locks and holds makes you particularly adept at escaping
such predicaments. Attempt an Athletics check to Escape
the triggering condition. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to this check.
### Elbow Breaker [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or
restrained.
You bend your opponent’s body or limbs into
agonizing positions that make it difficult for
them to maintain their grip. Make an unarmed
melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or
restrained. This Strike has the following effects in addition
to its usual effects.
Critical Success You knock one held item out of the creature’s
grasp. It falls to the ground in the creature’s space.
Success You weaken your target’s grasp on the item.
Further attempts to Disarm the target of that item gain
a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other
checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature
can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on
the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature holds
the item.

### Suplex [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
Flexing your entire body, you heave your opponent over your
head and slam them into the ground. Make an unarmed melee
Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On

the number of weapon damage dice, and the target can barely
speak until the start of your next turn or until it Escapes,
whichever comes first. While it can barely speak, the target
can’t vocalize above a hoarse whisper, and it must succeed at
a DC 10 flat check or lose any action that requires speech. For
an action requiring speech that is also a manipulate action,

Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your
foes from easily escaping—with or without magical assistance.

separate effects aren’t obvious. The target is then temporarily
immune for 1 day.
