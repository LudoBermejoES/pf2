## Introduction

More of Everything
Player Core 2 provides even more options for player
characters. Along with the ancestries and classes
summarized on the following page, there are additional
general and skill feats, equipment, spells, and treasure
round out your characters’ abilities.
Alongside the eight new multiclass archetypes for the
classes in this book, you can find archetypes for all sorts
of characters starting on page 172. These can expand any
Pathfinder character in unexpected directions, helping them
discover new abilities to match their developing stories.
Many of these archetypes support combat specializations,
like the bastion and wrestler, while others show off the
roles characters may be stepping into, like the blessed one
and marshal. Even characters’ growing skills can uncover
deeper specializations, like the archaeologist and medic.
In addition to an expansive slate of ancestries, this
book also contains three versatile heritages suitable for
characters of any ancestry:
- Dhampirs are the mortal offspring of vampires,
walking the line between life and undeath.
- Dragonbloods possess obvious draconic traits owing to
dragons’ influence, either direct or on their ancestors.
- Duskwalkers are souls reincarnated as a result of a
bargain between psychopomps, the guides of the dead.
How to Use This Book
The new options in this book expand on those in Player
Core, and that book is required to use Player Core 2. It’s easy
to dive in using an ancestry, class, and archetype from this
book, but endless variations come to life when combining
these with options from Player Core and other sources.
If you’re creating a new character, you’re probably
interested in the new ancestries (page 7), classes (page 54),
and backgrounds (page 50).
Even characters you’ve already created can benefit
from archetypes (page 172), along with new options for
feats (page 224), spells (page 236), and items (page 272).
Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. This book
combines with Player Core, expanding on its options and giving you even more ways to play
the character you want!

## Uncommon Ancestries And Heritages

Each new ancestry in this book is uncommon. Though
uncommon elements of the game are usually acquired
during play, you choose your ancestry and heritage at
the beginning of the game. This means you should talk
to your group and GM about which uncommon ancestries
and heritages make sense for the story. In the pirate-laden
Shackles, tengu are a regular sight. But they’re even
more common in the eastern continent of Tian Xia, where
halflings and dwarves are uncommon! Even if your chosen
ancestry isn’t particularly common in the area where the
story takes place, most times you can work with your GM
and the other players to find a great way to incorporate
that character into the narrative. This discussion might
point toward ways an uncommon ancestry might figure
into the game and set the stage for how they interact with
the other characters. In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the
accompanying player’s guide might include information
about additional uncommon options that make sense for
that story and its region and grant you automatic access
to play them during those adventures.

## Rare And Unique Backgrounds

Some backgrounds have enough story weight that you
need to work with the rest of your group to determine
if they’re right for a particular story, like being heir to a
throne. You can find more information about these special
backgrounds on page 52.
This chapter expands your starting character options
from those available in Player Core and includes each
of the following sections. You can also find a summary
of each ancestry and heritage, along with the classes in
this book, on page 5 so that you can make the primary
decisions for creating your character at a glance.
Ancestries
Expand beyond the populous ancestries found in the
Player Core. Many of these ancestries are less common
than those presented in that book. The ancestry entry
format is described on page 41 of Player Core.
- Catfolk (page 8), or amurruns, are humanoid
felines who believe they were created to protect the
wilderness from great danger.
- Hobgoblins (page 12) are goblins’ stronger and
taller cousins, often devoted to proving themselves
in battle.
- Kholos (page 16) are hyena-headed humanoids who
practice ancestor worship and consume their dead
to honor them.
- Kobolds (page 20) are diligent crafters whose small,
reptilian forms are influenced in the egg by the
proximity of powerful magic.
- Lizardfolk (page 24), or iruxi, have fanged snouts,
long tails, and rich oral traditions.
- Ratfolk (page 28), or ysoki, pack into tight spaces
and are markedly industrious and fastidious.
- Tengu (page 32) are corvid-like humanoids with an
affinity for blades and the rumored mystical ability
to absorb bad luck.
- Tripkees (page 36) are froglike humanoids who
rely on their cunning and curiosity to keep their
communities safe.
Versatile Heritages
As in Player Core, this book presents versatile heritages,
which are certain heritages that can occur across all
ancestries, and which you can choose instead of one of
the heritages listed in your ancestry’s section. For instance,
if your father was a vampire, you could be a dhampir
whether you’re a human, orc, or catfolk. Rules for versatile
heritages are found on page 74 of Player Core.
- Dhampirs (page 42) are part vampires due to an
early connection to vampire blood.
Your character’s ancestry and background tell the story of who you were before you became
an adventurer, as well as who you might strive to become one day. But not everyone fits
neatly into the most common ancestries or backgrounds. You might be a birdlike tengu, a
scaled kobold, or a curious catfolk with a one-of-a-kind background in your story. Perhaps
your ancestry carries the blood of dragons or vampires. Only you can decide!

## Chapter 1:


## Ancestries & Backgrounds

- Dragonbloods (page 44) are scions of powerful
dragons, often exhibiting their majesty and magic.
- Duskwalkers (page 48) are souls reincarnated
into mortal form, who are tied to psychopomp
guardians.
Backgrounds
This chapter contains new backgrounds for characters
from all walks of life, from couriers to saboteurs. This
section also includes a set of special rare backgrounds
that you and your GM might agree to use in a campaign.
- Common Backgrounds (page 50)

Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine the
features of felines and humanoids in both appearance
and temperament. They enjoy learning new things,
collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their
loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves
as the chosen guardians of natural places in the world
and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of
overwhelming opposition. They believe that strong
communities, breadth of experience, and continual selfimprovement
aid them in this fight.
As quick as their reflexes are, catfolk have quicker
tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in
an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily
purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.
If you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly,
and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk.

## Catfolk

You might...
- Demonstrate genuine interest by asking a lot of
enthusiastic questions.
- Avoid interpersonal conflict by giving someone a
cold shoulder or by simply leaving the area.
Others probably...
- Think you monopolize conversations with your
incessant queries or opinions.
- Ascribe more emotion than you feel to your
involuntary purrs or growling.
Physical Description
Although all catfolk walk upright and have soft fur, a
tail, large ears, and vertical pupils, they show at least as
much variety as ordinary felines. Catfolk have nimble
fingers with short claws that are usually retractable.
Catfolk mature quickly and are able to walk at only a few
months old, but they start their careers at roughly the same
age as humans do and live to be 60 or 70 years of age.
Society
Catfolk call themselves amurruns, although many
consider this name to be private. They raise their children
in large extended families, where they are given latitude
to explore and get into trouble from a remarkably young
age. Catfolk learn a trade in a loose apprenticeship, and
the majority learn several trades over their lives.
Catfolk societies are often led by an appointed leader
who speaks on behalf of the community and mediates
disputes. They prefer to deal with grievances by making
an elaborate showing of disinterest, or even leaving a
community for a time so the problem can die away.
Catfolk are given short names in their youth.
Adolescent catfolk are free to choose a different
name when they first leave home.
Sample Names: Alyara, Crinto, Drewan, Espes,
Ferrus, Gerran, Halhat, Hoya, Ruun, Sevastin,
Tespa, Yonsol, Zakkar, Zathra
Beliefs
Most catfolk believe they were uplifted
from great primeval cats to confront the evil
abominations despoiling natural places and
laboring to unmake reality. Many, however, enjoy
the freedom to travel and like to set their own paths
in life. Religious catfolk most often practice a nebulous
form of animism, appeasing the spirits of the land and the
creatures they hunt to preserve the natural order.
Popular Edicts travel the world, protect natural places,
fastidiously maintain your appearance
Popular Anathema leave questions unanswered

Catfolk Heritages
Catfolk have ancestors as varied as any felines. Choose one of the following
catfolk heritages at 1st level.
Clawed Catfolk
Your family has particularly long, sharp claws capable of delivering bleeding
wounds with a wicked swipe. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d6
slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile,
finesse, and unarmed traits.
Hunting Catfolk
You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a
particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30
feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s
location, as explained on page 433 of Player Core. The GM will usually
double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range
if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Track a creature or
object if you’ve smelled it before.
Jungle Catfolk
You’re descended from jungle stalkers and can move swiftly through scrub
and underbrush. You ignore difficult terrain from undergrowth, and greater
difficult terrain from undergrowth is only difficult terrain for you.
Liminal Catfolk
You’ve inherited a closeness to the far corners of the world, where the boundaries
between dimensions grow thin. You can cast the detect magic cantrip as an occult
innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to half your level rounded up. You
also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Recall Knowledge
about creatures that originated on planes other than the Universe.
Nine Lives Catfolk
Your family has always seems to bounce back from disaster, not through
physical hardiness or specialized skill, but from sheer luck. Other catfolk
whisper that you have nine lives. While you’re dying, you don’t add your
dying value to the DC of your recovery checks (this means the DC is typically
10). In addition, you gain the Diehard general feat.
Sharp-Eared Catfolk
You were born with big, expressive ears that move with your moods and
perk up at any unexpected sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek
action. As long as you’re aware of a creature via sound, once per round, your
ears can help you Point Out the creature to all allies as a free action.
Winter Catfolk
You have a thick coat of fur that protects you from the cold. You gain cold
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental
cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes
extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level). As a catfolk,

Taller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins
are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad
shoulders and long, powerful arms. The Avistani cycle
of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been
upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin
nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas.
Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other
nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously
investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than
conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered
terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is
simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough
strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold
soldiers might prove to be powerful allies.
You might...
- Seek out the most effective and practical solutions
to any problem.
- Encourage a clear chain of command among any
group you travel with, following orders even if you
disagree with them.

## Hobgoblin

Others probably...
- Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation
and intimidating appearance.
- Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication,
and discipline.
Physical Description
Hobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as
well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned.
They’re remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from
illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long
periods of time with little difficulty.
Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk,
and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They
reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood
around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age.
Society
Hobgoblins structure their society after military
hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming
collectives or trading houses organize into regiments,
companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high
place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors.
Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most
hobgoblins don’t trust it over the strength of their own
sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many
hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing
the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing.
Like goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple,
though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural
and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter
their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually
in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event.
Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both
pointless and presumptuous; an individual’s merits and
demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an
association with a particular lineage.
Sample Names: Aze, Druknar, Ghargam, Hathkren,
Imakra, Kralaeng, Mazkol, Olzu, Rezal, Sivkrag,
Volmak, Zornum
Beliefs
Most hobgoblins prefer to live within established hierarchies.
While many consider sentimentality weak, those with mild
temperaments have recently found success in diplomacy and
international outreach. Faith has little place in hobgoblin
society, as many feel it is impractical, though religious
hobgoblins can gain a begrudging modicum of acceptance
due to their useful healing magic.
Popular Edicts disdain arcane magic, hide sentimentality and
positive emotions, jump at chances to prove yourself
Popular Anathema disobey military orders

Hobgoblin Heritages
Hobgoblins have a wide range of physiological differences based primarily
on their family lineage. Choose one of the following hobgoblin heritages at
1st level.
Elfbane Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund
goblins to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately
freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral
resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist
Elf Magic reaction.
Resist Elf Magic [reaction] Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but
haven’t rolled yet; Effect Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the triggering effect is
arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.
Runtboss Hobgoblin
You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are
smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you
bellow. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an
Intimidation check to Coerce a goblin, you get a critical success instead; if
you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
Shortshanks Hobgoblin
You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins,
making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong,
muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you
in riding and climbing—and you’ve trained at riding in a saddle from an
extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not offguard
while you Climb.
Smokeworker Hobgoblin
Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations,
laboring on projects that bring smoke and fire to the field of battle. You
gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically
succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature
is concealed only by smoke.
Warmarch Hobgoblin
You come from a line of wandering mercenaries constantly on the march and
scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but don’t critically fail, to Subsist
in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When
exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop.
Warrenbred Hobgoblin
Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other
hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. While you’re underground, when you
target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce
the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In
addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a
critical success instead.
Hobgoblin Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a
hobgoblin, you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

## Rarity

Uncommon

## Hit Points

(such as the languages prevalent in
your region).

## Traits

just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is

13


## 1St Level


## Alchemical Scholar Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat. If you would
automatically gain that feat (from your background or the
alchemist class, for example), you instead gain a different
1st-level Crafting skill feat. Add an additional common 1st-level
alchemical formula to your formula book when you take this
feat. Each time you gain a level beyond 1st, add one common
alchemical formula of that level to your formula book.

## Cantorian Reinforcement Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

The life energy that helped create the first hobgoblins is
particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing
maladies. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a
disease or poison, you get a critical success instead. If you
have a different ability that would improve the save in this
way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you
roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

## Hobgoblin Lore Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You’ve studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all
of which have a militaristic bent. You gain the trained proficiency
rank in Athletics and Crafting. If you would automatically become
trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Hobgoblin Lore.
### Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 1

## Hobgoblin

You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the hobgoblin
trait. You have familiarity with weapons with the hobgoblin trait
plus the composite longbow, composite shortbow, glaive, longbow,
longsword, and shortbow—for the purpose of proficiency, you
treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons
and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
### Leech-Clip [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Hobgoblin

You are trained to capture deserters, or “leeches.” Make a melee
Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes
a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty
on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the

Kholo have bad reputations as brutal raiders and
demon-worshipers. Many believe that kholo are witches,
cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex. Kholo
are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders.
To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any
loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their
packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but
victory, whether it’s mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of
immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints,
and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the
kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism.
Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a
grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons.
Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring
their enemy’s cunning or strength into the clan.
You might...
- Be physically demonstrative—hugging,
punching, or licking your friends.

## Kholo

- Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.
Others probably...
- Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.
- Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.
Physical Description
Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles,
sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their
bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and
softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in
an off-white, tan, or brown shade; spots and stripes are
both common. Kholo typically stand between 6 and 7 feet
tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and
correspondingly stronger. Kholo are considered adults at
15 and live about 60 years on average.
Society
Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20
family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members.
They are ruled by a council of female kholo who are typically
selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus
on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—
they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon
their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers
and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic
knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything
else relevant to the clan.
Newborn kholo are given a root name, typically
that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as
this is considered narcissistic). As a kholo reaches certain
milestones in their life, they add descriptors to their name.
Sample Names: Baobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in
Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia,
Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker
Beliefs
Kholo have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to
life and prioritize results over methods. They are usually
loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward
outsiders—whether this behavior is considered acceptable
varies depending on who they view as “their people.”
Many kholo pay homage to Lamashtu, both as the
originator of their people and a guide in a chaotic world.
However, some kholo often give homage to Calistria and
Shelyn. Nethys is the patron of bonekeepers.
Popular Edicts strengthen your allies and packmates,
recount the tales of your ancestors, neutralize foes
with tactics and cunning
Popular Anathema risk yourself or your
packmates for no reason, let a dead kholo or
loved one rot like carrion

Kholo Heritages
Kholo physiology can vary greatly across the land. Choose one of the
following kholo heritages at 1st level.
Ant Kholo
You’re a sharp-featured, big-eared kholo about 3 feet tall. Many are
skeptical that you are in fact a kholo. Your size is Small instead of Medium.
You are trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained
in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to
Lie when specifically claiming innocence, to Deception DCs against Sense
Motive checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative checks when you roll
Deception for initiative.
Cave Kholo
Storytellers spin ancient tales claiming that kholo lived in caves and
underground before most of your kind ventured into the light. You’re a
throwback to these ancients, with a broad chest and markings that resemble
short black slashes instead of spots. Your eyes are developed to see perfectly
in the dark, a valuable advantage to your clan. You gain darkvision.
Dog Kholo
You’re a nimble-bodied kholo with a prehistoric, almost dog-like build.
Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight
like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. If you have both
hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
Great Kholo
You’re an imposing, powerful kholo, with tawny fur and brown spots on
your hide. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8 and gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Reposition, Shove, or Trip.
Sweetbreath Kholo

you can use to entrance your prey. You are trained in Diplomacy (or
another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to checks to Make an Impression if the target can
smell your breath.
Winter Kholo
You’re a hardy kholo covered in thick, tufted fur that makes you able to
survive in the harsh winters of the colder territories. You gain cold resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as
if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme
cold becomes severe, and so on).
Witch Kholo
You’re a shaggy, dark-furred kholo capable of making some truly uncanny
sounds. You can cast the figment cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A
cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. In
addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Create a Diversion
and Impersonate when using only your voice.

Every kobold instinctively understands the importance
of power, and many are inclined to venerate those who
have it, whether they be mighty dragons, cruel fiends,
imperious fey, or even ancient artifacts. Kobolds seek
out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—
after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves
an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs
incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits
(and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren’s
benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters
and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their
territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever
ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove
happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it’s to
their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make
their fortunes in the wider world.
If you want a character with deadly cunning and who
bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should
play a kobold.
You might...
- Analyze your surroundings, always looking for
ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.
- Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group
dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.

## Kobold

Others probably...
- Assume that you are cowardly and won’t stick
around in the face of danger.
- Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness,
especially when it comes to building defenses.
Physical Description
Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids
with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns. Their
features often reflect the nature of their warren’s benefactor,
such as vestigial draconic wings or glowing crystalline
growths. These differences set warrens apart, though all
kobolds are generally easily recognizable as such.
Kobolds mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12
years and living to about 60. Some rare kobolds live even
longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor.
Society
Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them
alive. They’re secretive or subservient around powerful
creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades
once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a
dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an
artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly
adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their
benefactor’s personality. However, kobolds are infamous
for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source
of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.
A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a
syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and
accomplish great deeds, they might add more syllables to
their names. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an
effort to better fit into a community, in which case they
typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that
group.
Sample Names: Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn,
Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak,
Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz
Beliefs
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural
respect for hierarchies and rules, relying on their
ancestral social strategies for survival.
Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds. They’re
often drawn to deities related to their benefactors, such as
Asmodeus if the benefactor is a devil, or dragon deities like
Apsu and Dahak if the benefactor is a dragon. Kobolds also
often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with
powerful magical creatures as figureheads.
Popular Edicts find your place in any power structure, take
pride in your allies’ strength, win with your wits
Popular Anathema face a threat alone, throw caution to the wind

Kobold Heritages
Proud, opportunistic, and crafty, kobolds manifest certain physical aspects
due to their benefactor. Choose one of the following kobold heritages at
1st level.
Cavernstalker Kobold
You hatched in a warren with narrow tunnels that was also home to a
being of primal earth energy, which has made you limber and flexible. When
Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone features, you move
at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and
you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb). This doesn’t
affect you if you’re using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an Acrobatics
check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
Dragonscaled Kobold
Thanks to your warren’s association with a dragon, your scales are sturdier
than other kobolds’. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of
6. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against dragon breath, effects
with the sleep trait, and effects that would make you paralyzed.
Elementheart Kobold
When you hatched, you imprinted on a creature strongly associated with
one of the Elemental Planes, such as an elemental or genie. Choose air, earth,
fire, metal, water, or wood for your elemental benefactor. You gain resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage type associated with
your elemental benefactor: cold for air, electricity for earth, fire for fire, sonic
for metal, acid for water, or poison for wood.
Spellhorn Kobold
Since hatching in the vicinity of a powerful source of magic, a trace of it
flows through your veins. Choose one common cantrip from the arcane
spell list (238, Player Core 304–307). You can Cast this Spell as an arcane
innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your
level rounded up. You are trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC
statistics, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
Strongjaw Kobold
Your warren is noted for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, either to help
protect against natural predators or due to reverence of a mighty beast. You
gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your jaws are in
the brawling group and have the finesse and unarmed traits.
Tunnelflood Kobold
You grew up in a warren crisscrossed by underwater passages, whether
natural or excavated, and were influenced by a powerful aquatic entity or
being of primal water. You gain a swim Speed of 15 feet.
Venomtail Kobold
Thanks to the proximity of a venomous creature to your warren, you were
born with a vestigial spur in your tail that secretes deadly venom. You gain
the Tail Toxin action.
Tail Toxin [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per day; Requirements You are wielding
a piercing or slashing weapon; Effect You apply your tail’s venom to a piercing or
slashing weapon. If your next Strike with that weapon before the end of your next
turn hits and deals damage, you deal persistent poison damage equal to your level
to the target.

a master in Crafting and five if you’re legendary). Snares

additional distance isn’t cumulative with the increased Leap
distance from the Powerful Leap feat. In addition, when you
attempt a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet
farther than you normally would based on the result of your
Athletics check, though you still can’t jump farther than your

Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires
considered ancient even by the elves.
Lizardfolk move through the societies of other
humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators.
They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding
rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though lizardfolk
have adapted to many different environments, many of
them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using
their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As
a result, they usually prefer equipment that is not easily
damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for
gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.

## Lizardfolk

You might...
- Hold your people’s history in high regard and look
to the past for solutions to present problems.
- Strive to adapt perfectly to your environment while
also keeping your culture and traditions intact.
Others probably...
- Assume you are beholden to tradition and have
ancient knowledge.
- See you as cold-blooded and callous due to your
subdued physical reactions.
Physical Description
Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but
share toothy snouts and long, powerful tails. Many sport
dorsal spikes or flashy neck frills that hint at their clan
lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15
and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands
6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime,
gaining strength and size with age.
Society
Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are
raised communally from the moment they break from
their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching
back thousands of years, brought to life through
epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites
performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk
are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future.
If they seem slow to act, it’s because their long history
has taught them the value of patience.
True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they
are partially or mostly submerged in water. Lizardfolk
bones often adorn the walls, as many lizardfolk believe
these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when
the residents are in danger.
Lizardfolk names are typically chosen by the clan’s
astrologer in accordance to omens and which star
signs are ascendant when an iruxi egg hatches.
Sample Names: Arasheg, Barashk, Essaru, Enshuk,
Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru,
Tizkar, Utakish, Zelkelek
Beliefs
Most iruxis are unconcerned with heavy questions of
morality and focus their efforts on a local level. Iruxi religion
plays a large role in their culture, but in a heavily practical
way, blending animism and ancestor worship with druidic
rites. Of the gods, only Gozreh is commonly revered.
Popular Edicts keep memories of the past alive, wait for
your prey, adapt your plans to fit the environment
Popular Anathema defy the will of the stars

Lizardfolk Heritages
While most lizardfolk prefer wetlands, eons of evolution and cultural
adaptation enable them to live in more challenging environments. Choose
one of the following lizardfolk heritages at 1st level.
Cliffscale Lizardfolk
Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the Combat Climber
feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren’t wearing footwear, you can use the
sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you
roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.
Cloudleaper Lizardfolk
Your body is light with flaps of skin along your limbs that catch the air that
passes beneath you. As long as you can act and have enough room, you can
open the flaps to slow any fall just enough to avoid taking damage (whether
you have the room to do so depends on the GM’s discretion).
Frilled Lizardfolk
You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, Demoralizing your foes.
When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and
you don’t take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn’t
understand your language. You also gain the Threatening Approach action.
Threatening Approach [two-actions] Effect You Stride to be adjacent to a foe and Demoralize
that foe. If you succeed, the foe is frightened 2 instead of frightened 1.
Sandstrider Lizardfolk
Your thick scales help you retain water and combat the sun’s glare. You gain fire
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). Environmental heat effects are
one step less extreme for you, and you can go 10 times as long as normal before
you are affected by starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear
or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
Unseen Lizardfolk
You can change your skin color to blend in with your surroundings, making
minor shifts with a single action and dramatic changes over the course of
an hour. When you’re in an area where your coloration is roughly similar
to the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the
minor, single-action application of this ability to make localized changes that
help you blend into your surroundings, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks until your surroundings change in coloration or pattern.
Wetlander Lizardfolk
Your family is descended from the most common lizardfolk heritage, and you
are accustomed to aquatic environments. You gain a 15-foot swim Speed.
Woodstalker Lizardfolk
You move easily through thick forest and jungle, using every branch or bush.
You can always use the Take Cover action when in forest or jungle terrain to
gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you would normally be able
to Take Cover behind. You gain the Terrain Stalker feat, even if you’re not
trained in Stealth, and you must choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
Lizardfolk Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a lizardfolk,
you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

Ysoki are beings that most surface-dwelling humanoids
refer to as “ratfolk.” They are a communal people who
prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals
living in a given home. If they can’t find homes in town,
ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes,
as these provide great storage for the many and varied
goods they bring back from trading expeditions.
Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found
on the road in merchant caravans. They’re good with
their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything
out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They’re
also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed
full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous
generations and stowed away in preparation for some
future emergency.
If you want a character who is smart, fast, welltraveled,
and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!
You might...
- Have pride in your large extended family, and stay
in contact with everyone in it.
- Like to travel near and far in search of new
experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way.
Others probably...
- Are surprised by your careful grooming and other
fastidious habits.
- Think you’re crowding them and invading their
personal space.

## Ratfolk

Physical Description
Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless
tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or
black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs
around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however;
even a single family group can exhibit substantial
variation in hair color, eye color, or size.
Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though
this is also reinforced through their strong social
structures. Because their appearance is often considered
disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even
mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their
physical features with layers of clothing when moving
through spaces dominated by other ancestries.
Society
Ysoki culture values cooperation and community.
Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social
occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and
connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a
long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk
travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons
are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen
vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large
giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals.
Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have
been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes
with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are
often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids
they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and
endure them only when outside their communities.
Sample Names: Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto,
Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak,
Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess
Beliefs
Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract
concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be
chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but
they also obey strict social codes.
Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to
acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area,
Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother
Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to
ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own
interests above others. To most ratfolk,
Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those
things they need done, but which they
would not wish to do.
Popular Edicts put your community’s interests above your own,
maintain a cleanly appearance, be honest in your dealings
Popular Anathema throw away something that might be useful

Ratfolk Heritages
Ratfolk are native to underground regions, but they are a highly adaptable
ancestry that has been found in almost every environment. Choose one of
the following ratfolk heritages at 1st level.
Deep Rat
Your ancestors lived deeper underground than other ratfolk, granting you
the ability to see in the dark. You gain darkvision.
Desert Rat
You are native to arid plains and likely grew up traveling the roads. If you
have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on
all fours. In addition, environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for
you, and you can go 10 times longer than normal before you are affected by
starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter,
environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
Longsnout Rat
Your long snout gives you a keener sense of smell than most ratfolk. You gain
imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense
of smell to determine a creature’s location, as explained on page 433 of the
Player Core. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from
the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to
Seek a creature or object within the range of your scent.
Sewer Rat
You come from a long line of ratfolk with a community based in the sewers
beneath a large settlement. You are immune to the disease putrid plague. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons.
If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get
a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve
the save in this way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you
roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.
Shadow Rat
Your ancestors lived in dark spaces underground, granting you dark fur and a
vaguely unnatural mien. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Intimidation
and can use Intimidation to Coerce animals. When you Demoralize an animal,
you don’t take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If you would
automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class,
for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice.
Animals’ attitudes toward you begin one degree worse than normal,
usually starting at unfriendly instead of indifferent for domesticated animals,
and hostile instead of unfriendly for wild animals.
Snow Rat
You have a thicker coat and bulkier frame to defend against the cold,
granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat
environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible
cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Tunnel Rat
You can easily compress your body and squeeze through gaps. You gain the Quick
Squeeze feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren’t trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces
not tight enough to require the Squeeze action aren’t difficult terrain for you.

## Ratfolk

You’ve learned how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You
can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane
storage containers or vehicles. For example, you can fit 6 Bulk

level, and to retrain into and out of this feat.

## Warren Navigator Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You gain the trained proficiency rank in Survival. If you would
automatically become trained in Survival (from your background
or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your
choice. When you Sense Direction or attempt a roll against a
quandary spell, you get a result one degree of success better than
you rolled. You don’t take a penalty to Sense Direction when you
lack a compass.

## 5Th Level

If a foe of a larger size than you critically hits and damages you,
that foe is off-guard to you for 1 round.

Tengu are survivalists and conversationalists, equally at
home living off the wilderness and finding a niche in dense
cities. They accumulate knowledge, tools, and companions,
adding them to their collection as they travel.
The tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search
of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to
lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengu
notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”—
members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately or
otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of
conditions and locations, tengu tend to be nonjudgmental,
though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has
often led some to regard them with suspicion.
If you want to play a character hailing from a rich history
of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new
practices as needed, you should play a tengu.

## Tengu

You might...
- Be gregarious and eager to find a flock of your own.
- Voraciously absorb the practices of those around you,
sometimes even forgetting where they came from.
Others probably...
- Get confused by your simultaneous respect for and
disregard of tradition.
- Have trouble reading your expressions or regard
you with suspicion and superstition.
Physical Description
Tengu have many avian characteristics. Their faces are tipped
with sharp beaks and their scaled forearms and lower legs
end in talons. As closed footwear tends to fit poorly unless
custom made, many tengu wear open sandals or simply go
barefoot. Tengu are rarely more than 5 feet tall, and they
are even lighter than their smaller frames would suggest, as
they have hollow bones. A small number of tengu have
vestigial wings.
Society
The greatest divide in tengu society is between
tengu remaining in their ancestral home and those
who have dispersed across the world. Tengu refer to
these two groups as those “in the roost” and those
“migrating,” respectively. Roosted tengu tend to be
more traditionalist and conservative and are especially
concerned with preserving their culture in the face of
years of erosion from oppression. Migrating tengu, on
the other hand, voraciously absorb the culture of the
various nations and settlements that they now call home.
Roosted tengu tend toward more traditional names,
while migrating tengu readily absorb and repurpose the
culture of those around them.
Sample Names: Arkkak, Chuko, Dolgra, Dorodara,
Kakkariel, Kora, Marrak, Mossarah, Pularrka, Rarorel,
Ruk, Tak-Tak, Tsukotarra
Beliefs
Tengu often follow the faith of the region in which they
were raised, though the tengu ancestral deity is the storm
god Hei Feng. Before their diaspora, tengu practiced a
syncretic faith that blended a polytheistic worship of
the deities responsible for creating the natural world. As
tengu folklore posits that tengu long ago descended from
the night sky on shooting stars to rest upon Golarion’s
highest peaks, animist rites were practiced on mountains
and other great natural features.
Popular Edicts protect tengu traditions, adopt the lessons of
other cultures, seek out natural wonders
Popular Anathema lose control of your emotions

Tengu Heritages
As a fluid people scattered from their original homes, there are a wide variety
of tengu on Golarion. Choose one of the following tengu heritages at 1st level.
Dogtooth Tengu
In addition to a beak, your mouth also features a number of vicious, pointed
teeth. Some legends claim your powerful jaws can even bite through steel.
While you aren’t that strong yet, your fangs can still leave terrible wounds.
Your beak unarmed attack gains the deadly d8 trait.
Jinxed Tengu
Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now they slide off
your feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or
misfortune effect, you get a critical success instead. When you would gain
the doomed condition, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, reduce the
value of the doomed condition you would gain by 1.
Mountainkeeper Tengu
You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits
of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the vitality lash cantrip as
a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to
half your level rounded up. Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage
or ancestry feat, you can decide whether it’s a divine or primal spell.
Skyborn Tengu
Your bones may be especially light, you may be a rare tengu with wings,
or your connection to the spirits of wind and sky might be stronger than
most, slowing your descent through the air. You take no damage from falling,
regardless of the distance you fall.
Stormtossed Tengu
Whether due to a blessing from Hei Feng or hatching from your egg during
a squall, you are resistant to storms. You gain electricity resistance equal to
half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the flat check to
target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by rain or fog.
Taloned Tengu
Your talons are every bit as sharp and strong as your beak. You gain a talons
unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your talons are in the
brawling group and have the agile, finesse, unarmed, and versatile P traits.
Wavediver Tengu
You’re one of the rare tengu who can cut through water like a bird through
air, and you often lurk in rivers or oceans where few expect you. You gain a
swim Speed of 15 feet.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a tengu,

You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Tengu Lore.
### Tengu Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 1

## Tengu

### Eat Fortune [reaction] FEAT 5

## Concentrate Divine Tengu

Frequency once per day
Trigger A creature within 60 feet uses a fortune or misfortune
effect.
As someone tries to twist fate, you consume the interference.
The triggering effect is disrupted. If it’s a misfortune effect,
Eat Fortune gains the fortune trait; if it’s a fortune effect, Eat
Fortune gains the misfortune trait. This fortune or misfortune
applies to the same roll the triggering effect would have, so
you couldn’t negate a fortune effect with Eat Fortune and then
apply a misfortune effect to the same roll.
### Long-Nosed Form [one-action] FEAT 5

## Concentrate Polymorph Primal Tengu

You transform into a specific, curious-looking human form. This
human form is the same age and body type as your tengu form
and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as height, though
your nose remains as long as your beak and your complexion
has red undertones, no matter the skin color of your human
form. Using Long-Nosed Form counts as creating a disguise
for the Impersonate use of Deception. Due to your imperfect
transformation, your transformation doesn’t automatically defeat
Perception DCs to determine whether you are human, though
you may be able to explain away or hide your tengu traits.
You lose your beak unarmed Strike in your human form, as
well as any other unarmed Strikes you gained from a tengu
heritage or ancestry feat. You remain in your human form
indefinitely, until you Dismiss this effect.

ground at the end of this movement, you fall.

fan to focus your ancestral magic. You gain a tengu feather
fan: a magic item of light Bulk with a level equal to your level
and the primal trait. You (and only you) can cast tengu magic
with the Wave Fan activation. If your fan is lost or destroyed,
you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if
you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers.
Your tengu feather fan contains a 1st-rank gust of wind spell.
Further feats might add more spells and grant you additional
activations of your tengu feather fan, but you can never have
more than three activations per day, no matter how many such
feats you have.
Activate—Wave Fan (manipulate) Frequency once per day;
Effect You cast your choice of one spell contained in your
tengu feather fan. You can instead cast a cantrip you’ve
gained from a heritage or an ancestry feat; this doesn’t use

per day, as part of using Long-Nosed Form, you also gain the

35

Tripkees are a shy and cautious people who generally seek
to avoid being drawn into the affairs of others. Despite
their cautious outlook and small stature, adventurous
tripkees still take bold and noble action when the situation
demands it.
Tripkees are reclusive treetop survivalists who harvest
their homes’ bounty, utilizing their canopy homes as
natural fortifications against the threats posed by larger
predators. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools
has led to tripkees often being mischaracterized as
rudimentary, though this does poor justice to their skill
in the cultivation of hidden orchards and camouflaged
causeways tucked away in treetop nations. Tripkees are
most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade,
explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.
If you want a character who is small in stature but
large in spirit, and possesses qualities of a tree frog, you
should play a tripkee.
You might…
- Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment
when overcoming challenges.
- Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales
of exploitative strangers.
Others probably...
- Trust in your impartial, measured approach to
understanding situations and solving problems.
- Give you space, fearing that touching you would
prove toxic.

## Tripkee

Physical Description
Tripkees resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes,
wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames
and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing,
while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage
that varies by their home environment—green and brown
for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian
communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee
grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2
feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they’re
only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely
live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals
occasionally live as long as a century.
Society
Tripkees lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle
within which they reshape the landscape to suit their
needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing
trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and
more techniques that often escape an agriculturist’s eye.
These strategies rely on community cooperation as well
as dispersed populations, so tripkees commonly live in
small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and
relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved tripkee lives and
lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves
threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike.
Tripkee names often include resonant vowels and
chirped consonants that remain difficult for nontripkees
to vocalize properly. Tripkees that travel widely
often adopt one or more names more easily replicated
by their associates.
Sample Names: Aalpo’ol, Bogwynne, Ctaprak, Eegru,
Gpoun, Gruoksh, Hrrauti, Iopo, Iykiki, Kyrsiik, Mhruugu,
Oplugo, Quaasol, Yolkuu, Ztaal
Beliefs
Taught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes
of life and death, many tripkees adopt patient attitudes.
Those who take a more active role suppressing cruelty
may join organizations that blend religion and philosophy,
such as the tripkee fiend-keepers who absorb an unholy
being into their soul to contain and eventually transform
its villainy through their own virtuous acts. Nature deities
like Gozreh or Erastil often earn tripkees’ respect, yet
communities usually prefer less prominent, more intimate
divinities such as empyreal lords, psychopomp ushers, or
the fey Eldest.
Popular Edicts improve your part of the world without causing
harm to others, practice patience whenever possible
Popular Anathema create architecture that supplants
the natural world, take rash action that brings risk to
your community

Tripkee Heritages
Choose one of the following tripkee heritages at 1st level.
Poisonhide Tripkee
You may be small, but the poison glands concealed across your body hide a
deadly defense. You gain the Toxic Skin reaction.

by Grappling you, successfully hitting you with an unarmed attack, or using a touchrange

Trigger A creature with the animal, beast, elemental, fey, fungus,
or plant trait attacks you, and you can see the attacker.
Your canny understanding of natural and primal creatures
helps you predict and dodge their attacks. The triggering
attack roll targets your Nature DC instead of your AC. Though
this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t
remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties.
For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra
damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn’t
take the –2 circumstance penalty against the attack.

## Jungle Strider Feat 1


## Tripkee

You are adept at dodging roots, foliage, and other jungle
obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain in forests and jungles.

The most common versatile heritages by far are those
born from the pairing of two different ancestries, such
as the aiuvarin and dromaar mixed heritages (Player
Core 82). Other individuals are born under far stranger
circumstances, such as having a parent who was affected
by monstrous, undead, or extraplanar energies. As these
circumstances aren’t unique to a single ancestry, these
heritages are likewise shared by many ancestries.
Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages.
Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through
specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many,
however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy,
whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors,
or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that
plane. These individuals are known as planar scions.
Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile
heritages aren’t limited to a single ancestry, a versatile
heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any
ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common
among certain ancestries than others, and some might list
additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM
may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use
a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting.
Playing a Versatile
Heritage
To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select
your ancestry, just like you would for any character.
You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and
attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from
that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from
those normally available to that ancestry, apply your
chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from
your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or
replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry.
Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have
only one, and you can’t have any other heritage in
addition to your versatile heritage.
Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an
ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry.
In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting
abilities your character has.
When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from
those available to your ancestry as well as those specific
to your versatile heritage.
Lineage Feats
Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have the
lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological lineage
your character has—such as the type of vampire that
birthed a dhampir character, or the type of dragon that
influenced a dragonblood’s birth. You can have only
one lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at
1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out of this feat.
Roleplaying a Versatile Heritage
As most versatile heritages are
uncommon or rare, playing
a character with a versatile
heritage generally offers unique and sometimes
challenging roleplaying opportunities. The origins of
a character’s versatile heritage immediately offers a
The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or dabbling
with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul. The children born to
such parents might have traits from each of their parents or physiological manifestations of
the forces their ancestors were influenced by, manifesting as a specific heritage. For more
information about versatile heritages, see pages 74–75 of Player Core.

## Versatile Heritages



## Dhampir

strong chance to create an interesting and compelling
background for your character. While obvious events
related to a character’s birth, such as having unique
parentage, offer explanations for a character’s versatile
heritage, this might also be a good opportunity to create
an even more personalized explanation for the heritage.
For example, a dhampir character could have
been born due to long-term exposure to void energy,
transforming the character before birth. A dragonblood
character might have earned the blessing of a powerful
dragon at some point during their adult life, changing
the character into a dragonblood far later than usual.
The circumstances—well-known or otherwise—of a
duskwalker’s death could be full of interesting story
potential. Players of characters with versatile heritages
are encouraged to work with their GMs and fellow
players to create interesting origin ideas without
monopolizing the spotlight at the table.
A versatile heritage can influence not only a character’s
origins, but also their outlook and personality. The
nature of a versatile heritage causes a character to
stand out among most cultures and societies. In many
cases, a versatile heritage might isolate a character.
This can manifest in distrust of the character’s origins,
an unhealthy fixation with the character, or any other
unfortunately othering responses from strangers. The
isolation that comes from these reactions could cause a
character to become bitter or withdrawn.
The nature of the versatile heritage could also lead
to the character having to “live in two worlds.” A
character of mixed ancestry heritage might need to learn
two different sets of cultures and societal expectations.
Learning to navigate these expectations can come with
its own roleplaying challenges.
Of course, players who would rather ignore all of these
roleplaying opportunities and challenges are encouraged
to do so as well. Roleplaying a character should be a
rewarding and exciting experience overall, and removing
these additional aspects is perfectly reasonable.
In This Book
This book includes the rules for three versatile heritages.
Dhampir
The mortal offspring of undead vampires are
caught between life and undeath, mortality and
immortality, mundane existence and powerful
magic. Dhampirs enjoy long life spans
and otherworldly charm, but their
ghostly pallor and the nature of their
parentage make their lives in humanoid
societies difficult.
The two lineages for dhampirs found
here are svetochers, who come from the most
common vampires called moroi, and straveikas, born
of aged and unsettling nosferatus.
Dragonblood
While there are many ways a mortal can be imbued with
draconic powers, dragonbloods have an inherent natural
affinity. Children born of draconic lineage or blessed by
a dragon deity find themselves skirting the line of mortal
and dragon, often taking on draconic appearances and
boasting strong personalities.
The four lineages for dragonbloods found here are
represented by the traditions of magic from which a
dragon is born.
Planar Scions: Duskwalker
A duskwalker isn’t born; they are instead created, each
manifesting as a mortal child in a location with close ties to
death. They embody the somber powers of the psychopomps,
immortal guardians and shepherds of the dead, and they
maintain a fascination with and deep understanding of death
throughout their lives. More singular than other versatile
heritages, duskwalkers don’t have different lineages.

41


## Duskwalker

Many call vampires the children of the night, but it’s
dhampirs who can truly claim that title. These mortal
offspring of vampires walk the line between life and
undeath not just physiologically, but also in their
social standing, temperament, and worldview. The
circumstances surrounding a dhampir’s birth are rare,
complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors. Some
dhampirs are the child of one mortal and one vampiric
parent, while others are born to those who were turned
into vampires while pregnant. Still others rise from
occult rituals or other supernatural influences that
impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant. The life
of a dhampir is often difficult; few vampiric parents
have the inclination to raise a mortal child, while mortal
communities find a dhampir’s sallow flesh, piercing eyes,
and unnerving presence off-putting at best.

## Dhampir

Despite being living creatures, dhampirs respond to
vitality and void energy as if they were undead, making
them unwelcome in many holy communities and often
driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs aren’t
immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals,
with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have
difficulty producing children of their own, and those few
born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves.
A dhampir generally resembles a member of their nonvampire
parent’s ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and
eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and
no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly
as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace,
beauty, and charm despite their unsettling appearance.
You might...
- Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to
blend into society or even hunting undead.
- Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to
“helpful” healing magic.
- Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste
of blood.
Others probably...
- Feel unsettled by your ghostly pallor and sharp teeth.
- Wonder about or even romanticize your origins
and motivations.
- Find themselves strangely drawn to your grace,
charm, and appearance.
Dhampir (Uncommon Heritage)
You are the scion of a vampire, half living and half
undead, gifted with uncanny charm and grace, a bloodless
pallor, and elongated incisors. You gain the dhampir trait,
in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You have
the void healing ability, which means you are harmed
by vitality damage and healed by void effects as if you
were undead. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain
darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision.
You can select from dhampir feats and feats from your
ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Dhampir Feats
The following feats are available to dhampir characters.
Lineages
Dhampir can select any of the following lineages.

## Straveika Feat 1


## Dhampir Lineage

You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu
cursed to eternal life but not eternal youth. People call you

straveika, or ancient-born. The vestiges of your forebear’s
powers of domination have left you with an understanding of
how a creature’s intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive and
Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you.

## Vampire Lore Feat 1


## Dhampir

You were raised by your vampiric parent, or you’ve invested
substantial time and energy researching the secrets of your
undead progenitors. You’re trained in Religion and Society. If

become trained in a skill of your choice.

of targets at 4th and 8th rank.

## Necromantic Physiology Feat 5


## Dhampir

Your unusual physiology has developed in a way that makes it
difficult for parasites and other infestations to prey upon you.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against
diseases. If you roll a success on a saving throw against
a disease, you get a critical success instead. If you have a
different ability that would improve the save in this way
(such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you roll a
critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

## Undead Slayer Feat 5


## Dhampir

Your knowledge of your own not-quite-living anatomy,
combined with your experience in combat, helps you take
down undead foes with ease. Against undead creatures,
you gain a circumstance bonus to damage with weapon and

for the Strike. This bonus increases to double the number of
weapon damage dice if your target has the vampire trait.

## 9Th Level

Dragons are powerful creatures, and many have
involved themselves deeply in the lives of others. Some
might be treated with reverence by a group of smaller
humanoids, acting as their protector or, in rare cases,
deity incarnate. Others take on a humanoid form to live
within a civilization as their neighbors’ equal, sometimes
hiding their true identity to observe or manipulate.
Whatever the dragon’s intent or actions during these
times, they leave an indelible impression on the people
they encounter, whether or not those people realize it. A
child may be born as the result of such an influence, and
these offspring are known as dragonbloods.
A dragonblood may be born from any ancestry and
found in just about any region of Golarion, as dragons
tend to go where they please. Some dragonbloods possess
obvious draconic traits, from clawed hands to leathery
wings to a mighty reptilian tail; these features always
resemble similar aspects of the dragonblood’s draconic
forebear. For instance, the scion of an adamantine

## Dragonblood

dragon might have thick, plate-like scales on their chest.
Other dragonbloods more closely resemble dragons than
the other half of their heritage, leading many to mistake
them for kobolds, iruxis, or other reptilian ancestries;
such dragonbloods who are proud of their draconic
lineage are quick to point out this mistake. There are
also those dragonbloods whose outward appearances
suggest only a hint of dragon blood. They might have
a barely noticeable sheen to their skin or the small
nubs of horns, but they often have an outsized force of
personality or innate magical abilities.
Areas in which dragons have more influence or cultural
significance see a higher population of dragonbloods
than other places. The countries of Tian Xia are often
referred to as the Dragon Empires due to the fact that
many dragons take active roles in local humanoid
societies. A leader in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings
who takes on a curse from killing a linnorm might
find that the eyes of their next offspring glow with an
eldritch light. Communities that pay homage to the
dragon gods Apsu or Dahak can also be blessed with
dragonblood births.
You might...
- Consider yourself quite courageous due to the
influence of your draconic heritage.
- Revel in the deference some other ancestries pay to
you and your ilk.
- Feel a burden of responsibility to live
up to the legacy of your ancestors.
Others probably...
- Believe you are in a dragon’s employ or are a dragon
in disguise and want you to reveal the location of
some treasure.
- Assume you can breathe fire or some other element.
- Mistakenly think touching your scales, horns, or
wings will bring them good luck.
Dragonblood (Uncommon Heritage)
You’re descended in some way from a dragon. Your
physical features might show this outwardly, with a pair
of draconic horns, patches of scaly skin, or even a tail, or
you might develop an internal reserve of draconic power.
You gain the dragonblood trait, in addition to the traits
from your ancestry. Add Draconic to your ancestry’s
list of additional languages (allowing you to choose
it as a language if your Intelligence modifier is
positive). When you roll a success on a saving throw
against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.
You can choose from dragonblood feats and feats from
your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

Dragonblood Feats
The following feats are available to dragonblood characters.
Lineages
Dragonblood can select any of the following lineages.
You can have only one lineage feat; you can select such
a feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out
of this feat.

## Arcane Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

You descend from a dragon that wields mastery of their
magical abilities, such as a fortune dragon or mirage dragon.
As such, you can instinctively grasp the intricacies of magic.
You gain the trained proficiency rank in Arcana. If you would
automatically become trained in Arcana (from your background
or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of
your choice. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. If you choose
a draconic exemplar, you must choose an arcane dragon.

## Divine Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

You can trace your lineage to a dragon with almost deific
powers, such as a diabolic dragon or empyreal dragon. You
are blessed with a small bit of divine protection. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Religion. If you would automatically
become trained in Religion (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
In addition, you are endowed quick reactions. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to initiative rolls. If you choose a draconic
exemplar, you must choose a divine dragon.

## Occult Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

Your blood contains a tiny fragment of unusual or inexplicable
power from a mysterious dragon, such as a conspirator dragon
or omen dragon. You are drawn to the stranger parts of the
world and can generally spot them with a glance. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Occultism. If you would automatically
become trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat. If you choose a
draconic exemplar, you must choose an occult dragon.

## Primal Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

A dragon with a deep connection to the natural world, such as
an adamantine dragon or a horned dragon, resides somewhere
on your family tree. You tend to trust your instincts and might
take on the role of a protector of the wilderness. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Nature. If you would automatically
become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You can use Nature to Sense Direction and Subsist in the
wilds. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose a
primal dragon.

## 1St Level

### Breath Of The Dragon [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Dragonblood Magical

Tapping into the physiology of your draconic ancestor, you
can exhale a torrent of energy in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot
line, dealing 1d4 damage. Each creature in the area must
attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your
class DC or spell DC. You can’t use this ability again for
1d4 rounds.
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage
increases by 1d4. The shape of the breath, the damage type,
and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar
(see above). This ability has the trait associated with the type
of damage it deals.

## Draconic Aspect Feat 1


## Dragonblood

You have an obvious draconic feature, such as sharp claws, a
snout full of sharp teeth, or strong reptilian tail, that you can
use offensively. You gain your choice of one of the following
unarmed attacks. The attack is in the brawling group and has
the listed damage die and traits.
- Claw 1d4 slashing (agile, finesse, unarmed)
- Jaws 1d6 piercing (forceful, unarmed)
- Tail 1d6 bludgeoning (sweep, trip, unarmed)
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat, nor can you change the type
of attack you gained.

## Draconic Exemplars

Some abilities reference your draconic exemplar, which is a
specific type of dragon from which you draw your draconic
powers—typically the type of dragon whose blood runs
in your veins. You can choose your exemplar when you
create your character, but are only required to choose one
when you select a feat or other option that requires you to
have one (such as Breath of the Dragon). This means your
draconic nature might be a mystery to you for some time.
The table below lists the dragons from Monster Core
and their specifications. The dragon breath entry lists if the
given breath uses a Fortitude (F), Reflex (R), or Will (W) saving
throw. If you choose a dragon from a different source, work
with your GM to determine if you have access to it.
Dragon Tradition Speeds Dragon Breath
Adamantine Primal Burrow Cone of bludgeoning R
Conspirator Occult Climb Cone of poison F
Diabolic Divine — Cone of fire R
Empyreal Divine — Cone of spirit R
Fortune Arcane — Cone of force R
Horned Primal Swim Cone of poison F
Mirage Arcane Climb Cone of mental W
Omen Occult — Cone of mental W

45


## Draconic Resistance Feat 1


## Dragonblood

Draconic magic safeguards you against harm. You gain
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage
type associated with your draconic exemplar. Double this
resistance against damage of that type dealt to you by dragons.
If your draconic exemplar is associated with bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage, instead of gaining resistance to
that type you can choose acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic.

## Draconic Sight Feat 1

You have a fraction of the senses of your draconic forebear.
You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already grants you low-light vision.

You’ve set your mind on learning more about your ancestor
and their kin, and perhaps you were even raised by a dragon
parent. You’ve come to understand how dragons can invoke
fear but also how they’ve contributed to society as a whole.
You gain the trained proficiency rank in Diplomacy and
Intimidation. If you would automatically become trained
in one of those skills (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your
choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Dragon Lore.

## Scaly Hide Feat 1


## Dragonblood

You were born with a layer of scales across your entire body
that resemble those of your draconic progenitor. When you’re
unarmored, the scales give you a +2 item bonus to AC with a
Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus to AC from these scales
is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer’s
clothing, the mystic armor spell, or bands of force (GM Core 286).

retrain into or out of this feat.

dragon. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. At their

Prerequisites Breath of the Dragon
Thanks to rigorous breathing exercises and a diet similar to that
of your lineage, your magical breath is more powerful. The area

60 feet for a line, and the damage dice are d6s instead of d4s.
TRUE DRAGON’S FLIGHT FEAT 9

ability to change their shape to walk among humanoids.
You have learned how to mimic this ability. You can cast

except that the duration is increased to 1 hour. The
spell’s tradition matches your draconic exemplar’s.
### Majestic Presence [one-action] FEAT 13

By taking an impressive stance, the full force of your
personality cows lesser beings. Each creature in a 20-
foot emanation must attempt a Will save against the

Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 4.

Dragonblood, Divine Dragonblood, Occult Dragonkin, or Primal
Dragonblood lineage feat, you can instead choose any dragon
of that tradition.

## Lingering Breath Feat 17


## Dragonblood

Prerequisites Breath of the Dragon
Your draconic breath destroys the surrounding environment
and leaves your enemies in pain. When you use Breath of
the Dragon, the area of your breath becomes difficult terrain
for 1 minute. In addition, a creature who fails or critically
fails its saving throw takes 2d6 persistent damage of the
same type.

## Divine Dragonblood

The first duskwalkers manifested as the result of a
bargain between two powerful psychopomps, the
immortal guardians and guides of souls after death. One
believed that souls who helped preserve the cycle of life
and death—but had their own lives cut short—deserved
reincarnation, while the other felt this would too greatly
violate that same cycle. In the end, duskwalkers rose
from a concession between the two psychopomps: such
rebirths could occur, but in limited frequency. Only a
finite number of duskwalkers ever exist at any one point
in time.
When a duskwalker perishes and faces final judgment,
a new one incarnates within a year from a deserving soul,
typically somewhere far from the previous duskwalker’s
birthplace. Duskwalkers manifest in locations with
a sanctified connection to death, such as graveyards

## Duskwalker

or temples, and begin their lives at adolescence. No
duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological
children, but this doesn’t prevent them from establishing
families, typically through adoption.
Duskwalkers have an inherent understanding of the
cycle of life and death. In most cases this manifests as a
deep respect for that cycle and pushes the duskwalker
toward occupations that help them to protect it, such as
hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.
You might...
- Seek out opportunities to form strong friendships
with a diverse array of companions.
- Become focused on preventing the spread of undeath.
- Be intrigued at finding your identity in a previous life.
Others probably...
- Assume you’re a necromancer or have some other
strange interest in death or the dead.
- Want to know if you remember your past life or ask
you about the secrets of death or the afterlife.
Duskwalker (Uncommon Heritage)
Thanks to an ancient bargain, your soul has been reborn
as a duskwalker, a planar scion with a connection to
psychopomps and the Boneyard. You gain the duskwalker
trait. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision
if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your
body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can
select from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry
whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Duskwalker Feats
The following feats are available to duskwalker characters.

## 1St Level

### Chance Death [reaction] FEAT 1

## Duskwalker Fortune

Frequency once per day
Trigger You would die as a result of a failed recovery check or
saving throw.
Your previous life ended due to sheer poor luck, struck
by lightning or choking on a fish bone. You can reroll the
triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you must use
the new result, even if it’s worse.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat.
### Deliberate Death [reaction] FEAT 1

## Duskwalker

Frequency once per day

Trigger You are about to gain the dying condition as a result
of another creature’s attack or ability, and that creature is
within your melee reach.
Once, you died because someone—murderer, monster, or soldier—
chose to strike you down. Just before losing consciousness,
make a melee Strike against the triggering creature.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat.

## Duskwalker Lore Feat 1


## Duskwalker

You either found another duskwalker who taught you the
secrets of your kind, or you managed to research your unusual
heritage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Medicine and
Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one of
those skills (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for
Boneyard Lore.
### Duskwalker Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 1

## Duskwalker

You have familiarity with the bo staff, longbow, composite
longbow, scythe, and staff—for the purpose of proficiency,
you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple
weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial
weapons.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## Ghost Hunter Feat 1


## Duskwalker

Your connection to the Boneyard ensures that your blows
strike true against spectral beings. Your weapon and unarmed
Strikes against incorporeal creatures become magical. If they
are already magical, they instead gain the effects of a ghost
touch property rune.

## Gravesight Feat 1


## Duskwalker

You can see in the darkness as easily as a psychopomp. You
gain darkvision.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat.

## 5Th Level


## Lifesense Feat 5


## Divine Duskwalker

You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your
psychopomp forebears. You gain lifesense as an imprecise
sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the
life force of living and undead creatures within the listed
range. The sense can distinguish between the vitality energy
animating living creatures and the void energy animating
undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.

## Spirit Soother Feat 5


## Duskwalker

You are attuned to the minute sounds and sensations of
restless spirits. Even if you aren’t Searching, you can attempt
a check to find haunts that normally require you to be
Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to
find the haunt. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks
to disable haunts.
### Ward Against Corruption  FEAT 5

## Duskwalker

Your soul is warded against the power of undeath and plague,
as well as that of the evil former psychopomps known as
sahkils. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against death effects, disease, and all effects from undead
or sahkils. This bonus increases to +2 against an undead or
sahkil’s death effect or disease.

## 9Th Level


## Duskwalker Magic Feat 9


## Duskwalker

Your connection to psychopomps gives you the power to
glimpse the near future and protect corpses from the ravages
of undeath. You can cast augury and peaceful rest each once
per day as 2nd-rank divine innate spells.

## Quietus Strikes Feat 9


## Duskwalker

Your connection to the Boneyard empowers you to bring death
to all forms of life and unlife, exploiting their weaknesses.
All your weapon and unarmed Strikes are magical and deal
1 additional void damage to living creatures and 1 additional
vitality damage to undead. The extra damage increases to 2 if
the Strike has a +3 potency rune.

## 13Th Level


## Resist Ruin Feat 13


## Duskwalker

Your duskwalker heritage allows you to extend protection
against void energy. You gain resistance 5 to void, and once
per day, you can cast false vitality as a 5th-rank divine
innate spell.

## 17Th Level


## Boneyard’S Call Feat 17


## Uncommon Duskwalker

You have a powerful connection to the Boneyard and its
courts, granting you the ability to travel to and from the
Boneyard. You can cast interplanar teleport as a divine innate
spell twice per week. This can be used only to travel to the
Boneyard or from the Boneyard to the Universe. Due to your
unique connection to the Boneyard, your body serves as the
locus, and you don’t require a planar key.

49

The following common backgrounds supplement those
found in Player Core and are available to any character
during character creation. Some of these backgrounds
grant skill feats from Chapter 4 of this book.

## Astrologer Background

Astrologers look to the stars for signs and portents, using
their positions in the heavens to chart courses for those living
beneath them. As the celestial spheres move, so does fate itself.
You studied the stars and learned to divine your path based on
their guidance. Whether the stars directly called you to a life of
adventure or you use the stars to guide your wanderlust, you’re
living out the stars’ guidance in a life of adventure.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Astrology Lore
skill. You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat.

## Barber Background

Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgery—if it takes a
steady hand and a razor, you can do it. You may have taken to
the road to expand your skills or test yourself against a world
that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Surgery Lore
skill. You gain the Risky Surgery skill feat (page 233).

## Bookkeeper Background

You ran the numbers on a large farm, for a merchant’s endeavors,
or with a major guild in the city. You kept track of expenses,
payroll, profits, and anything else that had to do with money,
for better or worse. If better, you might be adventuring to learn
how others ply this trade. If worse, you may be fleeing from
impending consequences in the hope that no one finds you.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Accounting Lore
skill. You gain the Eye for Numbers skill feat (page 230).

## Courier Background

In your youth, you earned coin running messages for persons
of wealth and influence, darting through crowded city streets.
Your dogged commitment to deliver your message was good
training for the life of an adventurer.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Lore skill for your
city of origin. You gain the Glean Contents skill feat (page 231).
Your character’s abilities don’t spring into existence at the moment they take up the
adventuring life. Their background—the role they had before they became an adventurer—
also provides a number of abilities.

## Common Backgrounds


## Driver Background

You practically live behind the controls of a vehicle and can
handle just about anything the road, waves, and sky can throw
at you. You likely adventure to test your skills in unusual
environments and new and interesting vehicles.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Dexterity, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill and the Piloting Lore
skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Piloting Lore.

## Insurgent Background

You were more than a rebel; you were a revolutionary, fighting
for the promise of a new or better country. You may or may
not still believe in the cause, or perhaps victory or exile has led
you on this new journey to trumpet your glory... or to escape
the consequences of your defeat.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Warfare Lore
skill. You gain the Lengthy Diversion skill feat.

## Outrider Background

In your youth, you galloped on horseback over vast prairies,
serving as a vanguard for your settlement, an army, or another
group. Seeing so many different lands built a thirst in you to
adventure and explore the world instead of just racing past it.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Nature skill and the Plains Lore skill.
You gain the Express Rider skill feat (page 230).

## Pilgrim Background

In your youth, you made several pilgrimages to important shrines
and sacred sites. You might have been a mendicant friar, a seller
of religious relics (real or fraudulent), or just a simple farmer
following the dictates of your faith. Whatever the aims of your
wanderings now, your faith still protects you on the road.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Religion skill and the Lore skill for your
patron deity. You gain the Pilgrim’s Token skill feat (page 232).

## Refugee Background

You come from a land very distant from the one you now find
yourself in, driven by war, plague, or simply in the pursuit of
opportunity. Regardless of your origin or the reason you left
your home, you find yourself an outsider in this new land.
Adventuring is a way to support yourself while offering hope
to those who need it most.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and a Lore skill related to
the settlement you came from. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.

## Root Worker Background

Some ailments can’t be cured by herbs alone. You learned
ritual remedies as well, calling on nature spirits to soothe
aches and ward off the evil eye. Taking up with adventurers
has given you company on the road, as well as protection from
those who would brand you a fake—or worse.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Herbalism Lore
skill. You gain the Root Magic skill feat (page 233).

## Saboteur Background

Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest
of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a
knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or
structure’s weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer
strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills
or complete a particular mission.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Dexterity, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Thievery skill and the Engineering Lore
skill. You gain the Concealing Legerdemain skill feat (page 228).

## Scavenger Background

You’ve made a living sorting through the things society throws
away. You might have scavenged simply to survive, or plied a
trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While you’ve left
that life behind, you still keep one eye on the ground out of habit.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and a Lore skill
for the settlement you grew up scavenging in.
You gain the Forager skill feat.

## Servant Background

You held a role of servitude, waiting on nobles and
engendering their trust as one of the confidantes of
the household. You might have walked away on good
terms, or perhaps you know dangerous secrets about
your former employers. Regardless, you’re adventuring
for a change and finding that in this new role, the skills you’ve
learned now serve you.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Labor Lore skill.
You gain the Read Lips skill feat.

## Squire Background

You trained at the feet of a knight, maintaining their gear and
supporting them at tourneys and in battle. Now you search for
a challenge that will prove you worthy of full knighthood, or
you’ve spurned pomp and ceremony to test yourself in honest,
albeit less formal, combat.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Constitution, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and your choice of the
Heraldry Lore or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Armor Assist
skill feat (page 227).

## Tax Collector Background

Reviled but required, you were sent when taxes were due.
Performing your job might have required travel and persuasion,
or perhaps you were responsible for collecting taxes on trade.
Either way, it sometimes meant dirty hands, and adventuring
seemed the next logical step to you.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Lore skill
for the settlement that employed you. You gain the Quick
Coercion skill feat.

## Ward Background

When you were young, you became the ward of another house—
boarded, fed, and educated, but never quite a part of the family.
Perhaps you had to tend to their needs in return for feeding and
raising you, or perhaps you were provided for but disregarded.
Now, adventuring is your chance to grow and roam free.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and the Genealogy
Lore skill. You gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat.

## Tax Collector'S Tools

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly
different roleplaying experience by setting their character
up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. Whether
a character with the royalty background is heir to the
throne of the kingdom where your campaign takes place
or to a distant but powerful nation in the same world,
the character is situated in a special position within the
narrative. Your character’s background is an intrinsic
part of where they come from and not something they
earn during the game. Rare backgrounds should be
chosen only after a discussion between the GM and
the other players as to whether one would apply for a
particular character in your group’s game.
Backgrounds can also be unique, such that no other
character can have them if your character does. To create
unique backgrounds, you can adapt the rare backgrounds
in this section by including more specific details.

## Amnesiac Background


## Rare

Your background is... well... honestly, you can’t remember! You
might have inklings deep within your mind, undercurrents of
unusual emotions or unexpected responses to certain people
or situations, but ultimately you don’t know who you once
were. You might be adventuring specifically to help discover
yourself. It’s up to you and the GM how to handle the truth of
your character’s backstory. You could leave it to the GM so it’s
a secret, work together with the GM, or even choose to leave
it undecided until later. In any case, you and your GM should
determine a few noteworthy details about your character or
their belongings to get the first clues to your past.
You gain three free attribute boosts. You choose two, and
the GM chooses the third based on their first inklings of your
character’s possible history.

## Blessed Background


## Rare

You have been blessed by a divinity. For an unknown reason,
and irrespective of your actual beliefs, a deity has granted
you a boon to use for good or ill. Your blessing grants wisdom
and insight to aid you in your struggles. You may or may not
even know the identity of the being who blessed you, and the
blessing might come with a cost you discover later on.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in a Lore skill associated with the deity who
blessed you (such as Shelyn Lore) if you know their identity,
or else in a Lore skill of the GM’s choice if you don’t. Either you
can cast guidance as a divine innate spell at will, or you gain a
similar blessing determined by the GM.
While most backgrounds are available to any character, some backgrounds are so unusual
that just having them makes a character rare and extraordinary.

## Rare Backgrounds


## Cursed Background


## Rare

You are the victim of a personal or hereditary curse. Through
great effort and occult study, you have learned to fend off
the curse’s worst effects and, by extension, you can protect
yourself against other harmful magic. However, the curse still
hangs over you and sometimes manifests in dangerous ways.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Occultism and Curse Lore. You gain the
Warding Sign reaction. You and the GM should determine the
full effects of the curse, though you’ve staved most of them off
for now. The GM determines the curse’s lingering manifestations
on you, which usually include at least a constant or very
frequent thematic effect and occasional more dangerous effects.
Warding Sign [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per minute;
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect,
but you haven’t rolled yet; Effect You call on the power of
a personal, eldritch sign of protection, which flares brightly
before slowly fading. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
the triggering saving throw, or a +3 circumstance bonus if
the effect is a curse.

## Feral Child Background


## Rare

You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps
raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with
these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though
this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.
Choose one attribute boost. It must be to Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution.
You are trained in Nature and Survival. You gain low-light vision
(or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise scent
with a range of 30 feet, and the Forager skill feat.

## Feybound Background


## Rare

You have spent time in the First World or another realm of
the fey and aren’t entirely the same person you were before.
Perhaps you made a purchase at the legendary Witchmarket
or partook deeply of fey food and wine. Whatever the case,
willingly or inadvertently, you made a bargain with the fey, the
benefits of which come at a price.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Fey Lore and gain the Fey’s Fortune free
action. You gain an anathema as part of your pact with the
fey. If you violate this anathema, you lose Fey’s Fortune until
you receive the effects of a successful atone ritual using the
Nature skill. The exact anathema is up to you and the GM, but

the most common requirement is that you must fulfill a single
request from any fey who knows your name.
Fey’s Fortune [free-action] (concentrate, fortune) Frequency once per
day; Trigger You attempt a skill check and haven’t yet rolled;
Effect Roll the skill check twice and use the better result.

## Haunted Background


## Rare

You are followed by a spirit or entity, either from childhood or
since a momentous event. You and others may have seen this
entity. You have studied esoteric subjects trying to understand
your situation, but this presence in your life remains a mystery.
Whatever this entity is or wants, it influences your life in subtle
ways, and not always for the better. Sometimes the entity helps
you, but at other times, its influence is malevolent or harmful.
The entity is most likely to surface in stressful situations.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Occultism and an additional skill in which
the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any
time you attempt a skill check for the entity’s skill, the GM can
offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the
entity were Aiding you. If you accept but fail the check, you
are frightened 2 (frightened 4 on a critical failure). The initial
frightened value can’t be reduced by effects that would reduce
or prevent the condition (such as a fighter’s bravery).

## Returned Background


## Rare

You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the
realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and
undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You gain the Diehard feat and the Additional Lore feat for
Boneyard Lore.

## Royalty Background


## Rare

You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have
eschewed the daily routines of royal life and taken up an
adventurous quest—perhaps you’re a deposed queen hoping
to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a
sovereign’s heir on a secret mission.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Society. You gain the Courtly Graces skill
feat and can influence commoners in your family’s territory,
as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the Leverage
Connections skill feat (page 232), you automatically have
common and noble connections within any community in your
royal family’s territory and have noble connections in large
communities outside your territory.

experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every
eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your
foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind
and body to their limits.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an alchemist. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent
your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.
Alchemy
You understand the reactions between all manner of
reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your
needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft
activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that
allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost.
Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items
for free, and since each of them becomes more and more
powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving
behind those who don’t understand your strange science.
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (Player Core
252), and you can automatically identify alchemical items
that you have the formula for.
Formula Book
An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item
they can create. You start with a standard formula book
for free (Player Core 288). The formula book contains the
formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of
your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from
Alchemical Crafting and your research field. The catalog
of alchemical items begins on page 281.
Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas
for two common alchemical items to your formula book.
These new formulas can be for any level of item you can
create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it’s also
possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements
or from other alchemists, or to select the Inventor skill
feat so you can invent them (Player Core 257).
As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when
Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don’t need to
learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the
1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create
a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of
life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites.
Items with type entries that have widely varied functions
require separate formulas, but most alchemical items
have a structure similar to elixir of life.
Advanced Alchemy
During your daily preparations, you spend some time to
create alchemical items that can be used over the course of
the day. You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this,
you can use an alchemist’s toolkit instead of an alchemist’s
lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically
required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials
requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items
up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in
your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than
your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have
the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your
next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
Versatile Vials
You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into
versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs

and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing
special reagents. During your daily preparations, you
can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your
Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum
number of vials. If you’re below your maximum number,
you can gather reagents from the environment around
you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration
mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn’t prevent you from
participating in other exploration activities.
Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed
if not used by the next time you make your daily
preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type
you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a
versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick
Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to
the ways you can use a vial.
You can store all your versatile vials within your
alchemist’s toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though
versatile vials are physical objects, they can’t be
duplicated or preserved in any way.
Quick Alchemy
You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items
you need on the fly.
### Quick Alchemy [one-action]

## Alchemist Manipulate

Requirements You’re either holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit (Player Core 287) and you have a free hand.
You can either use up a versatile vial to make another
alchemical consumable at a moment’s notice or create an
especially short-lived versatile vial. Any effect created by an
item made with Quick Alchemy that would have a duration
longer than 10 minutes lasts for 10 minutes instead.
- Create Consumable You expend one of your versatile
vials to create a single alchemical consumable item
of your level or lower that’s in your formula book.
You don’t have to spend the normal monetary cost
in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a
Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it
remains potent only until the start of your next turn.
(As normal, you need only one formula for an item to
create any level of that item.)
- Quick Vial You create a versatile vial that can be used
only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your
research field (it can’t be used to create a consumable, for
example). This item has the infused trait, but it remains
potent only until the end of your current turn.
Research Field
Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe
have led you to focus on a particular field of research.
At 1st level, you choose your research field. These appear
on pages 60–62. This choice gives you more formulas, a
special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and
other benefits as you level up.
Alchemist Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain an alchemist class feat. These begin on page 62.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Field Discovery 5th
You learn a discovery listed in your research field (page
60–62).

Research Field
You might have a degree from a scientific institute,

correspond with other researchers in your field, or work
as a genius loner. Choose a research field. The research
fields presented in this book are as follows.
Formulas Add these formulas to your formula book at 1st
level, in addition to your other formulas.
Field Benefit Your studies and experiments taught you a specific
technique, which varies widely from one field to another.
Field Vials This ability modifies how you can use versatile vials.
Field Discovery, Advanced Vials, Greater Field Discovery The
remaining entries list your field’s benefits for class features
you gain at higher levels, including the level at which you
typically gain them in parentheses.
Bomber
You specialize in explosions and other violent reactions.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical bombs.
Field Benefit When throwing an alchemical bomb with the
splash trait, you can choose to deal splash damage to only
your primary target instead of the usual splash area.
Field Vials When you Strike with a versatile vial, you can
choose to have it deal cold, electricity, or fire damage
instead of acid damage.
Field Discovery (5th) You have calculated all the angles to
maximize a bomb’s splash. When you throw an alchemical
bomb with the splash trait, you can cause the bomb to deal
splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
1) instead of the normal amount.
Advanced Vials (11th) You can mix special ingredients into your
vials, such as magical dust or flakes of precious minerals.
When you create a versatile vial, you can choose to have it
treated as one special material of your choice, chosen from
adamantine, cold iron, and dawnsilver. If you’re wearing or
wielding an item of a different precious material when you
make the vial, you can choose that material instead.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) You can increase the splash on
your bombs to damage creatures within 10 feet, or 15 feet if
you have Expanded Splash.
Chirurgeon
You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical elixirs with the
healing trait (like lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, or minor
elixir of life).
Field Benefit You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for
anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as
prerequisites) and use your Crafting modifier in place of your
Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks.
Field Vials Your versatile vials can be used to heal a living creature
a number of Hit Points equal to the vial’s initial damage. A
creature can drink the vial for this benefit, or you can throw
the vial at a willing creature within 20 feet as an Interact
action to heal that creature. In either case, a vial used this way
loses the acid and splash traits and gains the coagulant and
healing traits, plus the elixir trait if a creature drinks it.
Field Discovery (5th) Your medicinal elixirs are quite fortifying.
When a creature drinks an infused elixir with the healing
trait that you have created, that creature gains a number
of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 0); these temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.
Advanced Vials (11th) When you use a field vial to heal a
creature that has half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, the
coagulant trait doesn’t apply to that healing.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) When you use Quick Alchemy
to create any type of elixir of life, the creature healed by the
item regains the maximum Hit Points possible, instead of
rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.
Mutagenist
You focus on bizarre mutagenic transformations that
sacrifice one aspect of a creature’s physical or psychological
being in order to strengthen another.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical mutagens.
Field Benefit When you use a mutagen, you gain a number
of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 0) plus half your level. These temporary Hit
Points last for 1 minute or until the mutagen’s duration
expires, whichever comes first. You can’t gain temporary HP
from drinking a mutagen again for 1 minute.
Field Vials You can drink the contents of one your versatile
vials to suppress the drawback you take from one mutagen
currently affecting you until the beginning of your next
turn. A vial used this way loses the acid, bomb, and splash
traits and gains the elixir trait. If you have more than one
drawback due to Combine Elixirs or a similar ability, drinking
the vial suppresses one drawback of your choice.
Field Discovery (5th) The mutagens flowing through your

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many alchemist
class features and abilities.
Additive: Feats with the additive trait allow you to add
special substances to alchemical consumables you create
when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable
(you can’t use additives with quick vials). You can add
only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can
add an additive only once per round, and most additive
abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you
can add them to.
Coagulant: Healing alchemical items with the coagulant
trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short
period of time. If a creature heals Hit Points from an item
with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily
immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent items with
the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any
other effects of those items).
Infused: An alchemical item with the infused trait has a
limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent
effects from your infused alchemical items, with the
exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end
when you make your daily preparations again.

61

blood have altered your body chemistry. When you roll a
Fortitude save while affected by a mutagen and dislike the
result, you can end the effect of the mutagen to reroll the
save. This is a fortune effect.
Advanced Vials (11th) When you drink one of your field vials,
you also gain resistance to physical damage for the same
duration. The resistance is equal to half your level.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) If you imbibe another mutagen
while you are under the effects of a mutagen, you can gain
the benefits and the drawbacks of both mutagens at once,
despite the fact that they both have the polymorph trait and
would not normally function together. If you come under
the effects of any further mutagens while benefiting from
two mutagens, you lose the benefit of one of the former
mutagens of your choice, while retaining the drawbacks
of all the mutagens. If you are under the effects of two
mutagens and you come under the effect of a non-mutagen
polymorph effect, you lose the benefits of the mutagens
while retaining the drawbacks of both. Your field vial benefit
applies to one mutagen of your choice.
Toxicologist
You specialize in toxins and venoms of all types.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical poisons.
Field Benefit You can apply an injury poison you’re holding to
a weapon or piece of ammunition you’re wielding as a single
action, rather than as a 2-action activity. In addition, you
flexibly mix acidic and poisonous alchemical compounds.
Your infused poisons can affect creatures immune to
poison. A creature takes acid damage instead of poison
damage from your infused poisons if either the creature is
immune to poison or that would be more detrimental to the
creature (as determined by the GM). Typically, this benefit
applies when the creature has an immunity, resistance, or
weakness to one of the damage types.
Field Vials Your versatile vials have the poison trait and deal
poison damage instead of having the acid trait and dealing
acid damage (though your field benefit still applies). You
can apply the contents of a versatile vial to a weapon or
piece of ammunition as an injury poison. Add the versatile
vial’s initial damage to the first successful Strike with that
weapon or ammunition. The substance becomes inert at the
end of your current turn.
Field Discovery (5th) You have handled enough poisons to
become inured to their effects. You gain poison resistance
equal to half your level.
Advanced Vials (11th) When you damage a creature with a
versatile vial you’ve used as an injury poison, that creature
takes persistent poison damage equal to the vial’s splash
damage in addition to the initial damage.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) When a creature fails its initial
saving throw against an infused injury poison you created,
the wound sprays poison onto another creature adjacent
to it. The attacker who caused the injury chooses which
creature, if there’s more than one, and can choose to forgo
this effect. That creature is exposed to the poison. The
second creature doesn’t spread the poison further.

select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.

## 1St Level


## Alchemical Familiar Feat 1


## Alchemist

You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed
from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own
blood. You gain a familiar, which has the construct familiar
ability (Player Core 212); this is permanent, doesn’t require
the familiar to have the tough familiar ability, and doesn’t
count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2).
The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its
Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers.

## Alchemical Assessment Feat 1


## Alchemist

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the
Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy on an alchemical item you
hold, you can do so as a single action, rather than spending
10 minutes.

## Blowgun Poisoner Feat 1


## Alchemist

You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun. Your
blowgun Strikes can apply injury poisons even if they deal
no damage due to a creature’s resistance. If you critically
succeed at a blowgun Strike using a poisoned dart, the
target’s initial save against the poison is one degree of
success worse than the creature rolls; this is a misfortune
effect.
In addition, if you make a blowgun Strike while hidden
or undetected, you don’t automatically become observed.
Instead, immediately attempt a Stealth check against the
Perception DC of the target. If you succeed, you don’t
become observed, and are hidden (if you were undetected,
you still become hidden rather than remaining undetected).

## Far Lobber Feat 1


## Alchemist

You’ve learned how to throw a longer distance. When you
throw an alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30
feet instead of the usual 20 feet.
### Quick Bomber [one-action] FEAT 1

## Alchemist

You keep your bombs and bomb-related reagents in easy-toreach
pouches from which you draw without thinking. You
Interact to draw a bomb, draw a versatile vial, or use Quick
Alchemy to create a bomb, then Strike with the bomb. If you
have the ability to create more than one bomb at a time with
Quick Alchemy (such as from the double brew class feature),
you can Strike with only one of the bombs you create with
this action.

## Soothing Vials Feat 1


## Alchemist

Prerequisites chirurgeon research field
The healing chemicals in your versatile vials also help calm a
patient’s mind. When a living creature affected by a mental
effect regains Hit Points from one of your versatile vials, it can
immediately attempt a new Will saving throw to end one mental
effect of its choice. It gains a +1 item bonus to the saving throw.

## 2Nd Level


## Clotting Elixirs Feat 2


## Alchemist

Your restorative concoctions have a clotting effect on the drinker’s
blood. When a living creature drinks an infused elixir with the
healing trait that you have created, it can immediately attempt a
DC 10 flat check to remove any persistent bleed damage.
### Improvise Admixture [one-action] FEAT 2

## Alchemist Concentrate Manipulate

Frequency once per day
Requirements You have fewer than your maximum number
of versatile vials, and you’re either holding or wearing an
alchemist’s toolkit.
You scrounge together enough ingredients from what’s left in
your alchemist’s toolkit to produce a few more versatile vials on
the fly. Attempt a Crafting check. The DC is usually a standarddifficulty
DC for your level, but the GM can assign a different
DC based on the circumstances. The number of vials you regain
depends on the result of your check (up to your maximum).
Critical Success You regain 3 versatile vials.
Success You regain 2 versatile vials.
Failure You regain 1 versatile vial.
Critical Failure You don’t regain any versatile vials.

## Pernicious Poison Feat 2


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a toxic additive to an alchemical poison to make
it splash poison on its target. A poison with this additive deals

## Sample Formula Book

You can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items
for your formula book, but the list below contains a good
selection of starter formulas. A beginner’s book with these
formulas called The Fundamentals of Alchemy has become
popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away
from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has
drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling
alchemists away from more innovative experiments.
Alchemical Item Formulas: Alchemist’s fire, frost
vial, cheetah’s elixir, elixir of life, glue bomb, smoke ball;
Bomber Acid flask, bottled lightning; Chirurgeon Antidote,
antiplague; Mutagenist Bestial mutagen, cognitive mutagen;
Toxicologist Arsenic, giant centipede venom

63

an amount of poison damage equal to the poison’s level if the
target succeeds at its initial saving throw against it. A target
that critically succeeds at its saving throw against this poison
still takes no damage.
### Revivifying Mutagen [one-action] FEAT 2

## Alchemist Concentrate

Requirements You are under the effects of a mutagen.
You metabolize a mutagen to heal yourself. You regain 1d6 Hit
Points for every 2 item levels of the required mutagen (minimum
1d6 HP), but the mutagen’s duration immediately ends.

## Smoke Bomb Feat 2


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a tarry additive to an alchemical bomb to make
it emit smoke. When thrown, in addition to its normal effects,
the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot burst. You
choose which corner of the target’s space (or the space in
which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures
within that area have the concealed condition, and all other
creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute
or until dissipated by a strong wind.

## 4Th Level


## Efficient Alchemy Feat 4


## Alchemist

Thanks to the time you’ve spent studying and experimenting,
you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches that
don’t require any additional attention. Increase the number of
items you can create each day with advanced alchemy to 6 +
your Intelligence modifier.
In addition, when you Craft alchemical consumables during
downtime, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a
single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For
instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to
eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four.
This doesn’t change the amount of alchemical reagents or other
ingredients required to craft each item, nor does it change your
rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent.

## Enduring Alchemy Feat 4


## Alchemist

You’ve learned how to make your personal energy last just a
little bit longer when quickly brewing ad hoc concoctions. When
using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or elixir, that
tool or elixir remains potent until the end of your next turn,
instead of losing its potency at the start of your next turn.

## Healing Bomb Feat 4


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a foamy catalyst to an elixir of life to turn it into
a topical projectile. You can throw the elixir as though it were
an alchemical bomb, with the following results.
Success The target is affected as though it drank the elixir, and
each living creature adjacent to it regains HP from the bomb

## Chirurgeon

You use alchemy for medicinal purposes, healing and
protecting others across the lands.

equal to the elixir’s number of damage dice (3 HP for a lesser
elixir of life, for example).
Failure The target regains HP equal to the elixir’s number of
damage dice.
Critical Failure The healing bomb has no effect.

## Invigorating Elixir Feat 4


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix an aromatic salve into an elixir with the healing
trait to soothe physical maladies. In addition to its normal
effects, the elixir can be imbibed by a creature prevented from
doing so (such as a sickened creature). In addition to its other
effects, the elixir attempts to counteract an effect imposing
one of the following conditions of the imbiber’s choice: clumsy,
enfeebled, sickened, or stupefied. Use half your level rounded
up for the counteract rank and your class DC – 10 for the
counteract modifier. The imbiber is then temporarily immune
to the effects of this additive for 10 minutes. The additive can’t
counteract curses, diseases, or conditions that are part of the
creature’s normal state.
### Regurgitate Mutagen [one-action] FEAT 4

## Alchemist Manipulate

Requirements You are under the effects of a mutagen.
You redirect a mutagen within your body to spit a stream of
stomach acid at a foe. A creature within 30 feet takes 1d6
acid damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex
save against your class DC. On a failure, the creature is also
sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on a critical failure). The mutagen’s
duration immediately ends.

## Tenacious Toxins Feat 4


## Alchemist

Your victims tend to expire long before your poisons, since
the latter have been specifically formulated to last longer. The
maximum duration of any poison you create increases by an
amount equal to the poison’s stage 1 interval, to a maximum of
twice the poison’s maximum duration.

## 6Th Level


## Combine Elixirs Feat 6


## Additive Alchemist

You can add the full ingredients of a second elixir to an elixir you
make to create a hybrid concoction. You must expend an additional
versatile vial to make this combined elixir, and the ingredients
must be for an elixir you could create with Quick Alchemy. When
this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs
take effect. For example, you can combine two lesser elixirs of life
to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or
you can combine a lesser darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye
elixir to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.

65


## Debilitating Bomb Feat 6


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a crystalline additive to an alchemical bomb to
have it undermine your enemy. Choose dazzled, deafened, offguard,
or a –5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with
the bomb hits, in addition to the bomb’s normal effects, the
target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take that
effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for
this saving throw, even if someone else throws the bomb.

## Directional Bombs Feat 6


## Alchemist

You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle
the splash in a cone that sprays in a single direction, potentially
allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines.
When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead
of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can create a
splash in a 15-foot cone. You choose the cone’s direction, but its
first square must be a square in the target’s space.
Special If you have the Expanded Splash feat or another ability
that increases the radius of splash damage, you can have the
splash damage be a 20-foot cone.

## Fortified Elixirs Feat 6


## Alchemist

Your treatments for diseases and poisons can be very
efficacious, though they tend not to last as long. A creature
that is under the effect of an infused antidote or antiplague
that you created can choose to reroll a failed Fortitude saving
throw against an appropriate affliction (poison for antidote and
disease for antiplague). The creature doesn’t gain the elixir’s
usual item bonus to the reroll, and after the reroll, the elixir’s
duration immediately ends. This is a fortune effect.

## Sticky Poison Feat 6


## Alchemist

A combination of additional viscosity and careful application
keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant
wear and tear. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon would
expend its poison without your target attempting an initial
save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure,
for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your
weapon remains poisoned. If your Strike with a poisoned
weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success,
your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.

## 8Th Level


## Alter Admixture Feat 8


## Alchemist Exploration

Requirements You are holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit.
Sometimes, you need to adapt your alchemical mixtures
to new situations. In a process that takes 10 minutes, you
change an item you created with advanced alchemy into
a similar item. You can change an alchemical bomb into

another type of alchemical bomb, an elixir into another type
of elixir, or a poison into another type of poison. If it’s unclear
whether two alchemical consumables are similar, the GM
decides. You must know the formula for the new item, and
the new item must be of the same or lower item level than
the original item. The new item still keeps the infused trait,
and it remains potent as long as the original item would have.
### Improved Invigorating Elixir  FEAT 8

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Invigorating Elixir
Choose physical invigoration or mental invigoration, and add
the listed conditions to those you can choose for an invigorating
elixir you create to counteract: Physical Invigoration blinded,
deafened, drained, paralyzed, slowed; Mental Invigoration
confused, controlled, fleeing, frightened, paralyzed, slowed.
Special You can select this feat a second time to choose a
different type of invigoration and add its options to those
you can choose.

## Mutant Physique Feat 8


## Alchemist

Basic mutagens that affect your physical form can bring out
the beast within you, turn you nigh invincible, or make your
body more elastic. While you’re affected by one of the listed
mutagens, you get an additional benefit.
- Bestial Mutagen You gain the mutagen’s item bonus to
your Intimidation checks. In addition, you increase the
damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step, and
they gain the deadly d10 trait.
- Juggernaut Mutagen You gain resistance to all physical
damage equal to half your level.
- Quicksilver Mutagen You can stretch your legs and
Step up to 10 feet, and you can squish and compress
your body, allowing you to make it through tight spaces
as if you were one size smaller, in addition to any effect
from Squeezing.
Special If you can be under the effects of multiple mutagens
(with the mutagenist greater field discovery, for example),
you get all relevant benefits.

## Pinpoint Poisoner Feat 8


## Alchemist

Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your
poisons. When you successfully Strike an off-guard creature
with a poisoned weapon or expose an off-guard creature to an
inhaled poison, that creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty
to its initial save against that poison.

## Sticky Bomb Feat 8


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix in a sticky additive to an alchemical bomb to make
its contents adhere and continue to deal damage. A creature
hit by a sticky bomb also takes persistent damage equal to and
of the same type as the bomb’s splash damage. If the bomb
already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts.

## 10Th Level

### Advanced Efficient Alchemy  FEAT 10

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Efficient Alchemy
You make an even-larger batch of alchemical items each
morning. Increase the maximum number of items you can
create with advanced alchemy to 8 + your Intelligence modifier,
or to 10 + your Intelligence modifier if you’re 16th level or higher.

## Expanded Splash Feat 10


## Alchemist

You can throw bombs at just the right trajectory to create
especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw
an alchemical bomb and that bomb has the splash trait, you
can have the splash damage affect all creatures within 10 feet
of the target instead of 5 feet. If you do, you gain a status
bonus to the bomb’s splash damage equal to your Intelligence
modifier. If you have the bomber 5th-level field discovery, this
additional damage applies even if you caused your bomb to
deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier instead
of the normal amount, allowing your bombs to deal splash
damage equal to double your Intelligence modifier.
### Greater Debilitating Bomb  FEAT 10

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Debilitating Bomb
You have learned enhanced techniques and alchemical secrets
that allow you to expand the range of effects you can impose
with your bombs. When you use Debilitating Bomb, add the
following to the list you can choose from: clumsy 1, enfeebled
1, stupefied 1, or –10-foot status penalty to Speeds.

## Unstable Concoction Feat 10


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix a wondrous yet volatile liquid into an alchemical
consumable if it has an initial effect that uses dice. You
increase the size of any dice for the item’s initial effect by one
step. For instance, you could increase damage from a moderate
alchemist’s fire to 2d10 or healing from a moderate elixir of life
to 5d8+12. Because this affects only initial dice, it wouldn’t
increase unarmed attack damage from a bestial mutagen,
persistent damage from an acid flask, and the like. When this
item is activated, the creature activating it must succeed at a
DC 10 flat check or take acid damage equal to the item’s level.

## 12Th Level


## Extend Elixir Feat 12


## Alchemist

Integrating your own personal energy into the elixirs you create
causes them to affect you for longer. When you consume one
of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits
and a duration of 1 minute or longer, that elixir’s duration is
doubled. If you created the item with Quick Alchemy, this can’t
cause it to exceed the 10-minute duration limit.

67

### Supreme Invigorating Elixir  FEAT 12

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Invigorating Elixir
For the purposes of counteracting effects with invigorating
elixirs, treat your level as though it were 2 higher. Add the listed
conditions to those you can choose for an invigorating elixir you
create to counteract: petrified, stunned. You can also choose a
disease regardless of what, if any, conditions it imposes.

## Uncanny Bombs Feat 12


## Alchemist

Prerequisites Far Lobber
You lob bombs unerringly, despite obstructions or distance. When
you throw an alchemical item with the bomb trait, its range
increment increases to 60 feet, you reduce any circumstance
bonus to the target’s AC from cover by 1, and you automatically
succeed at the flat check when targeting a concealed creature.

## 14Th Level


## Double Poison Feat 14


## Alchemist

You can apply two different infused injury poisons to the same
weapon, though not to a piece of ammunition. Each poison’s
level must be 2 or more levels lower than your level. You have
to apply the two poisons individually. Once you’ve applied both,
the poisons merge into a double poison that uses the lower of
the two poisons’ DCs and number of stages. This double poison
is virulent only if both poisons were virulent. Combine the
effects of each stage of the poison on any creature affected by
it. For each stage of the poison, use the effects of both poisons
and the longer interval for that stage among the two poisons.

## Mutant Innervation Feat 14


## Alchemist

Basic mutagens that affect your mind and thoughts can make you
communicate telepathically, protect you from being detected, or
let you communicate with anyone. While you’re affected by one
of the listed mutagens, you get an additional benefit.
- Cognitive Mutagen You also gain the mutagen’s item
bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Medicine,
Nature, Performance, Religion, and Survival checks.
In addition, you can communicate telepathically with
creatures within 60 feet with whom you share a language.
The communication is two-way once you establish it, so a
creature you contact can also communicate with you.
- Serene Mutagen Detection, revelation, and scrying
effects of 9th rank (or 17th level) or lower detect nothing
from you or your possessions and auras. For instance,
detect magic would still detect other magic in the area,
but not any magic on you.
- Silvertongue Mutagen Ignore circumstance penalties you
would take to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and
Performance checks. In addition, your words transcend
linguistic barriers; everyone listening to you speak hears
your words as if you were speaking in their own language

## Mutagenist

You transform yourself and others with mutagens.
Attributes
Prioritize Intelligence and Strength. Constitution helps
you survive transformations and combat, and Wisdom
helps keep your mind intact despite the warping.

(though you don’t actually speak that language, nor does this
ability allow you to understand any additional languages).
Special If you can be under the effects of multiple mutagens
(with the mutagenist greater field discovery, for example),
you get all relevant benefits.
### True Debilitating Bomb  FEAT 14

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Greater Debilitating Bomb
You have discovered increasingly devastating ways for your
bombs to impede your foes. When you use Debilitating Bomb,
add the following to the list of effects you can choose from:
enfeebled 2, stupefied 2, or a –15-foot status penalty to Speeds.

## 16Th Level


## Eternal Elixir Feat 16


## Alchemist

Prerequisites Extend Elixir
Your body readily accepts and retains minor changes. When
you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and
infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or more, you can
make the elixir’s duration indefinite. You can do so only if the
elixir’s level is half your level or lower. If you later consume a
different elixir and make it indefinite, the effect of the previous
indefinite elixir ends.

## Exploitive Bomb Feat 16


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix a refractile substance into an alchemical bomb to
foil resistances. Choose one damage type the bomb can deal.
Any damage dealt by the bomb—including initial, splash, and
persistent damage—ignores an amount of that resistance equal
to your level.

## Persistent Mutagen Feat 16


## Alchemist

Prerequisites Extend Elixir
You’ve trained your physical form to remain stable. Once per
day, when you consume an alchemical item with the infused
and mutagen traits, you can extend its duration to last until
the next time you make your daily preparations instead of
its normal duration. Unlike with the normal extension from
Extend Elixir, this can exceed the duration of an item created
with Quick Alchemy beyond its normal 10-minute limit.

## 18Th Level


## Improbable Elixirs Feat 18


## Alchemist

Your mastery of alchemical secrets enables you to replicate effects
most believe can be achieved only via magic. Select a number of
potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); these
potions must be of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to
create these potions as alchemical consumables with the elixir
trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute
alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components,
and you can use an alchemist’s toolkit (for Quick Alchemy) or
an alchemist’s lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other
required toolkits. Other than that, the formula doesn’t change.
Once you’ve chosen the potion formulas, they can’t be changed.

## Miracle Worker Feat 18


## Alchemist

Frequency once every 10 minutes
Your alchemical mastery can resuscitate the recently slain.
You can administer a major or true elixir of life to a creature
who has been dead for no more than 2 rounds. When you do,
that creature is immediately returned to life with 1 Hit Point
and becomes wounded 1.

## Perfect Debilitation Feat 18


## Alchemist

You have perfected the formulas for bombs that impede your
enemies. When you use Debilitating Bomb, your target avoids
the condition the bomb imposes only if it critically succeeds at
its saving throw.

## 20Th Level


## Alchemical Revivification Feat 20


## Alchemist

If you die while under the effect of at least one elixir, the
alchemical compounds in your bloodstream bring you back to
life at the start of your next turn. You’re affected by an elixir
of rejuvenation (page 288), then a true elixir of life, then your
choice of a major bestial mutagen, major juggernaut mutagen,
or major quicksilver mutagen as though you just imbibed it.
These automatic reactions don’t get any special benefits you
add when creating or using these items. Because you died, all
other alchemical compounds in your bloodstream are inert.
After being revived, you’re temporarily immune to Alchemical
Rejuvenation for 1d4 hours.
CRAFT PHILOSOPHER’S STONE FEAT 20

## Alchemist

Your research has paid off, culminating in the legendary
philosopher’s stone. You learn the formula for the philosopher’s
stone (page 295) and can add it to your formula book.

## Mega Bomb Feat 20


## Additive Alchemist Manipulate

You can add a highly explosive additive to an alchemical
bomb to turn it into a mega bomb. Throwing this bomb takes
a 2-action activity instead of a Strike. This isn’t a Strike, and
you don’t make an attack roll. The mega bomb explodes in
a 30-foot burst within 60 feet. It deals damage as if each
creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save. On
a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect
a primary target (such as off-guard from bottled lightning).
Though all targets in the area take splash damage as primary
targets, there is no further splash beyond that area.

69

Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful
weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability
without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon
a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part
of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a
nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their
rage only when it matters most.

## Barbarian

Trained in barbarian class DC
During combat encounters...
You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way
through. Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they
can exploit your relatively low defenses.
During social encounters...
You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion
can’t get the job done.
While exploring...
You look out for danger, ready to charge headfirst into battle in an instant.
You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow,
and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the
water’s surface. If something needs breaking, you’re up to the task!
In downtime...
You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your
mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.
You might...
- Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.
- Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.
- Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness.
Others probably...
- Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold
your own in a fight.
- See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.
- Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent
until the fight is done.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a barbarian. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get
four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an
attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two
boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must

by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of
this class.
Rage
You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.
### Rage [one-action]

## Barbarian Concentrate Emotion Mental

Requirements You aren’t fatigued or raging.
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a
number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your
Constitution modifier. While you are raging:
- You deal 2 additional damage on melee Strikes. This
additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed
attack is agile.
- You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless
they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.
Rage lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or
until the encounter ends, whichever comes first. You can’t
voluntarily stop raging. When you stop raging, you lose any
remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and can’t gain
temporary Hit Points from using the Rage action again for
1 minute.
Quick-Tempered
You gain the Quick-Tempered free action, which lets
you Rage at the slightest provocation.
### Quick-Tempered [free-action]

## Barbarian

Trigger You roll initiative.
Requirements You are not encumbered or wearing heavy
armor.
So long as you are able to move freely, your fury is instinctive
and instantaneous. You Rage.
Instinct
Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you
learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you.
Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid
certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and
resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats
tied to your instinct. For more information, see Instincts
on page 74.
Barbarian Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
barbarian class feat. These begin on page 77.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill feat. Skill feats have the skill trait. You must be
trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a
skill feat.
Furious Footfalls 3rd
The urge to fight drives you ever forward. You gain a +5-
foot status bonus to your Speed. This bonus increases to
+10 feet while you’re raging.

General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you
gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
thereafter.
Brutality 5th
Your fury makes your weapons lethal. Your proficiency
ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and
unarmed attacks increase to expert. While raging,
you have the critical specialization benefits for melee
weapons and unarmed attacks.
Juggernaut 7th
Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for
Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success
instead.
Weapon Specialization 7th
Your rage helps you hit harder. You deal an additional
2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which
you have expert proficiency. This damage increases to 3
if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. You gain
your instinct’s specialization ability.
Raging Resistance 9th
Repeated exposure and toughened skin allow you to
fend off harm. While raging, you gain resistance equal
to 3 + your Constitution modifier to damage types based
on your instinct.
Reflex Expertise 9th
You’ve developed a knack for dodging danger. Your
proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Mighty Rage 11th
Your rage intensifies and lets you hit harder at the start
of a fight. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian
class DC increases to expert. In addition, when you use
Quick‑Tempered, the first Strike you make during your first
turn deals additional damage equal to your Rage damage.
Greater Juggernaut 13th
You have a stalwart physiology. Your proficiency rank
for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you
roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a
failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Fortitude
save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the
damage you take.
Medium Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
Weapon Mastery 13th
Your rage makes you even more effective with the weapons
you wield. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons,
martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.
Greater Weapon Specialization 15th
The weapons you’ve mastered become truly fearsome in
your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization
increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in
which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if
you’re legendary. You gain a greater benefit from your
instinct’s specialization ability.
Indomitable Will 15th
Your rage makes it difficult to control you. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Perception Mastery 17th
Your instinct heightens each of your senses further. Your
proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.
Revitalizing Rage 17th
Your rage sustains you more frequently, leaving you
ready to jump into battle anew. Instead of needing to
wait 1 minute before you can gain temporary Hit Points
from Rage again, you need only to spend at least one full
turn not in a Rage.
Armor Mastery 19th
Your training and rage deepen your connection to your
armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium
armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.
Devastator 19th
Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care
about resistance, and your barbarian abilities are
unparalleled. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian
class DC increases to master. Your melee Strikes ignore
up to 10 resistance to the physical damage they deal.

73

Instincts
You channel your rage through an instinct. You decide
what your instinct means to you. It could be a creature or
symbol beloved by your clan, or a purely internal source or
filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, heritage, or state
of mind. Each instinct includes the following. Your choice
of instinct also serves as a prerequisite for many feats.
Instinct Ability You gain this fundamental ability related to
your instinct.
Specialization Ability (7th) You get this benefit when you gain
the weapon specialization class feature at 7th level.
Raging Resistance (9th) You get this benefit when you gain
the raging resistance class feature at 9th level.
Animal Instinct
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage,
granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that
revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give
rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also
be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of
your personality, or you might be a descendant of a
werewolf or another werecreature. Select an animal
from the Animal Instincts table that best matches your
chosen animal.
Instinct Ability—Bestial Rage While raging, you gain your
chosen animal’s unarmed attack (or attacks), but you’re
unable to use weapons. The specific attack gained, the
damage it deals, and its traits are listed in the Animal
Instincts table. These attacks are in the brawling group.
Your Rage action gains the morph and primal traits.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage die size for
the unarmed attacks granted by your chosen animal by
one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage
from 2 to 5 for your chosen animal’s unarmed attacks.
If you have greater weapon specialization, increase the
damage from Rage from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal’s
unarmed attacks.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist piercing and slashing damage.

## Animal Instincts

Animal Attack Damage Traits
Ape Fist 1d10 B Grapple, unarmed
Bear Jaws 1d10 P Unarmed
Claw 1d6 S Agile, unarmed
Bull Horn 1d10 P Shove, unarmed
Cat Jaws 1d10 P Unarmed
Claw 1d6 S Agile, unarmed
Deer Antler 1d10 P Grapple, unarmed
Frog Jaws 1d10 B Unarmed
Tongue 1d4 B Agile, unarmed
Shark Jaws 1d10 P Grapple, unarmed
Snake Fangs 1d10 P Grapple, unarmed
Wolf Jaws 1d10 P Trip, unarmed
Dragon Instinct
You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and
manifest incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture
reveres draconic majesty, or you gained insights by
drinking or bathing in dragon’s blood or watching
a marauding wyrm burn your village. Select a
type of dragon from the Dragon Instincts table
as your instinct’s dragon type. These are the
dragons from Monster Core, but your GM
might allow you to choose dragons from other
sources and determine their tradition and
dragon breath type.
Instinct Ability—Draconic Rage While raging,
you can increase the additional damage from Rage
from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to match
that of your instinct’s dragon breath instead of the

damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do
this, your Rage action gains the trait matching your dragon
instinct’s tradition, as well as the trait matching the damage
type where applicable.
Specialization Ability (7th) When you use draconic rage, you
increase the additional damage from Rage from 4 to 8. If
you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase
the damage from Rage when using draconic rage from 8
to 16.
Raging Resistance You resist piercing damage and the damage
type of your instinct’s dragon breath.

## Dragon Instincts

Dragon Tradition Dragon Breath
Adamantine Primal Bludgeoning
Conspirator Occult Poison
Diabolic Divine Fire
Empyreal Divine Spirit
Fortune Arcane Force
Horned Primal Poison
Mirage Arcane Mental
Omen Occult Mental
Fury Instinct
Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well
within you. You use your rage as you choose.
Instinct Ability—Unstoppable Frenzy Increase the additional
damage from Rage from 2 to 3. You gain a bonus 1st-level
barbarian feat.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the additional damage
from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater weapon
specialization, instead increase the additional damage from
Rage to 13.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist physical weapon damage,
but not physical damage from other sources (such as
unarmed attacks).
Giant Instinct
Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant.
This doesn’t necessarily mean you revere giants—you
might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You
could instead seem like a giant to other people due to
your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions
and ego.
Instinct Ability—Titan Mauler You can use a weapon built for
a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally
and when raging). If you’re not Small or Medium, you can
use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you.
You start with one such weapon, which you receive for free.
It must be a common melee or ranged weapon, it must have
a Price of 9 gp or less (not including the Price adjustment
for being a larger weapon), and it must be common or you
must otherwise have access to it. It is your personal weapon
and has no value if sold unless you later add runes to it,
and it has the normal Bulk for a weapon of its size (Player
Core 270).
When wielding a larger weapon in combat, increase your
additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have
the clumsy 1 condition because of the weapon’s unwieldy
size. You can’t remove this clumsy condition or ignore its
penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage from Rage
when using a larger weapon from 6 to 10; if you have
greater weapon specialization, increase it from 10 to 18.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist bludgeoning damage and
your choice of cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain
raging resistance.
Spirit Instinct
Whether you are emotionally sensitive to the spirits
around you; worship ancestors or apparitions; or are
haunted by the specter of an ancestor, relative, friend, or
foe, your rage takes the form of a spiritual possession.
Instinct Ability—Spirit Rage While raging, you can increase
the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 3 and change its
damage type to spirit, instead of the damage type for your
weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time you Rage). If
you choose to deal spirit damage, your weapon or unarmed
attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune,
which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures,
and your Rage action gains the divine and spirit traits.
Specialization Ability (7th) When using spirit rage, increase
the damage from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater
weapon specialization, instead increase the damage when
using spirit rage to 13.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist void damage, as well
as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of undead
creatures, regardless of the damage type.
Superstition Instinct
A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and counter
the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters. Whether
you’re a member of a superstitious family or culture
that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant battle against
wizards and witches, a survivor of a magical accident
that instilled an intense aversion in your mind and body,
or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance,
your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an
excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of
magical arts.

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many barbarian
class features.
Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special
techniques that require too much exertion for you to
perform frequently. You can use only one action with the
flourish trait per round.
Rage: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage
trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.

Instinct Ability—Superstitious Resilience Your deep
superstition means it’s anathema for you to learn or Cast
a Spell, or to wield or use an item that can be activated
to Cast a Spell. If you violate this anathema, you lose
the instinct’s abilities and any feats that list the instinct
as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime
re-centering yourself, though you keep all your other
barbarian abilities.
While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves
against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from 2
to 3, or 4 against creatures you have witnessed Casting a
Spell within the last hour. When you Rage, you regain Hit
Point equal to the temporary HP you gained from the Rage
action; you then can’t regain HP in this way again for 10
minutes. While raging, if you willingly accept the effects
of a magic spell or effect, you are frightened 1. You cannot
reduce your frightened condition below 1 as long as you
are affected by the spell or effect.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage from Rage
from 3 to 7, or 8 against creatures you have witnessed
Casting a Spell within the last hour. If you have greater
raging specialization, instead increase the damage from
Rage to 13, or 16 against creatures you have witnessed
Casting a Spell within the last hour.

Barbarian Feats
At every level that you gain a barbarian feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level


## Acute Vision Feat 1


## Barbarian

When you are raging, your visual senses improve, granting
you darkvision.

## Adrenaline Rush Feat 1


## Barbarian Rage

In the heat of battle, you are capable of amazing feats of
strength. While you are raging, increase your encumbered and
maximum Bulk limits by 2; you also gain a +1 status bonus to
Athletics checks to lift heavy objects, Escape, and Force Open.

## Draconic Arrogance Feat 1


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites dragon instinct
Few can sway you from your goals while the fury of combat
fills you. While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to saving
throws against emotion effects.
### Moment Of Clarity [one-action] FEAT 1

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

You push back your rage for a moment in order to think
clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with
the concentrate trait even if those actions don’t have the
rage trait.

## Raging Intimidation Feat 1


## Barbarian

Your fury fills your foes with fear. While you are raging, your
Demoralize and Scare to Death actions (from the Intimidation
skill and an Intimidation skill feat, respectively) gain the rage
trait, allowing you to use them while raging. As soon as you
meet the prerequisites for the skill feats Intimidating Glare
and Scare to Death, you gain these feats.

## Raging Thrower Feat 1


## Barbarian

Thrown weapons become especially deadly in your fury.
You apply the additional damage from Rage to your thrown
weapon attacks. If you have the Brutal Critical feat or the
devastator class feature, apply their benefits to thrown
weapon attacks.
### Sudden Charge [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Barbarian Flourish

With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride
twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least
one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy.
You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying,
or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.

## 2Nd Level


## Acute Scent Feat 2


## Barbarian

When your anger is heightened, your sense of smell improves.
While you’re raging, you gain imprecise scent with a range of
30 feet.
### Bashing Charge [two-actions] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Flourish

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You smash, bust, and charge through solid obstacles without
hesitation. Stride twice. Once during your movement, if your
movement passes through or ends adjacent to a door, window,
fence, wall, or similar obstacle, you can attempt an Athletics
check to Force Open the obstacle with a +1 circumstance bonus
to the roll; on a failure, your movement ends at that obstacle.
### Furious Finish [one-action] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Rage

Desperate to finish the fight, you pour all your rage into one
final blow. Make a Strike. If it hits, you gain a circumstance
bonus to damage equal to the number of rounds remaining
in your Rage (maximum 10). After this Strike, your Rage
immediately ends, and you are fatigued until you rest for at
least 10 minutes.
### Intimidating Strike [two-actions] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Emotion Fear Mental

Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their
confidence. Make a melee Strike. If you hit and deal damage,
the target is frightened 1, or frightened 2 on a critical hit.
### No Escape [reaction] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Rage

Trigger An enemy within reach attempts to move away
from you.
You keep pace with a retreating foe. Stride up to your Speed,
following the enemy and keeping it in reach throughout its
movement until it stops moving or you’ve moved your full
Speed. You can use No Escape to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim
instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.

## Second Wind Feat 2


## Barbarian

You can enter a second rage, but afterward you need to
catch your breath. When you Rage, you can choose to gain

77

temporary HP from the Rage even if 1 minute hasn’t passed
(or a full turn if you have the revitalizing rage class feature).
If you do, once this Rage ends you become fatigued until you
rest for 10 minutes.
### Shake It Off [one-action] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

You concentrate on your rage, overcoming fear and fighting
back sickness. Reduce your frightened condition value
by 1, and attempt a Fortitude save to recover from the
sickened condition as if you had spent an action retching;
you reduce your sickened condition value by 1 on a failure
(but not on a critical failure), by 2 on a success, or by 3 on
a critical success.

## 4Th Level

### Barreling Charge [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Flourish

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe. You
Stride, attempting to move through your enemies’ spaces, and
make a melee Strike. Roll an Athletics check and compare the
result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space you
attempt to move through during your Stride, moving through
its space on a success but ending your movement before
entering its space on a failure. You can use Barreling Charge to
Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride, as long as you
have the corresponding movement type.
### Oversized Throw [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements You have one or more hands free.
With a great heave, you seize a piece of your surroundings,
such as a boulder, log, table, wagon, or chunk of earth, and
hurl it at your foes. The object must be your size or one
size smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk
for you to lift it in the first place. Make a ranged Strike with
the object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same
amount of damage it would deal on a success. The object is a
simple ranged weapon that deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage,
has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon
trait. The damage increases to 2d10 if you have weapon
specialization in simple weapons, or 3d10 if you have greater
weapon specialization.

## Raging Athlete Feat 4


## Barbarian

Prerequisites expert in Athletics
Physical obstacles can’t hold back your fury. While you are
raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to
your land Speed, and the DC of High Jumps and Long Jumps
decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical Leap increases
to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap
increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, and to 20
feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
### Scars Of Steel [reaction] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites fury instinct
Frequency once per day
Trigger An opponent critically hits you with an attack that
deals physical damage.
When you are struck with the mightiest of blows, you can
flex your muscles to turn aside some of the damage. You gain
resistance to the triggering attack equal to your Constitution
modifier plus half your level.
### Spiritual Guides [reaction] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Fortune

Prerequisites spirit instinct
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail, but don’t critically fail, a Perception check or
a skill check.
Though no one sees them and only you can hear them, the
spirits around you constantly chatter, save when you are
raging. Sometimes they’re even helpful, and their guidance can
even cut through the haze of your rage. Reroll the triggering
check, using the second result even if it’s worse.

## Supernatural Senses Feat 4


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites Acute Scent or scent
Your scent is preternaturally sharp, and you can always rely
on your sense of smell to help guide you when your vision
is compromised. When you target a concealed or hidden
opponent while you are raging, you reduce the DC of the flat
check to 3 for a concealed target or to 9 for a hidden one.
### Swipe [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Flourish

You make a wide, arcing swing. Make a single melee Strike
and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two
enemies, each of whom must be within your melee reach and
adjacent to the other. Roll damage only once and apply it to
each creature you hit. A Swipe counts as two attacks for your
multiple attack penalty.
If you’re using a weapon with the sweep trait, its modifier
applies to all your Swipe attacks.
### Wounded Rage [reaction] FEAT 4

## Barbarian

Trigger You take damage and are capable of entering a rage.
You roar in pain, awakening the rage within you. You Rage.

## 6Th Level


## Animal Skin Feat 6


## Barbarian Morph Primal

Prerequisites animal instinct
Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert.
When you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms
into a thick hide. You gain a +2 item bonus to AC (+3 if you

have the greater juggernaut class feature). The thickness of
your hide gives you a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of
+3. This item bonus to AC is cumulative with armor potency
runes on your explorer’s clothing, mystic armor, and bands
of force.

## Brutal Bully Feat 6


## Barbarian

Prerequisites expert in Athletics
You push your foes around and leave bruises. While raging,
when you successfully Disarm, Grapple, Reposition, Shove,
or Trip an enemy, you deal that enemy bludgeoning damage
equal to your Strength modifier; add this to the damage from
a critical success to Trip.
### Cleave [reaction] FEAT 6

## Barbarian Rage

Trigger Your melee Strike reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points,
and another enemy is adjacent to that creature.
You swing clear through one foe and into another. Make a
melee Strike against the second enemy.
DRAGON’S RAGE BREATH [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

Prerequisites dragon instinct
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You breathe deeply and exhale powerful energy in a 30-foot
cone, dealing 1d6 damage per level to each creature in the area
with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage
type matches your instinct’s dragon breath (page 75), and this
action gains the trait of your dragon instinct’s tradition.
GIANT’S STATURE [one-action] FEAT 6

## Barbarian Polymorph Primal Rage

Prerequisites giant instinct
Requirements You are Medium or smaller.
You grow to incredible size. You become Large, increasing your
reach by 5 feet and gaining the clumsy 1 condition until you
stop raging. Your equipment grows with you.

## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites superstition instinct
Requirements You’ve seen the target Cast a Spell.

79

You use your hatred of magic to lash out at a known
spellcaster. Make a melee Strike against the required
creature. If you hit and deal damage, the target is stupefied
1, or stupefied 2 on a critical hit, until the beginning of your
next turn.

## Nocturnal Senses Feat 6


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites low-light vision or scent
Your senses gain even greater clarity. While raging, if you have
low-light vision you gain darkvision, and if you have scent the
range of your imprecise scent increases to 60 feet.
### Reactive Strike [reaction] FEAT 6

## Barbarian

Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action
or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee
Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is
a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you
disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your
multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty
doesn’t apply to this Strike.
### Scouring Rage [free-action] FEAT 6

## Barbarian

Prerequisites an instinct that allows you to change your
additional damage from Rage to a different damage type
Trigger You Rage.
You emit a powerful surge of instinctual energy when
you unleash your anger. Each enemy within 20 feet takes

your class DC) of the same type as your additional damage
during that Rage.

a different trait each time you use Animalistic

The animal within you breaks free, turning you into a
feral creature of nature when you rage. You follow your
instincts rather than reason, and you find yourself at

+2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks for attack actions.

## Instinctive Strike Feat 8


## Barbarian

Prerequisites Acute Scent or scent
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all your
senses to pinpoint your opponent’s location. When you make
a melee Strike against an opponent you’re detecting using
scent, ignore any flat check required due to the target being
concealed or hidden.

## Invulnerable Rager Feat 8


## Barbarian

Even the heaviest armors serve only to enhance your unbridled
fury. You are trained in heavy armor. Whenever you gain a

heavy armor. If you have the Quick-Tempered action, you can
use it while wearing heavy armor.
### Renewed Vigor [one-action] FEAT 8

Points last until the end of your rage.
### Share Rage [one-action] FEAT 8

## Auditory Barbarian Rage Visual

Requirements You haven’t used this ability since you last
Raged.
You stoke an ally’s fury. While you are raging, one willing

added benefits from your instinct, feats, or the like.
### Sudden Leap [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Barbarian

You swing at a foe while mid-leap. Make a Leap, High Jump, or
Long Jump and attempt one melee Strike at any point during
your jump. Immediately after the Strike, you fall to the ground
if you’re in the air, even if you haven’t reached the maximum
distance of your jump. If the distance you fall is no more than
the height of your jump, you take no damage and land upright.
When attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a
Sudden Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and
increase your maximum distance to double your Speed.
### Thrash [one-action] FEAT 8

## Barbarian Rage

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

You open yourself to attacks so you can respond in turn. Until
your rage ends, you are off-guard, and damage rolls against

creature is off-guard to you until the end of your next turn. If
you hit it before the end of your next turn, you gain temporary
Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier, or double that
on a critical hit. These temporary Hit Points last until the end
of your rage.
FURIOUS SPRINT [two-actions] OR [three-actions] FEAT 10

## Barbarian Rage

You rush forward. Stride up to five times, or up to eight times
if you used 3 actions. All this movement must be in a straight
line (though the GM might allow reasonable variance). You can
replace any of these Strides with a Balance action if you need
to, which you attempt using an Athletics check instead of an
Acrobatics check, using the same DC.

81


## Great Cleave Feat 10


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites Cleave
Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When
you Cleave, if your Strike also reduces its target to 0 HP, you
can continue to make melee Strikes until you make a Strike
that doesn’t reduce a creature to 0 HP, or until there are no
creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked
while Cleaving, whichever comes first.
### Impressive Landing [reaction] FEAT 10

## Barbarian

Trigger You fall at least 10 feet and land on a solid surface.
You slam into the ground, shattering it around you. Treat the
fall as 10 feet shorter. You land on your feet. The ground in a
5-foot emanation becomes difficult terrain. Any creature in
the emanation when you land takes 5 bludgeoning damage
as the debris hits it and is off-guard until the start of its
next turn.
### Knockback [one-action] FEAT 10

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements Your last action was a successful Strike.
The weight of your swing drives your enemy back. You push
the enemy back 5 feet, with the effects of a successful Shove.
You can follow the enemy as normal for a successful Shove.

## Overpowering Charge Feat 10


## Barbarian

Prerequisites Barreling Charge
You trample your foes as you charge past them. When you use
Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature’s
space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your
Strength modifier. If you critically succeed, the creature takes
double this amount of damage and becomes off-guard until the
end of your next turn.
### Resounding Blow [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
bludgeoning damage.
You strike your enemy in the head with such force that its ears
ring. Make a melee Strike. If the Strike hits and deals damage,
the target is deafened until the start of your next turn (or for 1
minute on a critical hit).
### Silencing Strike [one-action] FEAT 10

## Barbarian Incapacitation Rage

A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent.
Make a melee Strike against an enemy. If it hits, the enemy
must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It’s
stunned 1 and its speech is raspy and hard to understand.
It must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to use linguistic
actions or Cast a Spell, unless the spell has the subtle trait.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is stunned 3
instead of stunned 1.
### Tangle Of Battle [reaction] FEAT 10

## Barbarian Rage

Trigger You critically hit an adjacent enemy.
Your vicious strike pulls your foe closer, giving you
the opportunity to grab them. Attempt to Grapple the
triggering enemy.
### Terrifying Howl [one-action] FEAT 10

## Auditory Barbarian Rage

You unleash a terrifying howl. Attempt Intimidation checks
to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet: you don’t take a
penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language.
Regardless of the results of your checks, each target is then
temporarily immune to Terrifying Howl for 1 minute.

## 12Th Level

DRAGON’S RAGE WINGS [one-action] FEAT 12

## Barbarian Morph Rage

Prerequisites dragon instinct
You sprout dragon wings from your back of the same color
as your chosen dragon. While you are raging, you gain a fly
Speed equal to your land Speed. If you are flying when your
rage ends, you start to fall, but your transformation doesn’t
revert until the last moment, so you take no damage from the
fall and land standing up. This action gains the trait of your
dragon instinct’s tradition.
### Embrace The Pain [reaction] FEAT 12

## Barbarian Rage

Trigger A creature within your reach damages you with a
melee attack.
Ignoring your pain, you reach out and grab the creature or
weapon that caused you harm. Attempt an Athletics check to
Grapple the triggering creature or to Disarm the creature of
the weapon it damaged you with.
### Furious Grab [one-action] FEAT 12

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements Your last action was a successful Strike, and
either you have a hand free or your Strike used a weapon
with the grapple trait.
You grab your foe while it’s distracted by your attack.
The enemy you hit becomes grabbed by you, as if you had
succeeded at an Athletics check to Grapple it.
PREDATOR’S POUNCE [one-action] FEAT 12

## Barbarian Flourish Rage

Prerequisites animal instinct
Requirements You are unarmored or wearing light armor.
You close the distance to your prey in a blur, pouncing on the
creature before it can react. You Stride up to your Speed and
make a Strike at the end of your movement.

SPIRIT’S WRATH [one-action] FEAT 12

## Attack Barbarian Concentrate Rage

Prerequisites spirit instinct
You call forth an ephemeral spirit, typically the apparition of
an ancestor or a nature spirit, which takes the form of a wisp.
The wisp makes a melee wisp rush unarmed attack against
an enemy within 120 feet of you. The wisp’s attack modifier
is equal to your proficiency bonus for martial weapons plus
your Strength modifier plus a +2 item bonus, and it applies
the same circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that
you have. On a hit, the wisp deals spirit damage equal to 4d8
plus your Constitution modifier. Don’t apply your Rage damage
or your weapon specialization damage, but circumstance and
status bonuses and penalties that would also affect the wisp’s
damage apply. On a critical hit, the wisp deals double damage
and the target becomes frightened 1. This attack uses and
counts toward your multiple attack penalty as if you were the
one attacking.
### Sunder Spell [two-actions] FEAT 12

## Attack Barbarian Concentrate Rage

Prerequisites superstition instinct
You draw upon your superstitious fury to destroy a spell.
Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack
against a creature, object, or a spell manifestation (such as
the wall created by wall of fire or the guardian from spiritual
guardian). If you’re targeting something that doesn’t have
an AC listed, its AC against this Strike is usually 10 for
targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC
determined by the GM. If your Strike hits, you can attempt to
counteract a single spell or magical effect on the target. Your
counteract rank for this attempt is equal to half your level
rounded up, and you use the result of your attack roll for the
counteract check.
Whether or not you succeed at your Strike, the target
becomes temporarily immune to your Sunder Spell for
24 hours.

## Titan’S Stature Feat 12


## Barbarian

Prerequisites Giant’s Stature
You grow to even greater size. When using Giant’s Stature,
you can instead become Huge (increasing your reach by 10
feet if you were Medium or smaller).
### Unbalancing Sweep [three-actions] FEAT 12

## Barbarian Flourish

You make a great sweep with your weapon or fists about
yourself, knocking creatures off their feet and away from
you. Choose up to three enemies within your reach and
choose whether to Shove or Trip all three of them. Whichever
of the two options you choose, roll a separate Athletics check
against each enemy, performing the same action against each
enemy. Each attempt counts toward your multiple attack
penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have made
all the attempts.

## 14Th Level


## Awesome Blow Feat 14


## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

Prerequisites Knockback
Your attacks are so powerful, they can flatten your opponents.
When you use Knockback, you can attempt an Athletics check
against your target’s Fortitude DC.
Critical Success You gain the critical success effect of a
Shove, then the critical success effect of a Trip against the
target.
Success You gain the success effect of a Shove, then the
success effect of a Trip against the target.
Failure You gain the normal effect of Knockback.
GIANT’S LUNGE [one-action] FEAT 14

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

Prerequisites giant instinct
You extend your body and prepare to attack foes outside
your normal reach. Until your rage ends, all your melee
weapons and unarmed attacks gain a reach of 10 feet. This
doesn’t increase the reach of any weapon or unarmed attack
that already has the reach trait, but it does combine with
abilities that increase your reach due to increased size, such
as Giant’s Stature.
### Impaling Thrust [two-actions] FEAT 14

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
piercing damage.
You impale your enemy and hold it in place with your weapon,
and leave it bleeding when it gets free. Make a melee Strike
with a melee weapon that deals piercing damage. If the
Strike hits and deals damage, your target is grabbed until
it successfully Escapes, you attack with the weapon again,
or you Release the required weapon, whichever comes first.
When the target is no longer grabbed, it takes persistent
bleed damage equal to the weapon’s number of weapon
damage dice.

## Sunder Enchantment Feat 14


## Barbarian

Prerequisites Sunder Spell
You can focus your superstition to break the magic of an item,
in addition to destroying freestanding spells and those active
on creatures. When you Sunder a Spell, you can instead
attempt to counteract either an unattended magic item or
one of your target’s magic items. If your counteract attempt
succeeds, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for
10 minutes. If you target an artifact, an intelligent item, or a
similarly particularly powerful item, your counteract attempt
automatically fails.
### Vengeful Strike [reaction] FEAT 14

## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites Come and Get Me

83

Trigger A creature within your reach succeeds at an attack
against you.
Requirements You’re under the effect of Come and Get Me.
When struck by an enemy, you respond in turn. Make a melee
Strike against the triggering creature. If the triggering attack
was a critical success, you can use Vengeful Strike as a free
action instead of a reaction.
### Whirlwind Strike [three-actions] FEAT 14

## Barbarian Flourish

You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike against
each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts
toward your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase your
penalty until you have made all your attacks.

## 16Th Level


## Collateral Thrash Feat 16


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites Thrash
You smack the foe you’re thrashing into someone else. When
you Thrash, choose another enemy adjacent to the grabbed
enemy. That enemy also takes your Thrash damage, with a
basic Reflex save against your class DC.
### Desperate Wrath [free-action] FEAT 16

## Barbarian Rage

Trigger Your turn begins, and your current Hit Points are at
half your maximum or less.
Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw
caution to the wind to finish the fight. You get a +2
circumstance bonus to attack rolls, a –1 penalty to AC,
and a –1 penalty to saves. These bonuses and penalties
last until your Rage ends or until you are above half
Hit Points, whichever comes first.
### Dragon Transformation [one-action] FEAT 16
### Barbarian Concentrate Polymorph Primal Rage
Prerequisites Dragon’s Rage Wings
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You transform into a ferocious Large dragon, gaining the
effects of 6th-rank dragon form except that you use your
own AC and attack modifier, you apply your extra damage
from Rage, and the Dragon Breath action uses your class
DC. Add the temporary Hit Points from dragon form to any
you already have from entering a rage (or any other action
with the rage trait). The action to Dismiss the transformation
gains the rage trait.
At 18th level, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your fly
Speed, your damage bonus with dragon Strikes increases to
+12, and you gain a +14 status bonus to your Dragon Breath
damage.
### Furious Vengeance [reaction] FEAT 16

## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites fury instinct

## Fury

You keep things simple, because you need only one thing
to drive you: your own inner rage.
Attribute Scores
Prioritize your Strength, then your Constitution and
Dexterity. Wisdom can make you more perceptive.
Skills
Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Stealth
Instinct
Fury instinct
Starting Feat
Sudden Charge
Higher-Level Feats
Furious Finish (2nd), Scars of Steel (4th), Reactive Strike
(6th), Whirlwind Strike (14th)
Sample Barbarian

Trigger An enemy within your melee reach critically hits you
with a melee Strike.
Your enemy’s blow fuels your rage and provokes your
immediate retaliation. Make a melee Strike against the
triggering enemy.
### Penetrating Projectile [two-actions] FEAT 16

## Barbarian Flourish Rage

Requirements You are wielding a ranged or thrown weapon
that deals piercing damage.
Your projectiles are unhindered by flesh and bone. Make a
ranged Strike with a ranged or thrown weapon that deals
piercing damage against each creature in a 30-foot line (this
uses only one projectile despite the number of Strikes). These
Strikes ignore all cover granted by creatures. Roll damage only
once and apply it to each creature you hit. Each attack counts
toward your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase your
penalty until you have made all your attacks.

## Shattering Blows Feat 16


## Barbarian Rage

Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you are
raging, damage from your melee Strikes ignores the first 5
Hardness of an object. If you have the devastator class feature,
the damage instead ignores the first 10 points Hardness of an
object.

## 18Th Level


## Brutal Critical Feat 18


## Barbarian

Your critical hits are particularly devastating. On a critical
hit with a melee Strike, add one extra damage die. This is in
addition to any extra dice you gain if the weapon is deadly or
fatal. The target also takes persistent bleed damage equal to
two damage dice.
### Perfect Clarity [reaction] FEAT 18

## Barbarian Concentrate Fortune Rage

Trigger You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save.
You burn out all your rage to ensure that your attack lands and
your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or Will
save with a +2 circumstance bonus, and use the better result.
You then immediately stop raging.
### Vicious Evisceration [two-actions] FEAT 18

## Barbarian Rage

You make a vicious attack that maims your enemy. Make a
melee Strike. If the Strike hits and deals damage, the target is
drained 1, or drained 2 on a critical success.
### Whirlwind Toss [two-actions] FEAT 18

## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites Collateral Thrash
You whirl a foe to smash into all nearby creatures before
throwing them far away. You Thrash. During this Thrash, your
Collateral Thrash feat applies to all other enemies adjacent to
you. You can then throw the grabbed creature 10 feet, where
they fall prone.
If the enemy you choose for Collateral Thrash is also
adjacent to you, it attempts only one save and takes the
damage only once.

## 20Th Level

### Annihilating Swing [two-actions] FEAT 20

## Barbarian

You have embraced brute destructive power. You make a
melee Strike that ignores any resistances the target has. If
you target a solid unattended object or surface with your
Strike, you might automatically destroy it without an attack
roll. If you target any object or surface with Hardness 20
or less that isn’t a magic item or the effect of a spell, you
destroy it.
If the target object or surface is a magic item or the effect of
a spell, you attempt to counteract it using your attack bonus
with the Strike for the counteract check. Your counteract
rank is 10th. On a successful counteract check, you destroy
the object or surface unless it has Hardness greater than 20,
in an artifact, or is similarly difficult to destroy.
You destroy up to a 5-foot cube of an object or surface
larger than Medium.

## Contagious Rage Feat 20


## Auditory Barbarian Rage Visual

Prerequisites Share Rage
You can drive your allies into a frenzy, granting them incredible
benefits. You can ignore the requirements of Share Rage, using
it multiple times in a Rage. Allies affected by Share Rage can
choose to gain your instinct ability and the specialization
ability it gains from weapon specialization, but not greater
weapon specialization. They must abide by any restrictions
of your instinct if they do so (such as the anathema of the
superstition instinct).
### Quaking Stomp [one-action] FEAT 20

## Barbarian Manipulate Rage

Frequency once per 10 minutes
You stomp the ground with such force that it creates a minor
earthquake, with the effects of the earthquake spell (Player
Core 327).

## Unstoppable Juggernaut Feat 20


## Barbarian

You have become a brutal, unstoppable force of nature, able to
shrug off mortal wounds with ease. You gain resistance equal to
3 + your Constitution modifier to all damage, and your resistance
from raging increases to 8 + your Constitution modifier.
In addition, if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points while raging,
you can end your rage as a reaction to stay at 1 Hit Point. If
you do, you become wounded 2 (or increase your wounded
condition by 2 if you are already wounded).

85

You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up a weighty
mantle, and you devoutly pursue a cause that holds you apart from those around
you. You have powerful defenses that you share freely with your allies and innocent
bystanders, as well as divine power you use to end the threats your deity opposes.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a champion. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Deity
As a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity
you revere above all others. The most common deities in
Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along
with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get
for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.
Skill
You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity.
As normal, if you’re already trained in that skill, you
become trained in a different skill of your choice.
Anathema
Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they
take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any
implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these
are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the
other players at the table—you’re still playing a nuanced
character, not strictly following a script.
Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals
are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells,
committing acts, and using items that are anathema to
your deity remove you from your deity’s good graces.
Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema
to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your
connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a
ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma,
the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema
don’t appear in any deity’s formal list. For borderline cases,
you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.
If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your
deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your
connection to your deity. The class features that you lose
are determined by the GM, but they likely include your
holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing
of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you
repent by conducting an atone ritual (Player Core 390).
If your deity doesn’t require the specific sanctification you
had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and
cause (page 89) while still following the same deity.
Sanctification
Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you
holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle
over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither
will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.
If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity’s
sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you “must
be” holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the
deity lists “none,” you can choose only options that don’t
require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy
and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the
previous trait until you atone.
Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely
disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character
option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where

the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy
sanctification and causes are uncommon options.
Holy: You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any
Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not knowingly
harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent
if your direct intervention could save them” and the
anathema “Commit murder.” Even if your game includes
behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline (Player Core 397),
the acts listed there are anathema to you.
Unholy: You gain the unholy trait and add that trait
to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not put
another’s needs before your own or those of your deity”
and the anathema “Commit an entirely altruistic act, such
as giving something away in charity” and “Put anyone’s
needs before those of your deity.” None of these prevents
you from performing acts others might consider helpful,
but these acts must be done with the expectation that they
ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity.
Deific Weapon
You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s an
unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon,
increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8
to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain
access to it, and if it’s an advanced weapon, you treat it as a
martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency.
Champion’s Aura
You’re surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It
has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity
within the aura immediately knows you’re a champion
of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your
champion’s reaction and for various other effects. You can
suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has
the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious.
Cause
You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity’s name.
Some causes are limited to certain sanctifications. Your
cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a
special protective reaction called your champion’s reaction.
The following champion causes are on pages 91–93.
Desecration (Unholy): You selfishly corrupt and destroy.
Grandeur (Holy): You exemplify the glory and splendor
of the celestial realms.
Iniquity (Unholy): You destroy, take advantage, and act
with dishonor.
Justice: You follow laws and mete out just punishment.
Liberation: You oppose tyranny and fight for freedom.
Obedience: You enforce hierarchies and order.
Redemption (Holy): You try to redeem those who
commit wicked deeds.
Devotion Spells
Your deity’s power grants you special divine spells called
devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. Choose
one of the spells appearing on page 256, either shields of
the spirit or a spell based on your deity’s divine font (lay
on hands if your deity allows heal, touch of the void if
your deity allows harm).
It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you
gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of
1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily
preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10
minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or
do service toward their causes.
Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting
attribute is Charisma.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells.
The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is
equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never
be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear
on page 298 of Player Core.
Champion Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a champion class feat. These begin on page 93.
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (Player Core 262),
a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Blessing of the Devoted 3rd
Your deity blesses your service with a boon. This might
come in the form of a spirit that visits you and inhabits
your items or body, a mysterious divine tattoo upon your
body, or the like. Choose one of the following blessings, or
any other to which you have access.
Blessed Armament: Select one weapon or handwraps
of mighty blows. You gain that armament’s critical
specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property
rune of your choice from the following list: fearsome, ghost
touch, returning, shifting, or vitalizing. During your daily
preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different
armament, grant a different rune, or both.
Blessed Shield: In your hands, a shield gains the minor
reinforcing rune. As you go up in level, the shield gains
the reinforcing rune of your level (lesser at 7th level,
moderate at 10th level, greater at 13th level, major at
16th level, and supreme at 19th level). If your shield
already has the appropriate reinforcing rune for your
level, or if it’s a sturdy shield of the same level as the
appropriate reinforcing rune, the shield’s Hardness
instead increases by 1.
Blessed Swiftness: You gain a +5-foot status bonus to
Speed. If you’re mounted, your mount gains the bonus

89

instead. In addition, when the movement of one of your
allies triggers an enemy’s reaction while the ally is in your
champion’s aura, the ally gains a +2 status bonus to all
defenses against that reaction.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in,
or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which
you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Weapon Expertise 5th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies
of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase
to expert.
Armor Expertise 7th
You have spent so much time in armor that you know
how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency
ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for
unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor
specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.
Weapon Specialization 7th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with
the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional
damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in
which you’re an expert. This damage increases to 3
if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.
Champion Expertise 9th
Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your
proficiency ranks for your champion class DC, spell
attack modifier, and spell DC increase to expert.
Reflex Expertise 9th
You’ve developed a knack for dodging danger. Your
proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Relentless Reaction 9th
Your champion’s reaction improves, typically to
punish the attacker with spiritual backlash. It gains
the relentless reaction benefit listed in your cause
below your champion’s reaction.
Sacred Body 9th
The power of your deity keeps your body safe
from harm, as true an edifice of the faith as a
great temple. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
Divine Will 11th
Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

Exalted Reaction 11th
Your champion’s reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing
them to benefit as well. When you use your champion’s
reaction, you also get the effect listed for its exalted reaction.
Perception Expertise 11th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Armor Mastery 13th
Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more
blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy
armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.
Weapon Mastery 13th
You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency
ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed
attacks increase to master.

with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.

spells. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC,

well as for unarmored defense, increase to legendary.
Hero’s Defiance 19th

You gain the hero’s defiance devotion spell (page 257).
Causes
You have one of the following causes. Some are limited
to sanctification, as noted in parentheses. Your cause adds
to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special
reaction called your champion’s reaction, which appears
after the divider, along with its upgrades if you gain the
relentless reaction and exalted reaction class features at
higher levels.
Edicts and Anathema You gain any edicts or anathema listed.

You’re dishonorable, dishonest, and committed to
breaking the false hopes of kindness.

## Key Terms

damages, grabs, or restrains your ally, and both are in your
champion’s aura; Effect You free an ally from restraint. If the
trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance
to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your
level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing,
restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either
attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a
save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action.
Whether or not it needed to escape, the ally can then Step as
a free action if it’s able to move.
Relentless Reaction (9th Level) You punish those who ensnare
your allies. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to
make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed
when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent
spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Exalted Reaction (11th Level) In addition to the ally affected by
Liberating Step, you and all other allies in your champion’s aura
can Step as a free action. You and your allies gain the benefit
even if the ally who benefited from Liberating Step can’t move.
Obedience
Society is ordered with good reason, and people should
conduct themselves as appropriate for their proper place.
Edicts enforce proper hierarchies, topple illegitimate hierarchies,
lead when you’re the most suited to the task
Anathema let one who is lesser than you wield power over you
or lead you
Iron Command [reaction] (champion, divine, emotion, mental) Trigger An
enemy in your champion’s aura damages you; Effect You put
an impertinent foe who dared harm you in their proper place.
You command your enemy to kneel before you in obedience.
If they dare to refuse, they must pay the price in pain and
anguish. The enemy must choose one of the following options.
- Kneel The enemy drops prone as a free action.
- Refuse You deal 1d6 mental damage to the enemy. This
damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th level, 4d6
at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.
Regardless of which option the enemy chose, your
Strikes against it deal 1 extra spirit damage until the end
of your next turn. This extra damage increases to 2 at 9th
level and 3 at 16th level.
Relentless Reaction (9th Level) If the enemy refuses, it takes
persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Exalted Reaction (11th Level) Each enemy in your champion’s
aura other than the triggering creature must also either drop
prone or take mental damage (each enemy chooses). These
creatures take only minimum damage (typically 3 damage at
11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at 16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects
they take can’t be adjusted by anything that changes your
Iron Command. For instance, the Iron Repercussions feat
couldn’t turn the damage into persistent mental damage for
creatures other than the triggering creature.
Redemption (Holy)
Yearning for all to live in harmony, you make every attempt
to redeem those others might slay or dismiss.
Edicts try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds, show
compassion to others regardless of their authority or station
Anathema kill a sapient enemy without first offering a chance
at redemption
Glimpse of Redemption [reaction] (champion, divine) Trigger An enemy
damages your ally, and both are in your champion’s aura;
Effect Your enemy hesitates under the weight of sin as visions
of redemption play in their mind’s eye. The enemy must choose
to repent or refuse, with the following effects. If the enemy is
mindless or otherwise unable to repent, use the refuse result.
- Repent The ally is unharmed by the triggering damage.
- Refuse The ally gains resistance to all damage against
the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the
damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes enfeebled 2
until the end of its next turn.
Relentless Reaction (9th Level) If the enemy refuses, it takes
persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Exalted Reaction (11th Level) If the enemy refuses, you can
choose to grant the resistance to yourself and all allies in
your champion’s aura, including the triggering ally. If you do,
the resistance is reduced by 2 for all.
Champion Feats
At each level that you gain a champion feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level


## Brilliant Flash Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites grandeur cause
Your light cleanses souls of fear. When you use Flash of
Grandeur, the attacker is also off-guard for 1 round.
### Defensive Advance [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Champion Flourish

With the protection of your shield, you dive into battle! You
Raise your Shield and Stride. If you end your movement within
melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike
against that enemy. You can use Defensive Advance while
Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if
you have the corresponding movement type.

## Deity’S Domain Feat 1


## Champion

You embody an aspect of your deity. Choose one of your deity’s
domains. (The main deities of Golarion and their domains appear
on pages 35–39 of Player Core.) You gain the domain’s initial
domain spell as a devotion spell.
### Desperate Prayer [free-action] FEAT 1

## Champion

Frequency once per day
Trigger You begin your turn and have no Focus Points.
You call out to your deity in a plea for their aid. You gain 1 Focus

93

Point, which you can spend only to cast a devotion spell. If you
don’t spend this Focus Point by the end of this turn, it is lost.

## Faithful Steed Feat 1


## Champion

You gain the service of a young animal companion as a mount.
See Animal Companions (Player Core 206). If you have the holy
or unholy trait, your mount gains it as well, as do the mount’s
Strikes. Typically, the steed is an animal companion with the
mount ability (such as a horse). The GM might allow another
animal companion option, or allow the creature to have a
different appearance that thematically fits your deity.

## Iron Repercussions Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites obedience cause
Disobeying your Iron Command has lasting consequences. If an
enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal persistent mental
damage instead of normal mental damage. You must decide
whether the mental damage will be persistent before your
enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of damage
is unchanged.

## Nimble Reprisal Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites justice cause
You can use Retributive Strike at greater distance. You can use
a ranged weapon to make a ranged Strike instead of a melee
Strike for Retributive Strike. The enemy needs to be in range,
but not in reach, and it must still be in your champion’s aura.
You can also make melee Strikes against enemies a bit farther
away. If the enemy that triggered your reaction is outside your
reach but is within 5 feet of your reach, as part of your reaction
you can Step to put the enemy in your reach before making a
melee Retributive Strike.

## Ongoing Selfishness Feat 1


## Uncommon Champion

Prerequisites desecration cause
Your powerful personality and incredible ego demand that you
protect yourself above all else. After you use Selfish Shield, you
gain resistance to all further damage from the triggering enemy
until the end of the turn on which you used the reaction. This
resistance is equal to half your Selfish Shield resistance.

## Unimpeded Step Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites liberation cause
With a burst of divine liberation, your ally’s movement from your
Liberating Step is unaffected by difficult terrain, greater difficult
terrain, narrow surfaces, and uneven ground. If you have the
exalted reaction benefit, this applies to everyone who Steps.

## Vicious Vengeance Feat 1


## Uncommon Champion

Prerequisites iniquity cause
While your vengeance is painful for both you and your foe,
none can doubt that your enemies suffer more. You gain a
circumstance bonus to the damage you deal from Destructive
Vengeance equal to the number of damage dice from the
reaction. This applies to only the damage the enemy takes, not
the damage to yourself or the extra damage you gain after using
the reaction.
### Weight Of Guilt  FEAT 1

## Champion

Prerequisites redemption cause
Guilt clouds the minds of those who ignore your Glimpse of
Redemption. Instead of making an enemy who refuses redemption
enfeebled 2, you can make it stupefied 2 for the same duration.

## 2Nd Level

### Divine Grace [reaction] FEAT 2

## Champion

Trigger You attempt a save against a spell, but you haven’t
rolled yet.
You call upon your deity’s grace, gaining a +2 circumstance
bonus to the save.

## Divine Health Feat 2


## Champion

Your faith makes you resistant to disease, protecting you as
you offer succor to the ill. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves
against diseases and poisons and to flat checks to recover from
persistent poison damage. Allies in your champion’s aura get
this benefit, but their bonus is +1.
In addition, if you roll a success on a save against a disease or
poison, you get a critical success instead. (Your allies don’t share
this benefit.) If you have the sacred body class feature, when
you roll a critical failure on a save against a disease or poison,
you get a failure instead.

## 4Th Level

### Aura Of Courage  FEAT 4

## Champion

Prerequisites champion’s aura, holy
You stand strong in the face of danger and inspire your allies
to do the same. Whenever you become frightened, reduce the
condition value by 1 (to a minimum of 0). At the end of your
turn, each ally in your champion’s aura reduces its frightened
value by 1.
### Aura Of Despair  FEAT 4

## Uncommon Champion

Prerequisites champion’s aura, unholy
Your presence as an avatar of evil makes your foes more
susceptible to terror and makes it almost impossible for
them to shake off fear when you are near. Enemies in your
champion’s aura take a –1 circumstance penalty to saving
throws against fear. In addition, an enemy that ends its turn in

your champion’s aura can’t reduce the value of its frightened
condition below 1.

## Cruelty Feat 4


## Champion

Prerequisites touch of the void
The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the strength
from your enemy’s body. You can cast touch of the void targeting
a living creature using 2 actions instead of 1. If you do, the target
is also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute if it fails its save (enfeebled 2 if
it critically fails).

## Mercy Feat 4


## Champion

Prerequisites lay on hands
Your touch soothes the body or mind. You can cast lay on
hands targeting a living creature using 2 actions instead of 1.
If you do, you can attempt to counteract one condition of your
choice affecting the target. When you select this feat, choose
one of the following options, which determines the conditions
you can choose: Mercy of the Body blinded, dazzled, deafened,
enfeebled, sickened; Mercy of Grace clumsy, grabbed, paralyzed;
Mercy of the Mind fleeing, frightened, stupefied.
Special You can select this feat up to three times. Each time,
choose a different type of mercy and add its options to those
you can choose when you cast a 2-action lay on hands.

## Security Feat 4


## Champion

Prerequisites shields of the spirit
Those you shield can benefit from your lasting protection. You
can cast shields of the spirit using 2 actions instead of 1. If you
do, you can choose one ally in your champion’s aura to gain a
spirit shield that accompanies it. For 1 minute, that ally gains the
benefits of shields of the spirit, even while the ally isn’t in your
champion’s aura and even if your shield isn’t raised. If you create
another companion shield, any previous one ends.

## 6Th Level

### Expand Aura [one-action] FEAT 6

## Champion Concentrate

Prerequisites champion’s aura
You focus your divine power to extend your influence and
protection. Expand the radius of your champion’s aura to 30 feet
until the start of your next turn. At 10th level, the expansion
lasts for 1 minute, and at 16th level, it lasts until you Dismiss it.

## Loyal Warhorse Feat 6


## Champion

Prerequisites Faithful Steed
The loyalty you and your mount share is unbreakable. The
mount you gained with Faithful Steed is now a mature animal

95

companion (Player Core 211). In addition, your mount never
attacks you, even if it is magically compelled to do so.
### Reactive Strike [reaction] FEAT 6

## Champion

Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate
action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves
a square during a move action it’s using.
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee
Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is
a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you
disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your
multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty
doesn’t apply to this Strike.

## Shield Warden Feat 6


## Champion

Prerequisites Shield Block
When you have a shield raised, you can use your Shield Block
reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to
you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage
instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the
normal rules for Shield Block.
### Smite [one-action] FEAT 6

## Champion Concentrate

You single out one enemy to destroy in your deity’s name.
Designate one enemy you can see. Until the start of your next
turn, your Strikes against that enemy gain a +3 status bonus
to damage, increasing to +4 if you have master proficiency
with the weapon or unarmed attack you’re using for the
Strike. If you’re holy or unholy and the target has the
opposite trait, the bonus is +4 (or +6 if you’re a master).
If the target takes a hostile action against you or one of
your allies before the start of your next turn, the duration
extends to the end of that enemy’s next turn. If the enemy
continues to take these hostile actions each turn, the duration
continues to extend.
Your current Smite ends if you use the Smite action again.

## 8Th Level

ADVANCED DEITY’S DOMAIN FEAT 8

controlled, slowed; if you’re 16th level, add doomed and stunned.

## Greater Security Feat 8


## Champion

Prerequisites Security
Shield in hand, you offer your ally its full protection you do
yourself. While the companion shield is in effect, if your shield is
raised, the ally with the companion shield gets the same bonus
to AC your shield grants, and you can trigger Shield Block if that
ally would meet the trigger. This uses your shield’s statistics and
applies damage to your shield.

## Heal Mount Feat 8


## Champion

Prerequisites Faithful Steed, lay on hands
Your devotion to your mount manifests as a surge of vital
energy. When you cast lay on hands on your mount, instead of
the normal amount, the spell restores 10 Hit Points, plus 10 for
each heightened rank.

You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At
the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction
that you can use only to Shield Block.

second blessing of the devoted (different from your first one)
and gain its benefits.

## Imposing Destrier Feat 10


## Champion

Prerequisites Loyal Warhorse
Under your care, your mount has realized its innate potential.
The mount you gained with Faithful Steed is now a nimble or
savage animal companion (Player Core 211).
Your animal companion has greater independence. During
an encounter, even if you don’t use the Command an Animal
action, your animal companion can still use 1 action that round
on your turn to Stride or Strike. It can do this at any point
during your turn, as long as you aren’t currently taking an
action. If it does, that’s all the actions it gets that round—you
can’t Command it later.

## Radiant Armament Feat 10


## Champion

Prerequisites blessed armament
Your blessed armament radiates power, further enhancing your
chosen weapon. When you choose the weapon for your blessed
armament during your daily preparations, add the astral and
brilliant property runes to the list of effects you can choose
from. If you’re holy, also add the holy rune, and if you’re unholy,
also add the unholy rune.
In addition, you can change the rune you’ve selected for the
day to a different rune from your list as a 10-minute activity
that has the concentrate, divine, and exploration traits.

only a limited number of times, such as Holy Healing for the
holy rune.
### Shield Of Reckoning [reaction] FEAT 10

## Champion

Prerequisites blessed shield, champion’s reaction, Shield Warden
Frequency once per round
Trigger An enemy’s attack against an ally matches the trigger for
both your Shield Block reaction and your champion’s reaction.
When you shield your ally against an attack, you call upon
your power to protect your ally further. You use the Shield
Block reaction to prevent damage to an ally and also use your
champion’s reaction against the enemy that attacked your ally.

reaction you can use to Shield Block or use your champion’s
reaction, you can use it for Shield of Reckoning.

## Spectral Advance Feat 10

lets you move to an enemy, bypassing hindrances.

## 12Th Level


## Affliction Mercy Feat 12


## Champion

Prerequisites Mercy

affliction. Add mercy of recuperation to the types of mercy you
can provide, allowing you to counteract an affliction instead of
an effect causing a condition (typically an affliction is a curse,
disease, or poison).
### Aura Of Faith  FEAT 12

## Champion

Prerequisites holy or unholy

97

You radiate an aura of belief that imbues your attacks and those
of nearby allies with divine power. Each willing ally in your

## Champion

Prerequisites blessed armament
Add the following property runes to the list you can choose for
your blessed armament: animated, greater fearsome, grievous,

feat, add greater astral and greater brilliant to the list as well.

of times.

## Sacred Defender Feat 20


## Champion

You are a great warrior that can stand strong against the
fiercest opponents to your cause. You gain resistance 5 to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you’re holy,
this resistance increases to 10 against unholy creatures, and

addition, creatures and effects that roll a natural 20 on an
attack roll against you don’t improve their result by one degree
of success.

## Shield Paragon Feat 20


## Champion

Prerequisites blessed shield
Your shield is a vessel of divine protection. When you’re
wielding your chosen shield, it is always raised, even without
you using the Raise a Shield action.
If the shield would be destroyed, it vanishes to your deity’s

repaired. While the shield is gone, you can spend 1 minute to
infuse a different shield with your blessed shield benefit until
your true shield returns.

## Swift Paragon Feat 20


## Champion

Prerequisites blessed swiftness
The movement of you and your allies is swift and decisive as
the judgment of your deity. If your ally starts a move action
in your champion’s aura, their movement during that action
doesn’t trigger reactions. In addition, you’re permanently
quickened. You can use your extra action only to Step or
Stride. If you have a fly Speed, add Fly to this list. If you have
an animal companion and are mounted on it at the start of
your turn, you can have your mount be quickened that turn
instead of you.

99

devious villains, discover ancient secrets, or unravel other mysteries. Your

During combat encounters...
Your keen insights regarding your foes make you more dangerous than
your physical strength would suggest. After spending a moment to study
your enemies, your perceptiveness allows you to act quickly, striking them
where it hurts most. You often assist tougher members of your party, wisely
protecting yourself while providing vital aid.
During social encounters...
Few can stand up against your scrutiny. You might not be the most charming,
but you see things for what they really are and develop an understanding of
a social situation rapidly. Every conversation is an investigation, after all,
and you never know what you might uncover!
While exploring...
You look for clues in your environment. You often prove yourself to be a valuable
ally by serving as a party scout, analyzing the intricacies of puzzles or mysterious
phenomena, and pursuing leads that could reveal beneficial information.
In downtime...
You study up on subjects new and old, make new allies you can share
information with, and pursue hobbies that keep your active mind satisfied.
You might make a bit of coin on the side working as a private detective or
consulting with the local constabulary.
You might...
- Start asking questions—including several that are quite involved—
immediately after you’re presented with a conundrum.
- Strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and
to identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes.
- Get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them
trivial.
Others probably...
- Find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if
difficult to fully comprehend.
- Get a bit annoyed that you’re such a know-it-all.
- Rely on you to solve mysteries, puzzles, or other challenges requiring
intellectual curiosity and reasoning.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an investigator. Abilities
gained at higher levels list the level at which you gain
them next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this
class.
On the Case
As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases
waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one
reaction you can use to investigate cases: Pursue a Lead
and Clue In.

## Pursue A Lead


## Concentrate Exploration Investigator

You name one detail you’ve identified that you think is part
of a larger mystery, then spend 1 minute examining it. The
detail is typically either obvious or something you’ve already
discovered using Recall Knowledge, Sense Motive, Gather
Information, or a similar action. After the minute passes, the
GM either confirms there’s a larger mystery or tells you there’s
nothing more to learn (the detail is inconsequential or you
know all the information already). If there is in fact a larger
mystery at play, you can’t Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes,
but you can choose to open an investigation. To do so, define
the question at the heart of the mystery, such as “Where has
the priceless work of art that was supposed to hang here been
taken?” or “Who or what killed this priest?” Work with your
GM to refine the question if need be. You can also give your
investigation a name to better keep track of it (such as “The
Case of the Cheated Goblin” or “The Skinsaw Murders”).
Investigation Bonus Whenever you attempt a Perception
check or skill check to attempt to get closer to answering
the question at the heart of an active investigation, you gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks
this applies to depend on the actions you use to investigate
and are determined by the GM, but checks to investigate
are typically Perception checks or skill checks that use
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
Active Investigations You can maintain two active
investigations at a time. If you Pursue another Lead after
that, the case must be different from any of your current
investigations (as far as you are aware), and you give up on
a current investigation of your choice. Once you’ve given up
pursuit of an investigation, you can’t Pursue a Lead into it again
until after the next time you make your daily preparations.
Solving an Investigation If you answer the question at
the heart of your investigation, the GM tells you that you’ve
done so. You don’t lose the bonus or other benefits until you
choose to close the investigation by Pursuing a Lead again
or voluntarily Dismissing it. If what you discover points
to an even larger mystery, you can work with the GM to
adapt the question and name of the investigation to the
new information.

### Clue In [reaction]

## Concentrate Investigator

Frequency once per 10 minutes
Trigger Another creature attempts a check that could help
get you closer to answering the question at the heart of
one of your active investigations.
You share information with the triggering creature. They
gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your
investigation bonus from Pursue a Lead. The GM can
add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the
situation, such as auditory and linguistic if you’re conveying
information verbally.
Devise a Stratagem
You can play out a battle in your head, using brains
rather than brawn to execute an attack.
DEVISE A STRATAGEM [one-action] OR [free-action]

## Concentrate Fortune Investigator

Frequency once per round
You assess a foe’s weaknesses in combat and use them to
formulate a plan of attack. Choose a creature you can see.
You can Devise a Stratagem as a free action if you’re aware
that creature could help answer the question at the heart of
one of your active investigations. Roll a d20, then decide on
an attack stratagem or skill stratagem.
Attack Stratagem If you Strike the chosen creature before the
start of your next turn, you must use the result of the d20
roll for your Strike’s attack roll instead of rolling. You make
this substitution only for the first Strike you make against
the creature this round, not any subsequent ones. When
you make this substitution, you can add your Intelligence
modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or
Dexterity modifier, provided you Strike with an agile or
finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack,
a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it’s a
melee weapon with the thrown trait), or a sap.
Skill Stratagem You can’t attempt to Strike the target until the
start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to your next Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based
skill check or Perception check involving the target before
the start of your next turn. If you would gain your Pursue
a Lead investigation bonus to such a check, that bonus
increases by 1 instead of you gaining the +1 bonus listed.
Methodology
Your studies have made you savvy in a broad spectrum
of areas, but one particular investigative process drew
your intense—even obsessive—interest. Choose a
methodology. The methodologies presented in this book
are as follows.
Alchemical Sciences
Your methodology emphasizes chemical and alchemical
analysis, collecting information from unusual particles
and fluids found on the scene. You possess enough
alchemical know-how to whip up a few tinctures to help
you with your cases.
You’re trained in Crafting and gain the Alchemical
Crafting skill feat (Player Core 252). You start with a
standard formula book (Player Core 288), which contains
the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items
of your choice (these must be elixirs or tools), in addition
to the formulas gained from Alchemical Crafting. Each
time you gain a level, you learn the formula for one
common alchemical elixir or alchemical tool of any level
of item you can create. Alchemical elixirs and tools begin
on pages 286 and 295, respectively.
During your daily preparations, you can create a
number of versatile vials equal to your Intelligence
modifier. Statistics for versatile vials appear on page 58
of the alchemist class.
You gain the Quick Tincture action, which you can
use to turn one of these vials into an elixir or alchemical
tool for which you know the formula. If you have the
ability to create versatile vials from more than one
source (such as the alchemist multiclass archetype), you
can use any of your versatile vials for any ability you
have that requires them.
### Quick Tincture [one-action]

## Investigator Manipulate

Cost 1 versatile vial
Requirements You know the formula for the alchemical item
you’re creating, you are holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit, and you have a free hand.
You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single
alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower that’s in your
formula book without having to spend the normal monetary
cost in alchemical raw materials or needing to attempt a
Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains
potent only until the end of the current turn.

## What Can I Investigate?

The detail you can investigate is typically a single
item, creature, or small location (such as a room or
corridor), though the GM might allow a different scope
for your investigation. Physical clues are usually the
best starting point, but the GM might allow you to start
an investigation from a rumor you learned or a similar
clue. For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough
to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty
sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your
investigation of that subject. The question at the heart
of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not
answerable through quick observation or a single die
roll. “Is this footprint made of mud?” is simple for an
investigator to answer, but “Who left these footprints?”
or “What location did this mud come from?” both have
enough potential for an investigation.

103

Empiricism
Everything comes down to data. Calculating statistics,
running numbers, and using inductive reasoning allows
you to determine the most likely outcome of any
scenario, and anything out of place draws your keen
attention.
You are trained in one Intelligence-based skill of
your choice. You gain the That’s Odd investigator feat
(page 107), and you gain the Expeditious Inspection
free action.
### Expeditious Inspection [free-action]

## Investigator

Frequency once per 10 minutes
You observe and assess your surroundings with great speed.
You Recall Knowledge, Seek, or Sense Motive.
Forensic Medicine
You’ve learned that in most cases, especially murders,
criminals tend to leave more evidence of the crime on
the body than they’d like to believe. Information from
bruising, bone fractures, blood spatters, and even the life
cycle of carrion insects can provide valuable clues that
help reconstruct the scene.
You’re trained in Medicine and gain the Forensic
Acumen (page 230) and Battle Medicine (Player Core
253) skill feats. When you use Battle Medicine, on a
success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to
your level, and the target becomes temporarily immune
for only 1 hour, not 1 day.
Interrogation
People can’t help but trust you, whether through your
inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking
to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others
talking, and you’ve developed interrogative techniques
to help you get to the truth of your investigations.
You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the No
Cause for Alarm skill feat (Player Core 259). You
can also Pursue a Lead at the same time you Make an
Impression, as long as you ask a question related to the
creature with which you’re conversing or a topic of your
conversation. You also gain the Pointed Question action.
### Pointed Question [one-action]
### Auditory Concentrate Investigator Linguistic Mental
You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the
right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can
see. Attempt a Diplomacy check against the creature’s Will
DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target must directly answer your
question. It doesn’t have to answer truthfully, but you
gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if
the creature attempts to Lie to you. Whether it answers
truthfully or not, you glean something from its body
language, and it is off-guard to the Strike you make using
Devise a Stratagem against it before the end of your turn.
Success As critical success, but the circumstance bonus to
your Perception DC is +2.
Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
Critical Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal,
and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to
your aggravating attention.
Investigator Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an
investigator class feat. These begin on page 106.
Strategic Strike
When you strike carefully and with forethought, you
deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your
Intelligence modifier to your attack roll due to Devising a
Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.

As your investigator level increases, so too does the
deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number
of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Skill Increases 2nd
You gain more skill increases than members of other
classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you
gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either
become trained in one skill you’re untrained in or to
become an expert in one skill in which you’re already
trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Keen Recollection 3rd
You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren’t
your specialty. Your proficiency bonus to untrained
skill checks to Recall Knowledge is equal to your level
instead of +0.
Skillful Lessons 3rd
At 3rd level and every odd-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a skill feat. This feat must be for an Intelligence-,
Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, or for the skill you
gained from your methodology.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you
gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
thereafter.
Weapon Expertise 5th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies
of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks
increase to expert.
Vigilant Senses 7th
Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen
awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank
in Perception increases to master.
Weapon Specialization 7th
You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you
know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This
damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if
you’re legendary.
Fortitude Expertise 9th
Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures.
Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to
expert.
Investigator Expertise 9th
You’ve refined your investigative techniques to an
exceptional degree. Your circumstance bonus from
Pursue a Lead increases to +2. Your proficiency rank for
your investigator class DC increases to expert.
Deductive Improvisation 11th
You use your skills at deduction to perform whatever
task is necessary to solve the case. You can attempt any
check that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if
you’re untrained in it; you can attempt any check that
requires you to have expert proficiency in a skill so long
as you’re trained in it; and you can attempt any check
that requires you to have master proficiency in a skill as
long as you have expert proficiency in it.
Dogged Will 11th
In your pursuit of truth and knowledge, you won’t be
dissuaded. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases
to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you
get a critical success instead.
Incredible Senses 13th
You notice things that are almost impossible for an
ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for
Perception increases to legendary.
Light Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and
unarmored defense increase to expert.

Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
Savvy Reflexes 15th

on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

105

Greater Dogged Will 17th
Your willpower becomes truly unbreakable. Your
proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary.
When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical
success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save,
you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save
against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
Light Armor Mastery 19th
Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your
ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light
armor and unarmored defense increase to master.
Master Detective 19th
As a master detective, you can solve any case and find all
the clues available. Your reputation precedes you, and
even the most skilled criminals and deceivers fear you.
Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC
increases to master.
In addition, if you enter a new location that includes
another clue toward answering the question at the heart
of one of your active investigations, the GM informs
you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object,
person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue,
the GM informs you that you’ve done so.
If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM
chooses one to inform you about. When you find any
of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that
you’ve done so, even if it wasn’t the clue they’d chosen
or there are other clues you haven’t found.
Investigator Feats
At every level that you gain an investigator feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level

### Eliminate Red Herrings  FEAT 1

## Investigator

You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry.
When you roll a critical failure on a skill check to Recall
Knowledge related to a question about one of your active
investigations, you get a failure instead.

## Flexible Studies Feat 1


## Investigator

You’ve collected a cross-section of information on various
disciplines you can refer to when preparing for various tasks.
During your daily preparations, you can cram on a certain
subject to become temporarily trained in one skill of your
choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. As this
proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for
a permanent character option like a skill increase or a feat.

## Known Weaknesses Feat 1


## Investigator

Whenever you Devise a Stratagem, you can also attempt a
check to Recall Knowledge as part of that action before rolling
the d20. If you critically succeed at the Recall Knowledge
check, you notice a weakness and can convey the information

to allies to grant each of them a +1 circumstance bonus to their
next attack roll against the subject, as long as their attack is
made before the beginning of your next turn. If you choose
an attack stratagem, this bonus applies to that attack roll too.

## Takedown Expert Feat 1


## Investigator

You’ve mastered combat practices that let you get up close and
bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence
modifier on attack rolls for an attack stratagem if you’re using
a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club or staff),
in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for
your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any of your
Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal –2 penalty.

## That’S Odd Feat 1


## Investigator

When you enter a new location, such as a room or corridor,
you immediately notice one thing out of the ordinary. The GM
determines what it is, or whether there’s nothing reasonable
to pick up, skipping obvious clues that can be easily noticed
without a check or specifically looking for them. You learn only
that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it’s suspicious.
For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain
on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it’s
evident to you already, so the GM might note that there’s
something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You
would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out
what specifically is out of the ordinary. If you wish, you can
Pursue a Lead concerning this detail even if you have Pursed a
Lead less than 10 minutes ago.
That’s Odd doesn’t reveal whether creatures are suspicious.
You don’t typically get any benefit when you leave and come
back to a place, though if a major change has happened there
and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do.

## Trap Finder Feat 1


## Investigator

You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers
and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by
traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren’t Searching,
you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be
Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to
find the trap.
You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery,
you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against
traps increase to +2.

## Underworld Investigator Feat 1


## Investigator

Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the
criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you
might have gained an understanding of how they operate from
the outside. You become trained in Underworld Lore, and you
gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus to Thievery checks
to investigate a case (such as checks to Steal a clue from a
suspect or Pick a Lock to open a safe with damning documents).

## 2Nd Level


## Athletic Strategist Feat 2


## Investigator

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body
weight. In addition to using an attack stratagem’s roll
substitution for a Strike, you can use it to modify a Disarm,
Grapple, Reposition, Shove, or Trip attempt, substituting your
Devise a Stratagem roll for the Athletics check. You must apply
the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether
it’s a Strike or one of the Athletics actions.
You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of
Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your
Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you’re using a weapon for the
maneuver and the weapon doesn’t fit the restrictions for using
Intelligence with a stratagem.

## Certain Stratagem Feat 2


## Investigator

You know exactly where to strike a foe to target their weak
spots. When you make a Strike that you’re adding your
Intelligence modifier to due to Devising a Stratagem and miss,
you deal half of your strategic strike damage to the target.
This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you
used for the Strike.
### Exploit Blunder [reaction] FEAT 2

## Investigator

Trigger A creature you Devised a Stratagem against on your
most recent turn fails or critically fails a Strike against you.
By watching your foes closely, you can make the most out of
their mistakes. You Step.
### Person Of Interest [one-action] FEAT 2

## Investigator

Frequency once per 10 minutes
Sometimes, you need to follow the leads as they come in
the middle of an investigation. Choose a creature that you
can see who isn’t, to your knowledge, tied to any of your
current investigations. For the next minute, you can Devise a
Stratagem against that creature as a free action.

## Shared Stratagem Feat 2


## Investigator

The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself.
When you hit a creature with an attack on which you
substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
designate one ally. The creature you hit is off-guard to that ally
on the next attack that ally makes against that creature before
the start of your next turn.

107


## Solid Lead Feat 2


## Investigator

Sometimes your case splinters into smaller mysteries, but
you never lose sight of the big picture. Once per day when
you give up on the subject of a lead due to using Pursue a
Lead again, you can designate the lead you stopped pursuing
as your solid lead for the day. Even though you stopped
following the solid lead, you can change back to your solid
lead any number of times by using a single action, which
has the concentrate trait. Doing so ends one of your current
leads as normal.
During your next daily preparations, you can maintain
your solid lead or you can remove it; removing it allows you
to designate a new solid lead later that day.

## 4Th Level


## Alchemical Discoveries Feat 4


## Investigator

Prerequisites alchemical sciences methodology
You’ve devoted extra time in the lab to improve your
knowledge of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two
alchemical items each time you level up instead of one; these
must still be elixirs or tools. The number of versatile vials you
can create each day increases by one if you’re an expert in
Crafting, two if you’re a master, or three if you’re legendary.

## Detective’S Readiness Feat 4


## Investigator

When you’re on a case, you stay watchful and resolute to avoid
tricks your suspect might pull. You gain your investigation
bonus from Pursue a Lead on saving throws (and their DCs,
as normal) against creatures or effects that are related to
the question at the heart of an open investigation, and you
can use Clue In to assist an ally’s saving throw against that
creature or effect.

## Lie Detector Feat 4


## Investigator

Prerequisites empiricism or interrogation methodology
You’re adept at noticing the tells of a liar—sweat, flushing,
a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive and
to Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you. When you
determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to
your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next
Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check you
attempt against that creature within the next minute.
If you would gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus
to any of the above checks, that bonus increases by 1 instead
of you gaining the +1 bonus listed.

## Ongoing Investigation Feat 4


## Investigator

You’re always investigating what’s around you, even as you
perform other activities. You can move at full Speed while

## Coroner

When someone finds a body, you’re first on the scene. You
share the clues you learn through keen observation with
your team to ensure you always apprehend the culprit.

using the Investigate exploration activity, and you can use
another exploration activity while Investigating.

## Scalpel’S Point Feat 4


## Investigator

Prerequisites forensic medicine methodology
Your stratagems benefit from your precise knowledge of
anatomy. When you critically hit with an attack on which
you substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
if your attack dealt piercing or slashing damage, you also
deal 1d6 persistent bleed damage to your target.

## Strategic Assessment Feat 4


## Investigator

You learn your foes’ strengths and weaknesses by watching
them move. When you hit a creature with a Strike on which
you substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
the GM chooses one of the following pieces of information
about the enemy to tell you.
- Which of the enemy’s weaknesses is highest
- Which of the enemy’s resistances is highest
- Which of the enemy’s saving throws is lowest
- One immunity the enemy has
The GM can choose deliberately or at random, but they
can’t choose information that doesn’t apply (such as choosing
an immunity for an enemy that has no immunities). This
applies only the first time you hit a given creature.

## 6Th Level

### Connect The Dots [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Auditory Concentrate Investigator Linguistic

Ephemeral connections between people, places, and concepts
are invisible to most, but seeing them is your stock and trade.
Choose an ally and a non-allied creature. You must be able
to see both of them. You briefly study the way they both
move and attempt a Perception check against the higher
of the non-allied creature’s Deception DC or Will DC. Both
targets are then temporarily immune to Connect the Dots for
10 minutes.
Critical Success You spot a way for your ally to take advantage
of the other target’s flaws and let them know about it. Your
ally gains your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus as a
circumstance bonus to all its Strikes or skill checks against
the creature until the start of your next turn.
Success As critical success, but your ally gains the bonus
only for their next Strike or skill check against the creature.
Failure You fail to make a connection.
Critical Failure You misconstrue a vital piece of information,
which temporarily disconcerts you. You are stupefied 1
until the end of your next turn.

## Predictive Purchase Feat 6


## Investigator

You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the Prescient
Planner and Prescient Consumable feats (Player Core 260).
When using Prescient Planner, you can pull out the item
as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or a similar
container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.

## Thorough Research Feat 6


## Investigator

You have comprehensive knowledge in your fields of interest.
When you succeed at a Recall Knowledge check, you gain
additional information or context. When you critically
succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, you get additional
information or context or can ask an additional follow-up
question (the GM chooses which).

## 8Th Level


## Blind-Fight Feat 8


## Investigator

Prerequisites master in Perception
Your battle insights make you more aware of concealed
and invisible opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat
check to target concealed creatures. You’re not off-guard
to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you’re offguard
to them for reasons other than the hidden condition),
and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a
hidden creature.
While you’re adjacent to an undetected creature of your
level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
### Clue Them All In  FEAT 8

## Investigator

You can clue in all your allies at once. When you use the Clue
In reaction, any of your allies who are attempting the same
check to investigate one of your active investigations receive
the circumstance bonus from Clue In. If you use this ability
during an encounter, they must attempt their check within 1
round of when you Clued them In.

## Defensive Stratagem Feat 8


## Investigator

By scrutinizing a foe, you learn how to better avoid its
attacks. When you use Devise a Stratagem, you can choose
a defensive stratagem instead of an attack or skill stratagem
after you roll a d20.
Defensive Stratagem You can’t attempt to Strike the target
until the start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to all your defenses against effects caused by the
target until the start of your next turn.

## Whodunnit? Feat 8


## Uncommon Investigator

Frequency once per day
You carefully consider your case and narrow down some
of the details. When you Pursue a Lead and learn there’s a
larger mystery, you can ask two questions related to your
investigation when you open it. The GM must answer truthfully
with “yes” or “no,” though if the answer would be misleading

109

or have no practical application to your investigation, the GM
can answer “immaterial.” You can’t use Whodunnit? more than
once for the same lead, even across different days.
Your questions must come from the following list, applying
to the detail that spurred your investigation.
- Was this clue left by a [creature trait]? (Choose a creature
trait such as humanoid, undead, or dwarf; this trait must
be accurate as of the time the clue was left.)
- Was this clue left within the last hour?
- Was this clue left within the last day?
- Was the creature that left this clue in a heightened
emotional state when it left the clue?
- Did anyone attempt to conceal this clue?

## 10Th Level

### Just One More Thing [one-action] FEAT 10

## Fortune Investigator

Requirements Your most recent action was to Demoralize,
Feint, or Request, and you failed but didn’t critically fail.
After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you
add another bit of information or ask a pointed question,
possibly salvaging your previous attempt. Reroll the failed
check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check
is involved with one of your active investigations, double your
investigation bonus from Pursue a Lead on the rerolled check.
That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing
for 1 day.
You can also use this action if you failed, but didn’t critically
fail, at a check to Lie, Gather Information, Make an Impression,
or Coerce. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding
Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you
initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.

## Ongoing Strategy Feat 10


## Investigator

Prerequisites strategic strike
You’re constantly studying small aspects of everyone’s
movements, even if you don’t have a stratagem in place
ahead of time. On any Strike for which you didn’t Devise a
Stratagem, you still deal precision damage equal to your
number of strategic strike damage dice so long as the weapon
or unarmed attack you used is one that would have let you use
your Intelligence modifier had you Devised a Stratagem.
### Suspect Of Opportunity [reaction] FEAT 10

## Investigator

Prerequisites Person of Interest
Trigger A creature who isn’t, to your knowledge, tied to any
of your active investigations takes a hostile action against
you in combat.
Sometimes something intrudes upon your case unexpectedly,
such as an ambush sent to bring your investigation to a close.
You use Person of Interest against the triggering creature. This
doesn’t allow you to use Person of Interest more frequently
than normal.

## Analyst

Eyes ever open and mind ever turning, you single out
clues and pursue them until you find the truth.
Attributes
Prioritize Intelligence to prepare a panoply of facts and
figures. Wisdom lets you sense every clue and danger,
and Dexterity keeps you safe and active in combat.

(8th), Empiricist’s Eye (12th)
Sample Investigator


## 12Th Level


## Empiricist’S Eye Feat 12


## Investigator

Prerequisites empiricism methodology
Sharp and piercing, your eyes see all and convey more. Your
Point Out actions lose the auditory trait, and you don’t need to
be heard to convey the information to your allies. In addition, a
creature you Point Out is off-guard to your allies until the start
of your next turn.
Special If you have the Blind-Fight feat, your allies gain that
feat’s benefits against any creature that’s off-guard due to
Empiricist’s Eye.
### Foresee Danger [reaction] FEAT 12

## Concentrate Investigator

Trigger A creature targets you with an attack, and you can see
the attacker.
You perceive every possible way your foe’s attack could land
and attempt to avoid them all. The triggering attack roll targets
your Perception DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you
to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any
conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example,
an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to
you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn’t take the –2
circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
### Just As Planned [free-action] FEAT 12

## Fortune Investigator

Frequency once per hour
In the blink of an eye, you calculate your enemy’s movements
and know exactly where to aim your next blow. If your next
action is to Devise a Stratagem, you can roll the d20 twice
and take the higher result.
MAKE ’EM SWEAT FEAT 12

## Investigator

Prerequisites interrogation methodology
Your line of questioning lets a suspect know you can
see right through them, shaking them to the core. When
you succeed at using Pointed Question, the target is also
frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical success). This
added effect is an emotion and fear effect, but the other
effects of Pointed Question still apply even if the target is
immune to fear.
### Reason Rapidly [one-action] FEAT 12

## Investigator

Your mind works through clues at an unbelievable speed. You
instantly use up to five Recall Knowledge actions. If you have
any special abilities or free actions that would normally be
triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can’t use them
for these actions.

111

### Share Tincture [one-action] FEAT 12

## Investigator

Prerequisites alchemical sciences methodology
You use Quick Tincture, and the item you create remains
potent until the start of your next turn. Then you can
Interact to pass the item to another creature. If you pass it by
throwing it, your ranged attack automatically succeeds. You
must have a versatile vial to use Quick Tincture, as normal.
### Surgical Shock [one-action] FEAT 12

## Attack Investigator

Prerequisites forensic medicine methodology
With a few well-placed jabs with your fist or weapon, you
render your opponent disoriented or ungainly. Attempt a
Medicine check against the Fortitude DC of a target within
your reach. The result of your check determines the severity
of the condition you inflict.
Critical Success The target is either clumsy 3 or stupefied 3
until the end of your next turn. The target is then immune
to Surgical Shock for 1 hour.
Success As critical success, but the target is either clumsy 2
or stupefied 2.
Failure The target is minorly inconvenienced. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to the next attack action you attempt
against it before the end of your turn.
Critical Failure The target is unaffected and you overextend
yourself, triggering reactions as if you had used a
manipulate action.

## 14Th Level

### Plot The Future  FEAT 14

## Uncommon Concentrate Investigator Prediction

You spend 10 minutes in contemplation to uncannily predict
how events will play out. Choose a particular goal or activity
you plan to engage in within 1 week, or an event you expect
might happen within 1 week. You analyze whether it’s likely
to come to pass, learning whether it’s highly likely, somewhat
likely, somewhat unlikely, or highly unlikely. You also gain a
piece of advice suggesting a course of action you or your
allies could take that might make the chosen event more or
less likely, whichever you prefer. The GM determines the
likeliness of the event and the piece of advice you learn.
### Sense The Unseen [reaction] FEAT 14

## Investigator

Trigger You fail a check to Seek.
When you look for foes, you notice the slightest of cues. Even
though you failed at the triggering check, you automatically
sense any undetected creatures in the area where you’re
Seeking, making them merely hidden to you.

## Strategic Bypass Feat 14


## Investigator

Your plans account for your foes’ resistances, enabling
you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike on

## Chemist

With carefully formulated chemical compounds, you
find chemical clues at crime scenes and boost your
investigative acumen with mutagens and other elixirs.
Attributes

while Constitution keeps you healthy.

your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies
against your attack.

## 16Th Level


## Didactic Strike Feat 16


## Investigator

Prerequisites Shared Stratagem
When you find a glaring weakness, you can set your allies
up to annihilate your foe. When you use Shared Stratagem,
you can designate up to 10 allies instead of just one. The foe
is off-guard against the first attack from each designated ally
before your next turn, and each ally’s first attack deals an
extra 2d6 precision damage to the target if it hits.

## Implausible Purchase Feat 16


## Investigator

Prerequisites Predictive Purchase
It seems impossible, but you’ve analyzed every angle and are
able to just keep pulling out exactly the item you need, even
in far-flung locations. You can use Prescient Planner even if
you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can
use it as a single action instead of a 2-action activity, during
which you Interact to draw the item. In addition, five times
per day, you can use Prescient Planner to pull out a common
consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
### Reconstruct The Scene  FEAT 16

## Concentrate Investigator

You spend 1 minute surveying a small location (such as a
single room) to get an impression of events that occurred
there in the last day. This involves moving about the area and
studying footprints, the placement of objects, spilled drinks
or blood, and so forth.
You get an indistinct mental impression of significant
events that happened there. This gives you clues and details
of the past, including the overall events and their time frame,
but it’s not a perfect record. This also isn’t enough to identify
who was involved in these events if you weren’t already
aware the person was there.
As determined by the GM, you also pick out various
seemingly small details that could serve as important clues
you can use to Purse a Lead, like a memorable weapon
someone used for a murder or the type of cloak someone
wore when passing through.

## 18Th Level


## Lead Investigator Feat 18


## Exploration Investigator

Prerequisites Clue Them All In
You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one
of your open investigations. Those allies gain the same
circumstance bonus you do from Pursue a Lead to checks
to investigate the question at the heart of that investigation.
This bonus lasts until you cease Pursing that Lead or for 1
day, whichever comes first. This doesn’t confer any other
benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance
bonus to your saves with Detective’s Readiness.
TRICKSTER’S ACE [reaction] FEAT 18

## Concentrate Investigator

Trigger You specify the trigger when you make your daily
preparations (see Requirements below).
Requirements When you make your daily preparations, you
must specify a trigger for this reaction using the same
restrictions as the triggers for the Ready action. You also
choose a single spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or
primal list of 4th level or lower. The spell can’t have a cost,
nor can its casting time be more than 10 minutes. The spell
must be able to target a single creature, and you must be
a valid target for it.
Whether from jury-rigged magic items, deduction from the
study of magical interactions, or other means, you have a
contingency in your back pocket for desperate situations.
When the trigger occurs, you cause the spell to come into
effect. The spell targets only you, no matter how many
creatures it would affect normally. If you define particularly
complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger
might fail. Once the contingency is triggered, the spell is
expended until your next daily preparations.

## 20Th Level

EVERYONE’S A SUSPECT FEAT 20

## Investigator

You are so suspicious of everyone you meet that you keep
mental notes on how to defeat them all—even your own
allies. After interacting with a creature for at least 1 minute,
you automatically Pursue a Lead with that creature as the
subject. You can have any number of such leads at any given
time, and when you Pursue a Lead again, you don’t give up
any of these automatic subjects.
### Just The Facts  FEAT 20

## Investigator

Prerequisites Thorough Research
You fundamentally understand everything to the point where
your research can’t possibly be wrong. You are permanently
quickened and can use the extra action to Recall Knowledge. In
addition, you gain the following benefits with Recall Knowledge.
- Your checks to Recall Knowledge are no longer secret.
- When you Recall Knowledge, you use the outcome for one
degree of success better than the result of your check.
- If an effect (such as Dubious Knowledge) would give
you inaccurate information from your Recall Knowledge
check, you know which information is inaccurate.
- When one of your allies Recalls Knowledge and gains
false information, you also know that information is
inaccurate if they share it with you.

113

The strength of your fist flows from your mind and spirit. You seek perfection,
honing your body into a flawless instrument and your mind into an orderly bastion
of wisdom. You’re a fierce combatant renowned for martial arts skills and combat
stances that grant you unique fighting moves. While the challenge of mastering
many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating on philosophical
questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a monk. Abilities gained at higher
levels list the requisite levels next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Flurry of Blows
You can attack rapidly with the Flurry of Blows action.
### Flurry Of Blows [one-action]

## Flourish Monk

Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine
their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As a
flourish ability, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.
Monk Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a monk class feat. These begin on page 118.
Powerful Fist
Your fists are deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist
increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. You don’t take the normal
–2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with
your fist or any other unarmed attacks.

feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Incredible Movement 3rd
You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status
bonus to your Speed whenever you’re not wearing armor.
The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have
beyond 3rd.
Mystic Strikes 3rd
Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues
them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become
magical, allowing them to get past resistances to nonmagical
attacks. However, you still need an item such
as handwraps of mighty blows to gain an item bonus to
attack rolls or increase your attacks’ weapon damage dice.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in
one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency
rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at
15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill
in which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

Expert Strikes 5th

critical hit with an unarmed attack in the brawling group,
you get its critical specialization effect.
Perception Expertise 5th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Path to Perfection 7th
You have progressed along your own path to enlightenment.
Choose your Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throw. Your
proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases
to master. When you roll a success on the chosen saving
throw, you get a critical success instead.
Weapon Specialization 7th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
4 if you’re legendary.
Metal Strikes 9th
You can adjust your body to strike with the mystic energy of
rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron
and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety
of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.
Monk Expertise 9th
Your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to
expert. If you have qi spells, your proficiency rank for spell
attacks and spell DCs increases to expert.
Second Path to Perfection 11th
You’ve learned to find perfection in every success. Choose
a different saving throw than the one you chose for your
path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen
saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with
the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.
Graceful Mastery 13th
You move with perpetual grace, turning aside blows. Your
proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.
Master Strikes 13th
You’ve honed your body into an even deadlier weapon.
Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple
weapons increase to master.
Greater Weapon Specialization 15th
Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
Third Path to Perfection 15th
You have made great progress in your personal studies
of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws
you selected for path to perfection or second path to
perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen type of
save increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure
on the chosen type of save, you get a failure instead. When
you roll a failure on the chosen type of save against an
effect that deals damage, you take half damage.
Adamantine Strikes 17th
When you focus your will into your limbs, your blows
are as unyielding as the hardest of metals. Your unarmed
attacks are treated as adamantine.
Graceful Legend 17th
Your sublime movement grants you unparalleled protection
and offense. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense
increases to legendary, and your proficiency rank for your
monk class DC increases to master. If you have qi spells,
your proficiency rank for spell attack modifiers and spell
DCs increases to master.

117

Perfected Form 19th
You have purged incompetence from your techniques. On
your first Strike of your turn, if you roll lower than 10, you
can treat the attack roll as a 10. This is a fortune effect.
Monk Feats
Every level at which you gain a monk feat, select one of the
following feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites before
taking the feat.

## 1St Level

### Crane Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
Your arms flutter like a crane’s wings. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing
attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling
group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for High Jump
and Long Jump by 5, and when you Leap, you can move an
additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
### Dragon Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes
like a lashing dragon’s tail. You can make dragon tail attacks
that deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling
group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of
difficult terrain while Striding.
### Monastic Archer Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored and wielding a longbow, a
shortbow, or a bow with the monk trait.
You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered
around the use of a bow. While in this stance, the only Strikes
you can make are those using longbows, shortbows, or bows
with the monk trait. You can use Flurry of Blows with these
bows. You can use your other monk feats or monk abilities
that normally require unarmed attacks with these bows when
attacking within half the first range increment (normally 50
feet for a longbow and 30 feet for a shortbow), so long as the
feat or ability doesn’t require a single, specific Strike.
Special When you select this feat, you become trained in the
longbow, shortbow, and any simple and martial bows with
the monk trait. If you gain the expert strikes class feature,
your proficiency rank for these weapons increases to
expert, and if you gain the master strikes class feature, your
proficiency rank for these weapons increases to master.

## Monastic Weaponry Feat 1


## Monk

You have trained with the weaponry of your monastery
or school. You gain access to uncommon weapons with
the monk trait and become trained in simple and martial
monk weapons. When your proficiency for unarmed attacks
increases to expert or master, your proficiency rank for
these weapons increases to expert or master as well. If
you have familiarity with an agile or finesse weapon
(such as from the Catfolk Weapon Familiarity feat),
that weapon also gains the monk trait for you.
You can use melee monk weapons with any of your
monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed
attacks, though not if the feat or ability requires you to use a
single specific type of attack, such as Crane Stance.
If you gain the critical specialization benefit for unarmed
attacks—with the expert strikes class feature, for example—
you also gain it with monk weapons.
### Mountain Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored and touching the ground.

You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique
created by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with
the weight of an avalanche and block blows with your
garments. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone
unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are
in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and
unarmed traits.
While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to
AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against
Reposition, Shove, Trip, and other forced movement effects.
You have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning
you don’t add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are

## Qi Spells Feat 1


## Monk

You have cultivated your qi to produce magical effects. You
gain inner upheaval, qi rush, or another 1st-rank monk qi spell
you have access to. The rules for qi spells are summarized in
the sidebar on this page, and qi spells appear on page 257.
### Stumbling Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Prerequisite trained in Deception
You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the
movements of the inebriated—bobbing, weaving, leaving
false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true
movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to Deception checks to Feint. The only Strikes you can
make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8
bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the
agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If
an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance,
it becomes off-guard against the next stumbling swing Strike
you make against it before the end of your next turn.
### Tiger Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a tiger and can make tiger claw attacks.
These deal 1d8 slashing damage; are in the brawling group;
and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. On a
critical success with your tiger claws, if you deal damage, the
target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage.
As long as your Speed is at least 20 feet while in Tiger
Stance, you can Step 10 feet.
### Wolf Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands
held like fangs. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These
deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the
agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
If you’re flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw
unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait.

## 2Nd Level


## Crushing Grab Feat 2


## Monk

Like a powerful constrictor, you crush targets in your unyielding
grasp. When you successfully Grapple a creature, you can deal
bludgeoning damage to that creature equal to your Strength
modifier. You can make this attack nonlethal with no penalty.

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many monk abilities.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.
You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Incapacitation: An ability with this trait can take
a character out of the fight. But when you use an
incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level
than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack
roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of
success of its saving throws for that effect by one step.
Qi Spells: By tapping into an inner reserve of energy,
called qi, you can cast special spells called qi spells, which
are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a
focus spell. When you gain your first qi spell, you decide
whether your qi spells are divine or occult spells, and you
become trained in spell attack modifiers and spell DCs;
your key spellcasting attribute is Wisdom. You also gain
a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool
during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus
Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to
steady your mind and breath to draw in more qi from the
world around you.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. The maximum Focus Points your focus
pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you
have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules
for focus spells appear on page 298 of Player Core.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you
enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action
again, whichever comes first. After you take an action that
has the stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round.
You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
You can Dismiss a stance.
Venomous: These weapons inject poison into every hit.
When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an
additional 1 persistent poison damage. This increases to
2 persistent poison damage if the weapon has a greater
striking rune.

### Whirling Blade Stance [one-action] FEAT 14

## Monk Stance

Prerequisites Monastic Weaponry
You enter a mindful stance that creates a deep connection
between you and your monk weapons, allowing you to
manipulate them with your qi, even at a distance. All melee
monk weapons you wield with the finesse trait gain the
thrown 10 feet trait (unless they already have the thrown trait
with a greater range).
Once you’ve made a thrown Strike with such a weapon, you
can use the precision of your throw to make additional strikes
with it, even from a distance. Start from the space of the previous
Strike’s target to determine the range increment and whether the
new target has cover. At the end of your turn, the thrown weapon
flies directly back to you in a straight line. If a solid barrier blocks
its path, it falls to the ground after hitting the barrier.
### Wild Winds Gust [two-actions] FEAT 14

## Air Concentrate Manipulate Monk

Prerequisites Wild Winds Initiate
Requirements You are in Wild Winds Stance.
You build air pressure with repeated motions, before releasing
an enormous crescent of rushing wind strikes. Make a wind
crash Strike against each creature in your choice of a 30-foot
cone or a 60 foot line. These attacks all count toward your
multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until
after you make all the attacks.

## 16Th Level


## Fuse Stance Feat 16


## Monk

Prerequisites at least two stances
You have combined two stances into a single stance all your
own. When you take this feat, choose two stances you know
and combine them into a single fused stance. Give your new
fused stance a unique name. When you enter your fused
stance, you gain all the effects of both stances, including the
requirements and restrictions.
If the stances both grant special attacks, you gain all those
attacks. If a stance restricts you to one particular attack
(such as Crane Stance), you must abide by that restriction.
If the fused stances have incompatible restrictions, the GM
determines which apply, or determines you can’t fuse those
stances at all.
### Master Of Many Styles [free-action] FEAT 16

## Monk

Prerequisites Reflexive Stance
Trigger Your turn begins.
You can shift between stances without a thought, your
movements an unceasing dance of martial arts forms. You use
an action with the stance trait.
### Master Qi Spells  FEAT 16

## Monk

Prerequisites Qi Spells
You have achieved near-total mastery of your qi. You gain
medusa’s wrath, touch of death, or another 8th-rank qi spell
you have access to.

## One-Millimeter Punch Feat 16


## Monk

Prerequisites One-Inch Punch
Your punches have incredible force and control. When you
damage a target using One-Inch Punch, you can focus your
qi to send the foe flying. If you do, the target must attempt a
Fortitude save against your class DC.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is pushed back 5 feet.
Failure The target is pushed back 10 feet.
Critical Failure The target is pushed back 10 feet for each
action you spent on One-Inch Punch.

### Shattering Strike [two-actions] FEAT 16

## Monk

The force of your considered blow shatters objects and
defenses alike. Make an unarmed Strike. It bypasses the
target’s resistances. If the target has Hardness, the Strike
treats the Hardness as if it were half its value.

## 18Th Level


## Diamond Fists Feat 18


## Monk

Your body hardens as you combine your attacks, making your
finishing blows more damaging. Your unarmed attacks gain
the forceful and deadly d10 traits. Any that already had one
or both of these traits increase their weapon damage dice by
one step.
### Grandmaster Qi Spells  FEAT 18

## Monk

Prerequisites Qi Spells
You have unlocked a qi technique achievable only by those
who attain complete mastery of both their body and their
spirit. You gain embrace nothingness, qi form, or another 9thrank
qi spell you have access to.
### Qi Center [free-action] FEAT 18

## Monk

Prerequisites Qi Spells, Master of Many Styles
Frequency once per minute
You center yourself with the universe and draw upon its vast
power. You cast a single action qi spell with the stance trait,
without spending a Focus Point.
### Swift River [free-action] FEAT 18

## Monk

Trigger Your turn ends and you have a status penalty to your
Speed or are immobilized or slowed.
You flow like water, avoiding all restraints. End one status
penalty to your speed, or end one immobilized or slowed
condition affecting you.
### Triangle Shot [two-actions] FEAT 18

## Concentrate Fortune Monk

Prerequisites Monastic Archer Stance, Stunning Blows
Requirements You are in Monastic Archer Stance and wielding
a bow usable with that stance.
You string three arrows to your bow and fire them all at once.
Make three ranged Strikes against a single target with the
required weapon, each using your current multiple attack
penalty, and you take an additional –2 penalty. This counts
as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty,
and you combine the attacks’ damage for the purpose of
resistances and weaknesses. Your Stunning Blows benefit
applies to Triangle Shot, even though it isn’t a Flurry of
Blows. If all three Strikes hit, the target takes 3d6 persistent
bleed damage.

## 20Th Level


## Enduring Quickness Feat 20


## Monk

You move as fast and freely as the wind. You’re permanently
quickened. You can use your extra action to Stride or Leap, or to
provide one of the actions needed for a High Jump or Long Jump.
### Godbreaker [three-actions] FEAT 20

## Monk

Prerequisites Crushing Grab, Whirling Throw
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
You have mastered an ultimate grappling technique capable
of breaking even the mightiest of foes. You hurl the creature
20 feet into the air, following behind it with a powerful jump,
and then make an unarmed Strike. If the Strike is successful,
you can repeat this process up to two more times, moving the
creature an additional 20 feet directly up into the air with
each Strike; the creature keeps the grabbed or restrained
condition throughout the sequence. If you miss with any of the
Strikes, Godbreaker and the grabbed or restrained condition
immediately end and both you and the opponent fall, taking
falling damage as normal for the total height of your jump.
If all three Strikes are successful, you immediately grab
the creature and bring it crashing to the ground, dealing your
unarmed Strike damage plus falling damage to it. You land on
your feet adjacent to the creature, you take no damage from
the fall, and the creature remains grabbed or restrained by you.

## Immortal Techniques Feat 20


## Monk

Prerequisites Master of Many Styles
You flow from technique to technique, renewing yourself as
you embrace each style you have mastered. The first time
each round that you use an action that has both the monk and
stance traits, you gain 20 temporary Hit Points that last until
the start of your next turn.
### Impossible Technique [reaction] FEAT 20

## Fortune Monk

Trigger An enemy’s attack hits you or you fail a saving throw
against an enemy’s ability.
Requirements You are not armored or fatigued.
You execute a maneuver that defies possibility. If the triggering
effect was an enemy’s attack hitting you, the enemy rerolls the
attack roll and uses the lower result. If the triggering effect
was you failing a saving throw, you reroll the saving throw and
use the higher result.
### Lightning Qi [free-action] FEAT 20

## Monk

Prerequisites Qi Spells
Frequency Once per 10 minutes
Qi flows freely from within you. If your next action is to cast
a qi spell that takes at least two actions to cast, reduce the
number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).

127

Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and
servitude—you instead glean sacred truths and great mysteries embodied in
overarching concepts, whether because you perceive the common ground across
multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these
mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with
a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it, which you might
uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as punishment from the gods.

## Oracle


## Hit Points

8 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number
of HP by this number at 1st level and

## Class Dc

Trained in oracle class DC
During Combat Encounters...
You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing
miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting
divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your
allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might
wade into battle yourself.
During Social Encounters...
You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage
your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.
While Exploring...
You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing
your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery’s
power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around
you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights.
In Downtime...
You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine
wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the
subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You
could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful
following devoted to your mystery.
You might...
- View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.
- Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great
acts of magic.
- Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.
Others Probably...
- Don’t realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead
believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.
- Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed
by the gods.
- Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform
wondrous acts.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an oracle. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Oracle Spellcasting
You have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of
the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this
power spill forth in the form of divine magic. You are a
spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition
using the Cast a Spell activity. As an oracle, when you cast
spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly
as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your
own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as
religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind.
Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of
spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells
you can cast, as shown on the Oracle Spells per Day table
on page 131.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell
attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.
This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the
spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at
the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that
rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are
heightened to certain ranks (Player Core 297). The signature
spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.
Cantrips
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special
type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a
cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is
automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—
this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot
you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips
are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips
are 3rd-rank spells.
Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells
of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. You
choose these from the common spells on the divine list or
from other divine spells to which you have access. You can
cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot
of an appropriate spell rank.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see the Oracle Spells per Day
table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same
rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd

level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you
add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell
you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of
that spell.
Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire
are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your
spell repertoire, it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and
vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want
to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each
time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap
out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same
rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out
spells by retraining during downtime (Player Core 440).
Mystery
An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine
being. This power could come from a potent concept or
ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of
concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous
conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle’s mystery, a
source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.
Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your
mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus
spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you
a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the
divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse
that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power.
The following oracle mysteries are in this book.
Ancestors (page 135): Voices of past generations teach
and haunt you.
Battle (page 135): You embody the virtues upheld by
heroes of legend.
Bones (page 135): Death always seems near, and the dead
speak to you.
Cosmos (page 136): You draw power from the stars and
the spaces between.
Flames (page 136): You dance with fire and do your best
to remain unscorched by it.
Life (page 137): The teeming energies of life flow through
you out into the world.
Lore (page 137): You gain access to unparalleled,
overwhelming knowledge.
Tempest (page 137): Wind, waves, and storms rage at
your beck and call.
Revelation Spells
The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of
revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of focus spell.
It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your
focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can
regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the
Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your
mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing
how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who
came before you.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots.
Certain feats give you more focus spells.

131

The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold
is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can
never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells
appear in on page 298 of Player Core.
You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a
focus pool of 1 Focus Point. This spell is an initial revelation
spell determined by your mystery. You can learn additional
revelation spells through oracle feats.
Oracular Curse
As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated
divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting
via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special
benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your
mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more
cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens,
but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its
grip on your soul.
Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound
condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles.
Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound
ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a
cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you
increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after
the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only
a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound
condition can’t increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow
in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and
your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4.
Once saturated in divine power, your soul can’t absorb any
more, and so you can’t use a cursebound ability if you are
already at your maximum cursebound condition.
Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being
cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses.
You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces
your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a
Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of
divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or
remove the effects of your curse or any ability
with the cursebound trait by any means other
than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound
effect makes creatures concealed from you, you
can’t negate that concealed condition through a
magic item or spell, such as sure strike (though
you would still benefit from the other effects of
that item or spell). Likewise, cleanse affliction and similar
abilities don’t affect your curse at all.
At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat
determined by your mystery, and you can learn additional
cursebound abilities through oracle feats.
Oracle Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an
oracle class feat.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter,
you gain a skill feat. You must be trained
or better in the corresponding skill to select
a skill feat.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Signature Spells 3rd
Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly.
For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell
of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t
need to learn heightened versions of signature
spells separately; instead, you can heighten

these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at
a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its
lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If
you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with
any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it
(i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). You can also retrain
specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of
that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much
time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase to either become trained
in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one
skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at
15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill
in which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Expert Spellcaster 7th
The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over
time. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and
spell DCs increase to expert.
Mysterious Resolve 7th
The power of your mystery blazing in your soul makes it
harder for other powers to grip your mind. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Magical Fortitude 9th
Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
Divine Access 11th
Your mystery offers you strange access to spells typically
reserved for more conventional worshippers. Choose one
deity who grants one of your mystery’s granted domains.
Add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that
deity to your spell list, and to your spell repertoire as soon
as you can cast spells of the appropriate rank.
Major Curse 11th
You’ve learned to better tolerate the conflicting powers
wreaking havoc on your body. The maximum cursebound
value you can have increases from cursebound 2 to
cursebound 3.
Oracular Senses 11th
You have always been able to sense a bit more than others.
Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.
Weapon Expertise 11th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of
your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons
and unarmed attacks increase to expert.
Light Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency rank for light armor and
unarmored defense increases to expert.

## Key Terms

You’ll see these key terms in many oracle class features.
Cursebound: Abilities with this trait tighten your
oracular curse’s grasp on your soul in exchange for
divine insights, giving you the cursebound condition
(see below). When you use a cursebound ability, you
become cursebound 1, or if you were already cursebound,
you increase the value of your cursebound condition
by 1. As cursebound abilities are directly linked to your
oracular curse, you can’t use a cursebound ability if you
don’t have an oracular curse or if you are already at your
maximum cursebound value. You can’t mitigate or bypass
the drawbacks of any cursebound ability with spells or
other effects (see Oracular Curse on page 132), and the
effects of any cursebound ability end when you Refocus
and remove the cursebound condition.
Fortune and Misfortune: Fortune and misfortune
effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never
have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect
come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune
effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two
misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse
and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune
effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each
other out, and you roll normally.
Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a
spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
spellshape action itself.

## The Cursebound Condition

Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you
receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply
on your mystery’s powers. Cursebound is a condition
that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and
cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular
curse imposes unique negative effects depending on
your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound
condition only by Refocusing.

133

Premonition’s Reflexes 13th
A chill runs through your spine as danger strikes, giving
you a hair’s more time to dodge or cover yourself. Your
proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Weapon Specialization 13th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and 4
if you’re legendary.
Master Spellcaster 15th
You truly understand the deep and complex divine power
within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for spell
attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.
Extreme Curse 17th
You have mastered a precarious balance between the
conflicting divine powers of your mystery, allowing
you to tolerate a perilous degree of divine curse. The
maximum cursebound value you can have increases from
cursebound 3 to cursebound 4.
Greater Mysterious Resolve 17th
Your time spent in contemplation of the mysteries of
creation has given you a powerful mind and soul. Your
proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary.
When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical
success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will
save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save
against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
Legendary Spellcaster 19th
You can harness divine power at a level few others can
match. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers
and spell DCs increase to legendary.
Oracular Clarity 19th
You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power
behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to
miracles. Add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your
repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can
use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting.
You don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up,
unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-rank slots
with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you
cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the
Oracular Providence feat to gain a second slot.
Mysteries
Choose the divine mystery that fuels your mystical power.
Your mystery might represent a pantheistic devotion to all
the deities with power over the subject of your mystery,
veneration of a particular ideal, or a conduit to raw divine
energy. Whatever its origin and nature, your mystery
determines the revelation spells you can cast and the
oracular curse that overtakes your body. You learn skills
related to that mystery, gain access to a cantrip, and gain a
special benefit drawn from the combined divine knowledge
and experience of your mystery.

mysteries make you trained in more than one skill.
Oracle Feat You gain this 1st-level oracle feat. This is a
cursebound feat, so using it aggravates your oracular curse.
Ancestors
The voices of generations past speak to you, and you hear
their words. You might resent the constant interruption,
or you might revere the spirits of those who came before.
Perhaps you hail from a culture with strong ancestral
traditions, such as the Shoanti Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan),
a traditional dwarven community that worships Torag’s
family pantheon, or a group that reveres Erastil or Pharasma.
You might commune with powerful psychopomps who
shepherd souls to the afterlife, with the River of Souls itself,
or with those spirits who have become trapped outside of
the great cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their
whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening
your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows
them to meddle in your worldly affairs.

## Curse Of Ancestral Meddling


## Curse Divine Oracle Spirit

The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and
meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a wellintentioned
(but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as
punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional
means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a
mixture of the above. When you have the cursebound condition,
you are clumsy with a value equal to your cursebound value as
the spirits of your ancestors temporarily possess you and vie for
control in your mind, hindering your movements.
Battle
Warlike forces fill you with physical might and tactical
knowledge, aiming to have you uphold the glory of
combat, fight to improve the world, prepare against the
necessity of conflict, or endure the inevitability of war.
You might draw upon deities such as Gorum, Iomedae,
Rovagug, the Horseman of War Szuriel, the Queen of the
Night Eiseth, the Vudrani god Diomazul, and others, or
you might find power in the unending conflict between the
armies of Heaven and Hell, the Elemental Planes, the Outer
Gods, or even the collective spirits of those who fought in
wars over the ages.

### Curse Of The Mortal Warrior

## Curse Divine Oracle

You thrive in the thick of battle, but your mystery’s sheer focus
on the physical and material leaves your soul weak against the
tricks of spellcraft. You smell faintly of steel and blood no matter
how you try to remove or mask the scent, you appear more
imposing and muscular than you actually are, and you hear the
faint clash and clamor of battle in the distance at all times.
Cursebound 1 Spells have an easier time wounding you. You gain
weakness 2 to any damage dealt by a spell. Any immunity or
resistance you have to spells is suppressed. This applies only
to spells, not other magical abilities.
Cursebound 2 You take a –1 status penalty to saving throws
against spells.
Cursebound 3 Your weakness to spells is equal to your level.
Cursebound 4 Your status penalty to saving throws against
spells increases to –2.
Bones
Your mystery imparts an understanding of death and
undeath in all their macabre complexity. You might have
had a brush with death yourself—maybe even dying and
returning to life—or carry the touch of undeath in your
blood. If you commune with deities, you might speak with
guardians of death like Pharasma and the psychopomp
ushers (the most powerful among creatures that guide
souls through the afterlife); a bringer of death like the
Mantis God Achaekek or the Horseman of the Apocalypse
Charon; or a herald of undeath such as Urgathoa.
Granted Spells cantrip: void warp; 1st: grim tendrils; 2nd: false
vitality; 3rd: ghostly weapon

## Curse Of Living Death

### Curse Divine Oracle Void Vitality
Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and
using your powers furthers this unnatural living death, making
you susceptible to both void and vitality damage. You carry a
touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a
faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.
Cursebound 1 You gain weakness 2 to vitality and void damage.
You can be hurt by both vitality and void damage even if one
or the other normally has no effect on you. Any immunity or
resistance you have to vitality or void is suppressed.
Cursebound 2 You take a –1 status penalty to Fortitude saves.
Cursebound 3 Your weakness to vitality and void damage is
equal to 5 + your level.
Cursebound 4 Your status penalty to Fortitude saving throws
increases to –2.
Cosmos
Celestial bodies great and small exert influence on you,
giving you sublime cosmic power. Perhaps you see the
glittering stars as a divine blessing, or perhaps you feel
drawn to the infinitely dark spaces between. You might
uphold deities like Desna, Sarenrae, or the deific lovers
Shizuru and Tsukiyo who represent the sun and the moon—
or you might draw power from dark entities from beyond
the stars, like certain Outer Gods, or destructive gods of the
night like Zon-Kuthon or the rat goddess Lao Shu Po.
Granted Spells cantrip: light; 1st: dizzying colors; 2nd: darkness;

CURSE OF THE SKY’S CALL

## Curse Divine Oracle

Your body is drawn toward the heavens, making you lighter and
less substantial than you should be. Your eyes glow with starry
light, and your hair and clothing float and drift around you.
When you have the cursebound condition, you are enfeebled
with a value equal to your cursebound value, and you take a
status penalty to saves and DCs against all forms of forced
movement equal to your cursebound value.
Flames
Fire lives at the center of the world, the center of the
sun, and the center of civilization. You might revere this
elemental force, siphon power from the Elemental Plane of
Fire, or venerate a collection of deities such as Asmodeus,
Sarenrae, the Tian goddess of disasters and volcanoes Lady
Nanbyo, or the elemental lord of fire Ymeri.
Granted Spells cantrip: ignition; 1st: breathe fire; 2nd: blazing
bolt; 3rd: fireball
Revelation Spells initial: incendiary aura; advanced: whirling

## Flame Augur

wide-ranging spells.

## Curse Of Engulfing Flames


## Curse Divine Fire Oracle

Fires flare noticeably (though not dangerously) in your
presence, you occasionally smoke slightly, and your body
is almost painfully hot to the touch. When you have the
cursebound condition, you catch fire, taking persistent fire
damage equal to your cursebound value. The flames shed
light like a torch, and if you enter an environment where they
could not burn (such as underwater), you simply seethe with
flameless heat. The flames subside when you begin Refocusing
to assuage your curse or if you fall unconscious, but they
resume if your Refocus activity is interrupted or when you
return to consciousness.
Life
The never-ending flow of life force within living beings is
palpable to you. You might uphold the sanctity of life, or
perhaps you seek to undermine it. You might draw power
from the collective vitality of the world’s living creatures,
hold some connection to Creation’s Forge, or revere a
collection of deities including Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae,
and the god of medicine Qi Zhong.

## Curse Of Outpouring Life


## Curse Divine Oracle

Life energy flows outward from you and connects you to all
living things, but you expend your vital essence to do so. Your
presence comforts the ill and injured, causes scars to fade
slightly, spurs new growth in plants, and otherwise infuses your
surroundings with vitality. As your life force seeps outward, it
becomes more difficult to keep your body functioning. Magical
effects that restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal
to your level (minimum 1) times your cursebound value to the
number of HP you recover.
Lore
Knowledge and information come freely to you. You
might use this lore to gain power or perhaps to understand
the divine mysteries of the multiverse. You might have a
conduit to the fabled Akashic Record, maintain a subtle
telepathic connection to the collective subconscious of
all living creatures, or follow in the footsteps of deities
such as Abadar, Irori, Nethys, Irori’s scholarly nephew
Gruhastha, the fey triune goddess of fate Magdh, or the
aeon god figure known as the Monad.

## Curse Of Torrential Knowledge


## Curse Divine Oracle

You have a link to true divine knowledge, but your mortal mind
struggles to process and act on what you know. Loose materials
around you, such as dust, grains of rice, and droplets of water,
slowly shift to form strange runes or faint, indecipherable writing,
and you sometimes speak unintelligible truths or statements in
unknown languages without realizing it. You take a status penalty
to Perception checks and Will saving throws equal to your
cursebound value due to the torrential distractions of unaskedfor
knowledge flooding your mind. If you are cursebound 4,
you additionally can’t speak, use linguistic effects, or otherwise
communicate with your allies, and you are stupefied 1.
Tempest
The fury of the wind and waves pounds in your heart, whether
your power flows from natural storms, a conduit to the elemental
Planes of Air and Water, or through reverence of deities such
as Gozreh, the tengu god of storms Hei Feng, the pirate queen
Besmara, or the elemental lords of air and water.

## Curse Of Inclement Headwinds


## Curse Divine Oracle

The weather seems to always oppose you in ways large and
small. Even when you are calm and at rest, your hair and
clothing are inconveniently blown about by gentle winds,
you are slightly damp from the faintest drizzle, and your
touch often comes with a static shock. When you have the
cursebound condition, you are opposed by the elements, with
the following effects.
Cursebound 1 Lightning is drawn to you. You gain electricity
weakness 2 and electricity spells or effects that have
additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal
treat you as though you were wearing metal. Any immunity or
resistance you have to such spells and effects is suppressed.
Cursebound 2 Blowing winds impose a -2 circumstance penalty
to ranged attack rolls you make.
Cursebound 3 Your weakness to electricity is equal to 5 +
your level.
Cursebound 4 The raging winds push you back, imposing a -10-
foot status penalty to all your Speeds.

Oracle Feats
At every level that you gain an oracle feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level

### Foretell Harm [free-action] FEAT 1

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Frequency once per round
Requirements Your previous action was to Cast a non-cantrip
Spell that dealt damage.
Your magic echoes ominously as you glimpse injury in the target’s
future. At the beginning of your target’s next turn, it takes damage
equal to twice the triggering spell’s rank as a seemingly random
and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune
is of a type matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire
damage, a flame might spontaneous ignite on them or they might
burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily immune
to Foretell Harm for 24 hours.
### Glean Lore [one-action] FEAT 1

## Divine Oracle Secret

You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety
of potentially useful information. Attempt a Religion check
to understand the information you gain. The GM sets the DC
(similar to the DC to Recall Knowledge), potentially adjusting
the DC of the check for topics far removed from your mystery.
Critical Success You comprehend the lore accurately or gain a
useful clue from the divine about your situation.
Success You learn two pieces of information about the topic, one
true and one erroneous, but you don’t know which is which.
Failure You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or
misleading clue.
Critical Failure You recall two pieces of incorrect information or
gain two erroneous or misleading clues.
### Nudge The Scales [one-action] FEAT 1
### Cursebound Divine Healing Oracle Spirit
You lay a finger on the scales of life and death to heal a creature,
regardless of whether it’s living or undead. You restore Hit Points
equal to 2 + double your level to one creature within 30 feet.
In addition, you can mediate during your daily preparations
to place yourself on one side of the scales. Choose life or death.
If you align yourself with life, you are healed by vitality healing
effects, as normal for most living creatures; if you align yourself
with death, you gain the void healing ability, causing you to be
healed by void effects that restore Hit Points and any other
effects that restore Hit Points to undead creatures.
### Oracular Warning [free-action] FEAT 1
### Auditory Cursebound Divine Emotion Mental Oracle
Trigger You are about to roll initiative.
You have a premonition about impending danger that you use
to warn your allies. Each ally within 20 feet gains a +2 status
bonus to their initiative roll and gains temporary Hit Points equal
to half your level, which last for 1 minute. If you are cursebound
2 when you use Oracular Warning, the bonus increases to +3,
and if you are cursebound 3, the bonus increases to +4.
### Reach Spell [one-action] FEAT 1

## Concentrate Oracle Spellshape

You can extend your spells’ ranges. If the next action you use
is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range by
30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell
normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
### Whispers Of Weakness [one-action] FEAT 1

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Voices whisper to you how to best lay a creature low. You target
one creature within 60 feet; if it has any weaknesses, you learn
them, as well as which of its saving throw modifiers is lowest.
You also come to understand its movements, gaining a +2 status
bonus to your next attack roll (or skill check made as part of an
attack action) against that foe before the end of your turn. The
target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
### Widen Spell [one-action] FEAT 1

## Manipulate Oracle Spellshape

You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a
wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn’t have a duration,
increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a
burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with
a smaller radius isn’t affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone
or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to
the length of a larger cone or line.

## 2Nd Level


## Cantrip Expansion Feat 2


## Oracle

Study broadens your range of simple spells. Add two additional
cantrips from your spell list to your repertoire.
### Divine Aegis [reaction] FEAT 2

## Divine Oracle

Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but
you haven’t rolled yet.
A barrier offers protection against other magic but leaves you
exposed to divine energy. Until the beginning of your next turn,
you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against nondivine
magical effects, but you also take a –1 circumstance penalty
to saves against divine effects.

## Domain Acumen Feat 2


## Oracle

Every oracle’s mystery touches on a divine domain of the
deities that fuel it; you can access that power. Choose one of
the domains associated with your mystery for which you don’t
already have an initial domain spell. You gain an initial domain
spell from that domain, which you cast as a revelation spell.

Special You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a
different domain each time and gaining its domain spell as a
revelation spell.
### Meddling Futures [free-action] FEAT 2

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

You open yourself to the guidance of whatever spirits or powers
deign to help you. Roll 1d4 to see what type of spirit is drawn
to you. Your next action must be the type of action the spirit
prefers, but you also gain the listed benefit for the action as the
spirit guides you. If you attempt to use a different action, you
must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or the action is lost.
1 Warrior You must attempt a Strike. You gain a +1 status bonus
to your attack roll and a +2 status bonus to damage, or a +6
status bonus to damage if you are at least cursebound 3.
2 Adept You must attempt a Perception check or a skill action.
You gain a +1 status bonus to the check, or a +2 status bonus
if you are cursebound 3.
3 Sage You must attempt to Cast a Spell. You gain a status
bonus to the spell’s damage or healing equal to the spell’s
rank, or equal to the spell’s rank + 3 if you are at least
cursebound 3.
4 Wanderer You must attempt a Stride action, or a Fly, Climb, or
Burrow action if you have the relevant speed. You gain a +10-
foot status bonus to your Speed for the action, or a +20-foot
status bonus if you are at least cursebound 3.

## 4Th Level

### Bespell Strikes [free-action] FEAT 4

## Oracle

Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a noncantrip
spell.
You siphon spell energy into one weapon you’re wielding, or
into one of your unarmed attacks, such as a fist. Until the end
of your turn, the weapon or unarmed attack deals an extra
1d6 force damage and gains the divine trait if it didn’t have it
already. If the spell dealt a different type of damage, the Strike
deals this type of damage instead (or one type of your choice
if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).
### Knowledge Of Shapes [free-action] FEAT 4

## Cursebound Oracle Spellshape

Prerequisites Reach Spell or Widen Spell
Inspiration lets you surpass your preconceptions of your spells’
limits. You use Reach Spell or Widen Spell as a free action.
### Thousand Visions [free-action] FEAT 4

## Cursebound Oracle Prediction

You open your senses to numerous visions of the immediate
future. The visions grant you subtle details of your immediate
surroundings within 30 feet. Within this range, you don’t need

139

to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed creature, you’re
not off-guard to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you’re
off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition),
and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden
creature. Beyond 30 feet, the visions become overwhelmed with
too many possible futures, making all of your senses imprecise
beyond this range. The visions persist for 1 minute.

## 6Th Level


## Advanced Revelation Feat 6


## Oracle

Prerequisites initial revelation spell
Divine power reveals greater mysteries to you. You learn the
advanced revelation spell associated with your mystery.

## Gifted Power Feat 6


## Oracle

Your mystery grants you additional magic. You have an extra
spell slot of your highest rank, which you can use only to cast one
of your mystery’s granted spells, heightened to this rank.
Special If you have the divine access class feature or Mysterious
Repertoire feat, you can cast spells that you learned from those
abilities using the additional spell slot from Gifted Power.

## Spiritual Sense Feat 6


## Divine Oracle

You have a vague connection to the Ethereal Plane that enables
you to notice spirits. While you’re exploring but not Searching,
the GM rolls a secret check for you to find haunts that usually
require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on the Ethereal
Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual essence such as
celestials, fiends, and monitors.
You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits
inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet of you. This
applies while Searching, while Seeking, and on the automatic
secret check you gain while exploring even if you aren’t Searching.
You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you
can’t see them if they’re more than 5 feet inside an object. When
you notice a creature with this sense, you also learn its location,
making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.

## Steady Spellcasting Feat 6


## Oracle

Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your
concentration when you Cast a Spell. If another creature’s
reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC
15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.

## 8Th Level

### Debilitating Dichotomy [two-actions] FEAT 8
### Concentrate Cursebound Divine Mental Oracle
You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the
divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with
another’s conflicts as well. You and one creature within 30 feet

## Lifebringer

You focus on supportive magic, channel divine power into
healing energy for your allies to keep them standing.

each take 9d6 mental damage with a basic Will save, and the
target is stunned 1 if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of
success one better than you rolled for your saving throw. At 10th
level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 3d6.

## Read Disaster Feat 8


## Exploration Oracle Prediction

You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries
of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the
future. You gain the effects of augury, except you learn only
about the dangers ahead; any results of “good” are instead
“nothing,” and results of “mixed” are instead “bad.” If you are
legendary in Religion, you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
### Surging Might [one-action] FEAT 8

## Manipulate Oracle Spellshape

You focus the power of your spell to overcome enemies’
resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell
ignores an amount of the target’s resistance equal to your level
against the following types of damage: spirit, vitality, and void.
This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent
damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell. This
doesn’t cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.

## Water Walker Feat 8


## Oracle

When in the throes of your curse, your steps take on a
supernatural buoyancy. When you are cursebound 1, you can
Stride across liquids that don’t support your weight, but you
must end your movement on a surface that can support you or
you fall into the liquid as normal. When you are cursebound 2
or worse, you gain the effects of water walk.

## 10Th Level

### Quickened Casting [free-action] FEAT 10

## Concentrate Oracle Spellshape

Frequency once per day
If your next action is to cast an oracle cantrip or an oracle spell that
is at least 2 ranks lower than your highest-rank oracle spell slot,
reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
### Roll The Bones Of Fate [one-action] FEAT 10

## Cursebound Divine Oracle Prediction

Prerequisites bones or lore mystery
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You roll a handful of bones to learn (or perhaps influence) the
future course of events. Roll 1d4 and use the corresponding
result below. Whenever you Roll the Bones of Fate, any effects
from a previous usage immediately end.
1 Good You or an ally within 30 feet can roll twice on your
next attack roll or skill check, taking the higher result. This
is a fortune effect.
2 Bad One creature you are observing within 30 feet must
succeed at a Will save against your spellcasting DC; on a
failure, the target must roll twice on their next attack roll or
skill check that takes at least one action to perform, taking
the lower result. This is a misfortune effect.
3 Mixed You gain the benefits of rolling both a 1 and a 2.
4 Cursed Possibilities Your attempts to meddle in the forces
of prophecy bring dire consequences for all. Every creature
within 30 feet of you when you perform the augury rolls twice
on their next attack roll or skill check that takes at least one
action to perform; if the highest number rolled is odd, they take
the lower result, and if the highest number rolled is even, they
take the higher result. If they took the lower result, this effect
has the misfortune trait for them, and if they took the higher
result, it has the fortune trait.
### The Dead Walk [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Prerequisites ancestors or battle mystery
You beseech warrior spirits to come forth and aid you. Two
ghostly warriors manifest within a 30-foot emanation of you
and each attempt a Strike against an adjacent enemy, using your
spell attack modifier, and then disappear. The warriors’ Strikes
each deal 4d6 spirit damage and the warriors can flank with one
another and with you and your allies. If you are cursebound 2
when you use The Dead Walk, you instead summon three
warriors, and if you are cursebound 3, you instead summon four
warriors. The warriors disappear at the start of your next turn.
### Trial By Skyfire [one-action] FEAT 10

## Cursebound Divine Fire Oracle

Prerequisites cosmos or flames mystery
Your lips murmur as you portend a great disaster, one you
hope you survive. A rain of blazing bolts begins to fall from the
heavens in a 10-foot emanation, centered on you, that deals 2d6
fire damage to all creatures in the emanation at the end of each
of your turns (basic Reflex save); you can’t exclude yourself from
the emanation. The skyfire persists for 1 minute; while you can’t
Dismiss it, you can suppress the effect for 1 round with a Sustain
action. The rain of fire is suppressed if you fall unconscious. If
you become cursebound 3 or 4 at any point during Trial by
Skyfire’s duration, the emanation increases to 15 feet and the
damage increases to 4d6.
### Waters Of Creation [two-actions] FEAT 10
### Cursebound Divine Healing Oracle Vitality Water
Prerequisites life or tempest mystery
Water is the source of life, and you draw upon this primordial
force to heal your allies’ wounds. A gentle ring ripples out from
you in a 15-foot emanation, restoring 5d6 Hit Points to creatures
in the area. At 12th level and every two levels thereafter, the
amount restored increases by 1d6. If you are cursebound 3 when
you use Waters of Creation, the amount healed increases to d8s.

## 12Th Level


## Domain Fluency Feat 12


## Oracle

Prerequisites Domain Acumen

141

You command a deep understanding of the domains related to
your mystery. Choose one of the domains associated with your
mystery for which you have an initial domain spell. You gain an
advanced domain spell from that domain, which you cast as a
revelation spell.
### Epiphany At The Crossroads [free-action] FEAT 12

## Divine Oracle

Frequency once per day
Trigger Your turn begins.
Requirements You are unconscious and have the dying condition.
The crossroads between life and death is a place that can reveal
many secrets. You gain the effects of an augury spell in a strange,
near-death vision. Empowered by the realization, you then lose
the dying condition (becoming wounded 1 or increasing your
wounded value by 1, as normal), regain a number of Hit Points
equal to twice your level, and can Stand.

## Greater Revelation Feat 12


## Oracle

Prerequisites initial revelation spell
You unlock deeper revelations hidden within your mystery. You
gain your mystery’s greater revelation spell.

## Magic Sense Feat 12


## Detection Divine Oracle

You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.
You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were
always using a 1st-rank detect magic spell. This detects magic in
your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of
a 3rd-rank detect magic spell on things you observe (in addition
to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off
and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

## 14Th Level

### Forestall Curse [free-action] FEAT 14

## Concentrate Oracle

You’ve learned to hold back your curse. If the next action you use
is a cursebound ability, your cursebound value doesn’t increase.
### Lighter Than Air  FEAT 14

## Divine Oracle

Prerequisites Water Walker
Your mysterious steps become even lighter, transcending
the mortal world altogether. When you have the cursebound
condition, you gain the effects of fly. If you are cursebound 3
or greater, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed.

## Mysterious Repertoire Feat 14


## Oracle

Your mystery holds unknowable depths of magic not always
associated with the divine. You can have one spell in your spell
repertoire not on the divine spell list, in addition to spells you’ve
added to your spell list from abilities like divine access. You cast

## Guided Blade

Your mystery guides your weapons in the trance of
battle. You use your magic primarily to empower
yourself, rather than targeting your enemies, so that
your Strikes hit home.
Attribute Scores
Since you’ll be using your spells on yourself more
than your enemies, aim for a broader balance of
Charisma with Strength or Dexterity, as suits your
chosen weapon. Higher Constitution will improve your

that spell as a divine spell. You can swap which spell you add
and from which tradition as you could any other oracle spell, but
you can’t use this feat to have more than one spell from another
tradition in your spell repertoire at the same time.

## Revelation’S Focus Feat 14


## Oracle

The further extents of your mystery provide an endless
wellspring of magic. When you Refocus, you regain all your
Focus Points instead of 1.

## 16Th Level

### Conduit Of Void And Vitality [two-actions] FEAT 16

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Prerequisites any oracle mystery
Requirements You have heal or harm as a signature spell and
an available spell slot to cast it with.
You use the unstable energy of your curse to manipulate the
most basic of divine magic. You cast a 3-action heal or harm spell,
expending the slot as normal. If the spell restores Hit Points to
one or more creatures, then one creature healed by this spell
regains a number of additional Hit Points equal to 1d8 × your
cursebound value; if the spell damages one or more creatures,
then one creature harmed by this spell takes additional damage
equal to 1d8 × your cursebound value.

## Diverse Mystery Feat 16


## Oracle

Prerequisites Advanced Revelation
You have broadened your understanding of the divine and can
tap into the wonders of a different mystery. Select one revelation
spell from a mystery other than your own. You can choose only
an initial revelation spell or an advanced revelation spell.
This spell gains the cursebound trait for you, and when you
cast it, you gain the cursebound 1 effects of its mystery in
addition to your normal curse effects. Any ability that lets you
use a cursebound ability without increasing the severity of your
curse also prevents you from gaining this additional curse effect.
You can’t cast your chosen revelation spell if any of the
following conditions are true: its mystery’s curse effects directly
conflict with or negate the effects of your own mystery’s curse,
the curse would have no effect on you (for example, removing
an ability from your original mystery that you lack), or if either
of these criteria would be met once you finish Casting the Spell.
### Portentous Spell [one-action] FEAT 16
### Manipulate Mental Oracle Spellshape Visual
Your spellcasting is rife with strange lights, mild fumes, and
other captivating effects that befuddle your foes. If the next
action you use is to Cast a Spell, any creature that attempts to
use a reaction triggered by your Cast a Spell activity takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks rolled as
part of the reaction. In addition, if the spell includes a spell attack
or requires a saving throw, creatures you hit or that fail their
saves are fascinated with you until the start of your next turn.

## 18Th Level

### Blaze Of Revelation [free-action] FEAT 18

## Oracle

Requirements You are cursebound 4.
Your mind and body can, for a short time and with great peril,
surpass the final limits of your curse. For 1 minute, you shed
torrential flames, become surrounded by spirits, or otherwise
overflow with divine power in a way that suits your mystery. On
each of your turns during that time, you can cast one revelation
spell without spending Focus Points.
At the end of the minute, the durations of any revelation
spells you cast during that time end, and you must attempt a
DC 40 Fortitude save.
Critical Success You aren’t otherwise affected.
Success You are drained 2 and can’t reduce or remove this
condition until your next preparations.
Failure You are drained 4 and can’t reduce or remove this
condition until your next preparations.
Critical Failure You die.

## Divine Effusion Feat 18


## Oracle

The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of
divine energy, even when your own magic dwindles. Twice per
day, you can cast a spell after you’ve run out of spell slots of
the appropriate spell rank; the two spells you cast with this feat
must be of different spell ranks.

## 20Th Level

### Mystery Conduit [free-action] FEAT 20

## Cursebound Oracle Spellshape

The power of your mystery enables you access to myriad magic.
If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th rank or lower that has
no duration, you do not expend a spell slot.

## Oracular Providence Feat 20


## Oracle

Prerequisites oracular clarity
Your mystery grants you access to deep reserves of truly
miraculous divine power. You gain an additional 10th-rank
spell slot.

## Paradoxical Mystery Feat 20


## Oracle

Prerequisites Greater Revelation
The truest depths of your divine mystery are fathomless
and contradictory, granting you changing powers that even
you can barely begin to fathom. Each day during your daily
preparations, choose one basic or advanced domain spell
from any domain from Player Core, one of the domains
granted by your mystery, another domain to which you
have access, or any initial or advanced revelation spell from
another mystery. You gain that spell as a revelation spell
until your next daily preparations.

You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There’s magic
in your blood. Perhaps a divine influence blessed one of your ancestors, a
forebear communed with an ancient, primordial entity, or a powerful occult
ritual performed long ago influenced your lineage. Self-reflection and study
allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities.
The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of
whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.

During combat encounters...
You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper
their movements. You might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee
combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your
own in a brawl. While your magic is strong, you also rely on cantrips in
order to conserve your more powerful spells for the right moment (or after
you’ve used such spells up).
During social encounters...
Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.
While exploring...
You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your party of
magical traps. When your group encounters mysteries or problems related to
your bloodline, you try to solve them.
In downtime...
You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to
research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.
You might...
- Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject
your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a
spellcaster and as an individual.
- View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—
anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.
- Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your
limited selection of spells.
Others probably...
- Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your
abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.
- Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics,
and other disciplined practitioners of magic, since power comes to you
naturally.
- Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if
your personality proves otherwise.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a sorcerer. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Bloodline
Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.
This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the
spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you
learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus
Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The
bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.
Aberrant: A strange and unknowable influence gives
you occult spells.
Angelic: Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.
Demonic: A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.
Diabolic: A bond with devils gives you divine spells.
Draconic: The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.
Elemental: The power of the elements manifests in you
as primal spells.
Fey: Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.
Hag: The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.
Imperial: An ancient power grants you arcane spells.
Undead: The touch of death gives you divine spells.
See Bloodlines on page 149 for more information.
Sorcerer Spellcasting
Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical
power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the
Cast a Spell activity (Player Core 299). The tradition from
which your spells come is determined by your bloodline.
As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the
gestures and incantations you use to shape your power
might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a
sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural
fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.
Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of
spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells
you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table
on page 147.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell
attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403
of Player Core.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.
This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the
spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at
the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that
rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they
are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class
feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.

Cantrips
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type
of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip
at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always
automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—
this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell
slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your
cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer,
your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.
Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of
your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as
an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (page
149). You choose these from the common spells from the
tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other
spells from that tradition to which you have access. You
can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell
slot of an appropriate spell rank.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per
Day table above), you add a spell to your spell repertoire
of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your
first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that
rank that’s listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the
other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell;
at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and
two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells,
you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already
know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it
wouldn’t give you another spell slot or vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you
might want to replace some of the spells you previously
learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells,
you can swap out one of your old spells for a different
spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but
you can’t swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap
out spells by retraining during downtime (Player Core
440).
Sorcerous Potency
Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your
spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other
spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots
that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain
a status bonus to that spell’s damage or healing equal to
the spell’s rank. This applies only to the initial damage or
healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature
takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once
per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that
creature multiple times.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat (Player Core 249). You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

Sorcerer Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a sorcerer class feat. These begin on page 152.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general
feat (Player Core 249).
Signature Spells 3rd
Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells
more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose
one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need
to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately;
instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned
a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell
rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also
retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different
spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as
much time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in
one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency
rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at
15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill
in which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Magical Fortitude 5th
Magical power has improved your body’s
resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves
increases to expert.
Expert Spellcaster 7th
Your inherent magic responds easily and
powerfully to your command. Your proficiency
ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs
increase to expert.
Reflex Expertise 9th
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency
rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Perception Expertise 11th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your
proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.
Weapon Expertise 11th
You’ve improved your combat skill. Your
proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed
attacks increase to expert.
Defensive Robes 13th
The flow of magic and your defensive training
combine to help you avoid attacks. Your
proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases
to expert.
Weapon Specialization 13th
You’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with
your most practiced weapons. You deal
2 additional damage with weapons and
unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.
This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master,
and 4 if you’re legendary.

Master Spellcaster 15th
You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood.
Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell
DCs increase to master.
Majestic Will 17th
Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of
magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves
increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will
save, you get a critical success instead.
Bloodline Paragon 19th
You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add
two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your
repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can
use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike
other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as
you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let
you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities
that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline
Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.
Legendary Spellcaster 19th
You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your
proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs
increase to legendary.
Bloodlines
Your bloodline determines your spell list, the tradition of
spells you cast, and grants you access to two trained skills.
Bloodline Spells
Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells
unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus
spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you
start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your
focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can
regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the
Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don’t need
to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing
through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.
These spells can be found starting on page 262.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots; you can’t cast them using spell slots.
The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is
equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can
never be more than 3 points. The full rules are on page
298 of Player Core.
You learn the initial bloodline spell, which is unique to
your bloodline.
Reading a Bloodline Entry
A bloodline entry contains the following information.
Tradition You use this magical tradition and spell list; Bloodline
Skills You become trained in the listed skills.
Sorcerous Gifts You automatically add the spells listed here
to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire
feature listed on page 147. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and
a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon
as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.
Bloodline Spells You automatically gain the initial bloodline
spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the
Advanced Bloodline (page 154) and Greater Bloodline (page
154) feats.
Blood Magic Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a
Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you
choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from.
You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and
can gain others through sorcerer feats.
If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before
resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after
resolving any checks for the spell’s initial effects and, against
a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the
foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must
designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the
spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references
to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.
Aberrant
Something ancient and unknowable speaks to you from
beyond the stars or below the earth.

Blood Magic—Eerie Veil An ominous pall spills from your mind.
Either one target takes a –1 status penalty to Will saving
throws for 1 round or you gain a +2 status bonus to Will
saving throws for 1 round.

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities.
Blood Magic: Casting a sorcerous gift spell granted by
your bloodline or a bloodline spell allows you to benefit
from a blood magic effect you know. You can typically only
benefit from one blood magic effect at a time, though some
feats and abilities may change this.
Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a
spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
spellshape action itself.

## Sorcerer

Trigger A creature targets you with a spell of the same tradition
as your bloodline.
The magic in your blood surges in response to your foe’s spell. You
generate a blood magic effect you know, even if you are already
under the effects of blood magic. The target must be either you

of your bloodline.

## Concentrate Sorcerer Spellshape

You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you

to 30 feet.
### Tap Into Blood [one-action] FEAT 1

Requirements You are benefiting from a blood magic effect
The power in your blood allows you to perform minor feats of
magic. You can perform one of the following actions depending
on the tradition of your bloodline.
- Arcane Your mind temporarily opens to the secrets of the
world. Attempt to Recall Knowledge; you can use Arcana
instead of the skill normally needed for that subject. If
you critically fail at this check, you get a failure instead.
- Divine Whatever divine provenance is in your lineage
guides you to instinctively move yourself or others out
of harm’s way. You Step, or you Reposition a target within
your reach using Religion for the check.

that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a

you or an ally would gain a blood magic effect, you can forgo it,

target of your spell. You can anoint only one ally at a time; if you
place another rune, your previous designation ends.
### Bleed Out [one-action] FEAT 2

Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip
spell that granted you a blood magic effect.

of spells. During your daily preparations, you can choose one
spell in your spell repertoire to be a signature spell that day. You
can use the Learn a Spell activity to add more arcane spells to the
list you choose from, but if you prepare a spell that isn’t in your
repertoire, you temporarily add it to your repertoire at the spell
rank of your choice instead of making it a signature spell.

## Sorcerer

Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a noncantrip
spell.
You siphon spell energy into one weapon you’re wielding or
into one of your unarmed attacks, such as a fist. Until the end
of your turn, the weapon or unarmed attack deals an extra 1d6
force damage and gains the trait of your bloodline’s magical

types of damage).

Prerequisites bloodline that grants divine spells
The divine might provided by your bloodline flows through you.

in your spell repertoire.

### Split Shot [one-action] FEAT 4

## Concentrate Sorcerer Spellshape

You fragment a ranged spell. If your next action is to Cast a Spell
without a duration that requires an attack roll against a single
target, you can choose a second target within range. You roll a
single attack roll and compare the result to the AC of both targets.

vitality, or void) equal to 4 + the rank of the spell.
### Safeguard Spell [one-action] FEAT 6

range.

from your space instead of their own.

## Steady Spellcasting Feat 6


## Sorcerer

You are confident in your spellcasting technique, and you are
more easily able to retain your concentration when you Cast a
Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt
a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.

Blood Magic—Explosion of Power Raw power explodes outward
from you. Each creature within a 5-foot emanation takes

save). The type of damage depends on the tradition of your
bloodline. If you cast arcane spells, you deal force damage.
If you cast divine spells, you deal spirit damage. If you cast
occult spells, you deal mental damage. If you cast primal
spells, you deal fire damage.

## 10Th Level

### Energy Fusion [one-action] FEAT 10

## Concentrate Sorcerer Spellshape

You fuse two spells together, combining their energy types. If the
next action you use is to Cast a Spell that deals energy damage,
select a non-cantrip spell in your spell repertoire that deals a
different type of energy damage, and expend an additional spell
slot of the same rank as this secondary spell. The spell you cast
deals additional damage equal to the rank of the secondary spell
slot expended. The spell’s total damage is divided evenly between
the energy type of the spell you cast and the energy type of the
secondary spell.

greater freedom. You gain two additional signature spells, each
of which must have a base rank of 3rd or lower.

You wield blood magic masterfully. When you would benefit
from a blood magic effect, you can choose to lose Hit Points

two different blood magic effects you know as a result. The two
effects can have different targets.

choose to do so. Your spells can affect creatures on the Ethereal
Plane, though this doesn’t grant you the ability to locate them.

## Magic Sense Feat 12


## Detection Sorcerer

You have a literal sixth sense for magic. You can sense the
presence of magic auras as though you were always using a
1st-rank detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of
vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-rank
detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal
benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a
free action at the start or the end of your turn.

your bloodline.

cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.

During social encounters...
You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might
be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do
the talking.
While exploring...
You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared
to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment
in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.
In downtime...
You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments,
or train to learn new techniques and stunts. To maintain your impressive
reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a
following of admirers.
You might...
- Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing
you can live up to the image you present.
- Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your
reputation.
- Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow
rusty.
Others probably...
- Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.
- Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your
flamboyant style.
- Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of
your deadly blade.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a swashbuckler. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent
your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.
Panache
You care as much about the way you accomplish something
as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place.
When you perform an action with particular style, you can
leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly
maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.
You gain panache by performing actions that have the
bravado trait. Tumble Through (Player Core 233) and
additional actions determined by your swashbuckler’s style
(see below) gain the bravado trait when you use them. The
GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly
daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding
down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks
typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial
DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat
encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.
Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher
(page 161), can be used only while you have panache and
cause you to lose your panache.
Precise Strike
When you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee
weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2
additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher,
the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.
As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your
additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and
17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a
Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6.
Stylish Combatant
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the
bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have
panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds.
Swashbuckler’s Style
Your own distinctive style lets you gracefully handle
any situation. Choose a swashbuckler’s style. This style
determines the additional actions you use to gain panache
and makes you trained in the skill related to that action.
Battledancer
To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you
command your foes’ attention with mesmerizing motions.
You are trained in Performance and gain the Fascinating
Performance skill feat (Player Core 255). When you
Perform, the action gains the bravado trait.
Braggart
You boast, taunt, and psychologically needle your foes.
You are trained in Intimidation. When you Demoralize, the
action gains the bravado trait.

Fencer
You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to
lead your foes into inopportune attacks. You are trained
in Deception. When you Create a Distraction or Feint, the
action gains the bravado trait.
Gymnast
You reposition, maneuver, and bewilder your foes with
daring feats of physical prowess. You are trained in
Athletics. When you Grapple, Reposition, Shove, or Trip,
the action gains the bravado trait.
Rascal
You aren’t afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the
edge over your opponents. You are trained in Thievery
and gain the Dirty Trick general feat (page 229). When
you use Dirty Trick, the action gains the bravado trait.
Wit
You are friendly, clever, and full of humor, always
knowing just what to say. Your witticisms leave foes
unprepared for the skill and speed of your attacks. You
are trained in Diplomacy and gain the Bon Mot skill feat
(page 228). When you use Bon Mot, the action gains the
bravado trait.
Confident Finisher
You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when
you have panache. The finisher trait is described on page
163. You gain the Confident Finisher action.
### Confident Finisher [one-action]

## Finisher Swashbuckler

## 1St Level

You knock weapons from the hands of your foes with style.
When you Disarm, the action gains the bravado trait.

## Elegant Buckler Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

You’ve learned a flexible way to position your buckler to
provide more protection. When you Raise a Shield to gain a

Requirements You’re wielding one or more one-handed weapons
You use one-handed weapons to parry with style. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, or a
+2 circumstance bonus if you have a free hand or are wielding

Requirements You aren’t encumbered.
You deftly dodge out of the way, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus

## Flying Blade Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites precise strike
You apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as
melee attacks. You apply your precise strike damage on ranged
Strikes you make with a thrown weapon within that weapon’s
first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or
finesse weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon
ranged Strike for Confident Finisher and any other finisher that
includes a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike.

## Focused Fascination Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Fascinating Performance
When you use Fascinating Performance in a combat encounter,
you need only a success, rather than a critical success, to
fascinate your target. This works only if you’re attempting
to fascinate one target. For example, if you were an expert in

## Key Terms

You’ll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities.
Bravado: Actions with this trait can grant panache,
depending on the result of the check involved. If you
succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain
panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check,
you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn.
These effects can be applied even if the action had no other
effect due to a failure or a creature’s immunity.
Finisher: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that
use your panache. Finishers can be used only with weapons
that deal additional damage with precise strike (agile
or finesse melee weapons or unarmed attacks, for most
swashbucklers). You can use a finisher only if you have
panache, and you lose your panache immediately after
performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can’t use
actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.
Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure.
Effects added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If
your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply
the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this
when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.
Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special
techniques that require too much exertion for you to
perform frequently. You can use only one action with the
flourish trait per round.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action
again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with
the stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round. You
can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can
Dismiss a stance.

163

Performance, you could choose to target multiple creatures
normally or target one creature and fascinate it on a success.

## Goading Feint Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites trained in Deception
Your tricks make foes overextend their attacks. On a Feint, you
can use the following success and critical success effects instead
of any other effects you would gain when you Feint; if you do,
other abilities that adjust the normal effects of your Feint no
longer apply. You can choose whether to use the Goading Feint
benefits or the normal benefits each time you Feint a given foe.
Critical Success The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to
all attack rolls against you before the end of its next turn.
Success The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its next
attack roll against you before the end of its next turn.
### One For All [one-action] FEAT 1
### Auditory Concentrate Emotion Linguistic Mental Swashbuckler
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster
an ally’s efforts. Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action
counts as sufficient preparation to Aid that ally. When you use
the Aid reaction to help that ally, you can roll Diplomacy in place
of the usual check and the action gains the bravado trait.

## Plummeting Roll Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
Trigger You fall.
Through nimble movements, a graceful landing, and a bit of
luck, you can manage to fall from spectacular heights without a
scratch. You gain the Cat Fall skill feat and the following reaction.
Plummeting Roll [reaction] Trigger You fall at least 10 feet and take no
damage from the fall; Effect You tuck and roll with the motion.
You land on your feet and Stride up to half your Speed.
YOU’RE NEXT [one-action] FEAT 1

Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
Trigger You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points.
After downing a foe, you promise another that you’re coming
after them next. Attempt an Intimidation check with a +2
circumstance bonus to Demoralize a single creature that you
can see and that can see you. If you’re legendary in Intimidation,
you can use this as a free action with the same trigger.

your foes how little attention they require. When you Perform, you

as well as the auditory and linguistic trait as normal for oration.

attack rolls against creatures other than you until the end of
its next turn.
Success The target takes a –1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls
against creatures other then you until the end of its next turn.
Critical Failure The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to
attack rolls targeting you until the end of its next turn.

## Finishing Follow-Through Feat 2

You make a calculated attack without letting down your guard.
Make a melee Strike with the following failure effect.
Failure You Step as a free action.

165

Requirements You are wielding a single one-handed melee

foes. One foe must be adjacent to you, and the other foe must

Prerequisites expert in Athletics
Your easily maneuver against your foes. Your Disarm, Grapple,
Reposition, Shove, and Trip actions have a lower multiple attack
penalty. Even if your weapon or unarmed attack doesn’t have the
agile trait, the penalty is –4 if the action is your second attack
on your turn, or –8 if it’s your third or subsequent attack. If your

attack on your turn, instead of –5 and –10, respectively.

## Swashbuckler

## Swashbuckler

Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action
or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
You swat a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike

This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty,
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
### Vexing Tumble [one-action] FEAT 6

## Bravado Swashbuckler

You tumble around your foes, expertly avoiding their reactions.
Stride up to half your Speed and roll an Acrobatics check.
Compare the result to the Reflex DC of each enemy whose reach
you began in or enter during the movement, in sequence.

## 8Th Level

### Bleeding Finisher [one-action] FEAT 8

## Finisher Swashbuckler

Your blow inflicts profuse bleeding. Make a slashing or piercing
Strike. If you hit, the target also takes persistent bleed damage
equal to your precise strike finisher damage.

### Distracting Toss [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Bravado Flourish Swashbuckler

You toss one weapon into the air as a distraction as you throw
another. Choose a creature within 30 feet and Feint against it;
you can attempt this Feint even if the target is not within melee
range, and if the target becomes off-guard as a result of the Feint,
this applies to your thrown weapon attacks for the duration.
Regardless of the result, you can then Interact to draw a thrown
weapon and make a thrown weapon Strike against the target. If
you have an open hand, you then catch the weapon you originally
tossed into the air unless you critically failed at your attempt to
Feint, in which case it lands on the ground at your feet.
### Dual Finisher [one-action] FEAT 8

## Finisher Swashbuckler

Requirements You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.
You split your attacks. Make two melee Strikes, one with each

your multiple attack penalty only after attempting both Strikes.

## Flashy Roll Feat 8


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Flashy Dodge
You can use Flashy Dodge before attempting a Reflex save, in
addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance bonus
applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.
When you use Flashy Dodge and the triggering attack fails
or critically fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at
the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part of the
reaction. If you do, the reaction gains the move trait. You can
use Flashy Roll while Flying or Swimming instead of Striding if
you have the corresponding movement type.
### Stunning Finisher [one-action] FEAT 8

## Finisher Swashbuckler

You attempt a dizzying blow. Make a melee Strike. If you hit,
your foe must attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC
with the following results; the save has the incapacitation trait.

somehow tends to work out. When you already have panache,
you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which
the circumstance bonus from stylish combatant applies (Tumble
Through and any skill actions with the bravado trait).

## Reflexive Riposte Feat 10

stumbling back. Make a Strike. If you hit, the target is pushed 5
feet back (or 10 feet on a critical hit).
### Switcheroo [reaction] FEAT 10

## Swashbuckler

Trigger You are targeted by a ranged attack.
Requirements You are adjacent to an enemy and have panache.
You attempt to deftly swap places with an adjacent enemy to
avoid the attack. Choose an adjacent enemy and attempt to
Reposition it. Instead of the normal results of Reposition, use
the following.
Critical Success You swap places with the target enemy and the
enemy becomes the target of the triggering attack.
Success As critical success, except the target has lesser cover
against the triggering attack, and you lose your panache.
Failure You lose your panache.
Critical Failure You become off-guard against the triggering
attack, and you lose your panache.
### Targeting Finisher [one-action] FEAT 10

## Finisher Swashbuckler

Your attack harms and hinders your foe. Choose a particular
part of your foe from the list below and Strike. If you hit and

enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
- Head The target is stupefied 2. On a critical hit, it is also

## 12Th Level

### Cheat Death [reaction] FEAT 12

## Swashbuckler

Trigger You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
Somehow you always escape the reaper by a hair’s breadth.
You avoid being knocked out or killed and remain at 1 Hit Point
and gain panache, but you become doomed 1 (or increase your
doomed value by 1 if you were already doomed). You can’t
reduce or ignore the doomed condition from Cheating Death.
The doomed condition from Cheating Death lasts for 10 minutes,
though this doesn’t affect the duration of any other doomed
condition you have.
### Get Used To Disappointment [free-action] FEAT 12

## Bravado Swashbuckler

Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
Requirements Your turn begins, and one target within 30 feet
failed an attack roll or skill check against you on its last turn.
You capitalize on an opponent’s failure with smug attitude
and swagger, reminding them of the gap in skill between you
and your opponent. You attempt to Demoralize the opponent.
Regardless of the result, the target becomes temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
### Mobile Finisher [one-action] FEAT 12

## Finisher Swashbuckler

You attack in motion. Stride and then Strike. You can use Mobile
Finisher while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or
Swimming instead of Striding if you have the
corresponding movement type.
### The Bigger They Are [one-action] FEAT 12

## Bravado Swashbuckler

With reckless speed, you dash, jump and swing around a
creature to find a more vulnerable spot. Attempt to Tumble
Through a creature at least one size category larger than you,
using the following effects.
Critical Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating
the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs
10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to
move all the way through its space, you get the same effect
as a failure. If you successfully pass through the target’s
square, the target gains weakness to your precision damage
equal to half your level, which lasts until the end of your turn.
Success As success, but the weakness applies only against the
next attack you make against the target.
Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you
had moved out of the square you started in.
Critical Failure As failure, and you fall prone.

## 14Th Level

### Flamboyant Leap [two-actions] FEAT 14

## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites master in Athletics, Flamboyant Athlete

## Fencer

You befuddle your foes with deft movements, feints, and
traps, leading them into your cunning counterattacks.
Attributes
Prioritize Dexterity for accuracy, as well as Charisma
for Deception.
Skills
Acrobatics, Deception, Diplomacy, Society, Stealth,
Thievery
Swashbuckler’s Style
Fencer
Starting Feat
Goading Feint
Higher-Level Feats
Tumble Behind (2nd), Reactive Strike (6th), Reflexive
Riposte (10th), Felicitous Riposte (16th)
Sample Swashbuckler

Requirements You are capable of using a finisher.
You stylishly leap and deliver a powerful finisher. Make a
Leap, High Jump, or Long Jump and attempt one single-action
finisher at any point during your jump; the finisher can’t be
one that includes other movement, such as Mobile Finisher.
Immediately after the finisher, you fall to the ground if you’re
in the air, even if you haven’t reached the maximum distance
of your jump. If the distance you fall is no more than the height
of your jump, you take no damage and land upright. When
attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a Flamboyant
Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and increase
the maximum distance to double your Speed, rather than just
your Speed.

## Impossible Riposte Feat 14


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your ripostes can deflect attacks back at their source. You can
use Opportune Riposte with a trigger of “A foe outside of your
reach critically fails an attack roll against you” in addition to its
usual trigger. When you use Opportune Riposte with this new
trigger against a ranged attack, your Strike deflects some of the
triggering effect back toward its source. Compare the result of
your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On a hit, you deal
the normal amount of damage for your Strike, but the damage
type changes to that of the triggering attack. For instance, if
you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a blazing bolt, your Strike
would deal fire damage instead of its normal damage type.
### Perfect Finisher [one-action] FEAT 14

## Finisher Fortune Swashbuckler

You focus your panache into an impeccable assault. Make a
Strike, rolling the attack roll twice and using the better result.

## 16Th Level


## Deadly Grace Feat 16


## Swashbuckler

Your graceful attacks are especially powerful. When you score
a critical hit with an agile or finesse melee weapon that has
the deadly trait, you double the number of dice from that trait.
When you wield an agile or finesse melee weapon that doesn’t
have the deadly trait, it gains the deadly d8 trait instead.

## Felicitous Riposte Feat 16


## Fortune Swashbuckler

You take advantage of your foe’s openings with uncanny odds.
When you make an Opportune Riposte, roll twice on the attack
roll and take the better result.
### Revitalizing Finisher [one-action] FEAT 16

## Finisher Swashbuckler

Your swagger instills confidence in you and your allies. Make a
Strike. On a hit, you and all allies within 30 feet gain temporary
Hit Points equal to half your level.
Failure You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level.

## 18Th Level


## Incredible Luck Feat 18


## Fortune Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Charmed Life
You always seem to bounce back from the worst. When you use
Charmed Life, roll the save twice (including the +2 circumstance
bonus from Charmed Life) and use the better result.
### Lethal Finisher [one-action] FEAT 18

## Death Finisher Swashbuckler

Prerequisites precise strike 6d6
You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them outright.
Make a Strike. On a success, you forego your precise strike
damage from the finisher. Instead, your target takes additional
precision damage based on a Fortitude save against your class
DC. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target’s saving throw
outcome is one degree worse.
Critical Success You deal 6 precision damage.
Success You deal 6d6 precision damage.
Failure You deal 12d6 precision damage.
Critical Failure You deal 18d6 precision damage.
### Parry And Riposte  FEAT 18

## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest
provocation. You can use Opportune Riposte against an enemy
who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically fails),
provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher
on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC
from the parry weapon trait, or Extravagant Parry.

## 20Th Level

### Illimitable Finisher [one-action] FEAT 20

## Finisher Fortune Swashbuckler

Requirement You are not fatigued.
Your strikes flow endlessly. Step and attempt a single one-action
finisher. This Strike gains the bravado trait, possibly replenishing
your panache; if you regain panache, you can immediately
attempt another finisher as part of this action, ignoring the
restriction of using actions with the attack trait after a finisher.

## Inexhaustible Countermoves Feat 20


## Swashbuckler

At the start of each enemy’s turn, you gain an extra reaction you
can use only during that turn to perform an Opportune Riposte,
or a Reactive Strike if you have that reaction.

## Panache Paragon Feat 20


## Swashbuckler

You find opportunities to perform stylish feats in the moments
between others’ heartbeats and eye blinks. You are permanently
quickened. You can use the extra action only to perform a
bravado action.

New Familiar Abilities
Item Delivery: If your familiar is adjacent to you, you
can Command it to deliver an item. Instead of its normal
2 actions, your familiar Interacts to take an item you’re
holding of light Bulk or less, then takes one move action,
then finally Interacts to pass off the item to another willing
creature. It can instead administer the item to the creature
if it can do so with 1 action and has an appropriate type
of item (such as alchemical elixir). If your familiar doesn’t
reach the target this turn, it holds the item until commanded
otherwise. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity
ability to select this.
Poison Reservoir: Your familiar has a reservoir for
poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison to an adjacent
ally’s exposed weapon with a single Interact action. You
must supply the poison and instill it into this reservoir
using two consecutive Interact actions. You must have a
homunculus familiar to select this ability.
Second Opinion: Your familiar is your academic
confidant. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains
1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only
to Aid you on a Recall Knowledge skill check for a skill
in which it has the skilled familiar ability (it still has to
prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It
automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those
skills or automatically critically succeeds if you’re a master
of the skill in question. Your familiar must have the skilled
ability to select this.
New Master Abilities
Extra Alchemy: Your familiar helps you brew items at the
start of the day. You can create one additional item with
advanced alchemy during your daily preparations. You
must have the advanced alchemy ability to select this ability.
Extra Vial: Your familiar accretes alchemical liquids in
its body. Once per day, you can Interact when your familiar
is adjacent to you to gain a versatile vial. You must have the
versatile vials ability to select this ability.
Specific Familiars
Some familiars are more powerful than the usual familiars,
and possess unique abilities. Any character can gain a
specific familiar so long as they already have a familiar with
at least the required number of abilities listed in the specific
familiar’s stat block. Such a familiar usually replaces an
existing familiar, though in some circumstances (such as
for a witch) the familiar may evolve or reveal its true form.
In any case, this transition from a normal familiar to a
specific familiar requires no downtime and has no cost.
Once you’ve selected a specific familiar, you can’t change it
This section includes new options for familiar and master abilities, supplementing those
from pages 212–214 of Player Core, as well as stat blocks for familiars with unique abilities.

## Familiars

without losing your familiar—this uses the same rules for
gaining a new pet.
A specific familiar has several traits and abilities, as listed
in their stat block. The granted abilities entry lists normal
familiar and master abilities that familiar has. The familiar
also gains unique abilities listed below the granted abilities
entry. Much like a familiar that naturally has a familiar
ability (such as an owl with a fly Speed), you can never
swap out any of these granted or unique abilities. If your
familiar gains more abilities than the required number
of abilities, you can use the remaining abilities to select
additional familiar and master abilities as normal.
Statistics and abilities not listed in a specific familiar’s
stat block (such as modifiers, AC, Hit Points, and so forth)
use the normal familiar rules (Player Core 212).
Aeon Wyrd

a larger stone. It grants the power of its internal aeon stone
to its master.

it, and you gain the aeon stone’s resonant power. This doesn’t
interfere with any wayfinder you invest.
Can’t Walk Your aeon wyrd has no land Speed.
Crystalline Your aeon wyrd’s crystalline structure makes it
vulnerable to sonic attacks. It gains weakness to sonic equal
to your level.
Fey Dragonet
These tiny, mischievous dragons make natural allies for
benevolent or capricious characters.

## Fey Dragonet

save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. A
creature that fails its save is stupefied 2 and slowed 1 for 1d4
rounds; on a critical failure, the duration is 1 minute.

Homunculus
Homunculi are tiny servitor constructs created by a
crafter to serve as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. A
homunculus is crafted using a drop of its creator’s blood in
addition to any other components used in crafting its body.

## Homunculus

its creator using their shared blood as a conduit, allowing
it to share information back and forth at a range of 1,500
feet, including its master’s knowledge and everything the
homunculus hears. If you become unconscious and dying,
your homunculus senses the waning power in your blood,
allowing it to automatically act on the next turn as if you
Commanded it. If the homunculus is destroyed, the master
takes 2d10 mental damage.
Imp
Imp familiars pretend to be subservient in order to trick
their master into losing their soul or finding an early grave.

within 15 feet a bargain, granting a boon of good luck if the
creature accepts. The boon lasts for 1 hour once accepted. Once
during the hour, the creature can roll an attack roll or saving
throw twice and use the higher result. If the creature dies
while the boon is in place, the imp decides where the creature’s
soul travels. This typically makes the soul bound for eternity in
the imp’s home plane, and the creature is unable to be raised or
resurrected except by the wish ritual or similar magic.

that is about a foot long. Pipefoxes are secretive, shy,

rejuvenation ability, but it recovers 2 Hit Points per level
when you Refocus instead of 1.

171


## Spellslime


Beyond your class and general feats, you can expand your character concept by choosing an
archetype. Are you more heavily armored than your peers because of the sentinel archetype?
Are you a viking, experienced in seafaring and raiding? Perhaps you’re a medic, tending to
the fallen. These are just a few possibilities archetypes offer.

## Chapter 3:


## Archetypes

You gain an archetype by selecting archetype feats instead
of your normal feats. First, find the archetype that best
fits your character concept. Then select that archetype’s
dedication feat, using one of your class feat choices. Once
you’ve taken the dedication feat, you can select any feat
from that archetype, as long as you meet its prerequisites.
Most archetype feats are taken in place of class feats, and
so these are called archetype class feats.
An archetype feat is subject to any restrictions on the
class feat it replaces. For example, if you had an ability at
6th level that granted you a bonus class feat, but that class
feat had to be 4th level or lower and have the dwarf trait,
you could use that class feat to take an archetype class feat,
but only one of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait.
Dedication Details
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents your character’s
effort to learn a new set of abilities, making it impossible to
split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same
time. Once you take a dedication feat, you can’t select a
different dedication feat until you complete your dedication
by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You
can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other
feats from that archetype.
Multiclass Dedications
Some archetypes in this book have the multiclass trait.
These allow you to diversify your training into another
class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s
dedication feat if you are already a member of that class.
Additional Feats
Some archetypes include a list of “Additional Feats” that
appear in other sources. The list includes each feat’s level,
which might be different than normal when gained from
the archetype. You can take the feat as an archetype feat
of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of
feats required by the archetype’s dedication feat. When
selected this way, a feat that normally has a class’s trait
(such as the fighter trait) doesn’t have that class trait.
Feats that Grant Feats
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you select another feat,
such as a class feat of a lower level. You must always meet
any prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way. These
always count as only one feat for the purposes of your
dedication; for example, taking the barbarian archetype’s
Basic Fury feat to gain the Sudden Charge class feat
counts as only one feat, not two.
Spellcasting Archetypes
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of
spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character from
a spellcasting class. A spellcasting archetype allows you
to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a
member of a spellcasting class can.
Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast
cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic
spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master
spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the
archetype; for instance, the sorcerer archetype’s master
spellcasting feat is called Master Sorcerer Spellcasting.
All spell slots you gain from spellcasting archetypes
are subject to the restrictions within the archetype. For
instance, the eldritch archer archetype allows you to pick
a spell list when you take its dedication feat. If you pick
arcane spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots
you can use only to cast arcane spells from your eldritch
archer repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with arcane
spells in your sorcerer repertoire.
Basic Spellcasting Feat: Usually available at 4th level,
these feats grant a 1st-rank spell slot. At 6th level, they
grant you a 2nd-rank spell slot, and if you have a spell
repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire
as a signature spell. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd‑rank
spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the “basic
spellcasting benefits.”
Expert Spellcasting Feat: Typically taken at 12th level,
these feats make you an expert in spell attack modifier
and spell DC and grant you a 4th-rank spell slot. If you
have a spell repertoire, you can select a second spell from
your repertoire as a signature spell. At 14th level, they
grant you a 5th-rank spell slot, and at 16th level, they
grant you a 6th-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these
benefits as the “expert spellcasting benefits.”
Master Spellcasting Feat: Usually found at 18th level,
these feats make you a master in spell attack modifier
and spell DC and grant you a 7th-rank spell slot. If you
have a spell repertoire, you can select a third spell from
your repertoire as a signature spell. At 20th level, they

173

grant you an 8th-rank spell slot. Archetypes refer to these
benefits as the “master spellcasting benefits.”
Alchemical Archetypes
Some archetypes give you the ability to use alchemy in a
similar manner to an alchemist and say that you get the
advanced alchemy benefits or Quick Alchemy benefits.
Advanced Alchemy Benefits: You gain the Alchemical
Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t already have it.
In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows you to
create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables
each day during your daily preparations without the normal
cost or time expenditure, as described on page 58. If you
gain advanced alchemy from more than one source, use the
highest number of alchemical consumables per day rather
than adding them together, but you can make items of any
type allowed by any of your advanced alchemy abilities. For
instance, Herbalist Dedication lets you create 4 alchemical
consumables with the healing trait, and Poisoner Dedication
lets you create four alchemical poison consumables. If you
had both feats, you could create 4 total consumables, but
they could be any combination of healing and poison items.
Quick Alchemy Benefits: You gain the Alchemical
Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t already have it.
In addition, you gain the Quick Alchemy action (page 59),
which lets you create short-lived alchemical consumables
with a special action, and you can create a certain number of
versatile vials during your daily preparations to fuel Quick
Alchemy. Unless otherwise noted, you can’t regain versatile
vials throughout the day the way alchemists can. The
individual archetype tells you how many versatile vials you
can create each day, and might impose special restrictions or
benefits for how you can use them. If you gain versatile vials
from more than one source, you use the highest number of
vials to determine your maximum rather than adding them
together, but you can use the vials for any Quick Alchemy
option or other use of versatile vials you possess.
Temporary Items
Several archetypes allow you to prepare temporary items.
Much like the infused items created by alchemists, these
temporary items last only a short time before becoming
useless. Examples include temporary scrolls created by
the scroll trickster and temporary weapons, armor, or
adventuring gear created by the scrounger.
Temporary items are clearly not up to the same quality
as other items, so they typically can’t be sold. If an ability
doesn’t list how long a temporary item lasts, the item lasts
until the next time you make your daily preparations. Any
effect created by a temporary item also ends at that time if
it hasn’t already (unless it’s a permanent effect).
Special Archetypes
Some archetype feats have the skill trait, allowing you to
take them in place of a skill feat rather than a class feat.
A skill feat still counts to satisfy the requirement of the
dedication. Other books contain class archetypes that can
modify your class’s abilities as soon as 1st level. You can
never have more than one class archetype.

## Key Terms

You’ll see these terms within this chapter’s archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from spellshape feats. You must use the spellshape action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a
spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
spellshape action itself.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action,
whichever comes first. After you take an action with the
stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You
can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You
can Dismiss a stance.

Alchemist
You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and
substances in your spare time, and your studies have
progressed beyond mere experimentation. You might
throw bombs, drink mutagens, or carry an assortment
of helpful elixirs and alchemical tools.
Multiclass Alchemist Characters
The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype
are extremely useful to characters of any class. The
following are just some of the possible combinations.
- Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their
rage to ferocious effect.
- Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items
that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their
champion’s reaction and lay on hands to go further.
- Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain
additional options in situations where their usual
tactics don’t work.
- Ranger alchemists often focus on alchemy and
snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill
and supplying bombs for the bomb snare.
- Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison
feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an
interesting way to sneak attack with various types
of energy damage.
- Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical
items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared
spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew
up darkvision elixirs to grant vision in darkness can
prepare another spell instead of darkvision.

Multiclass Swashbuckler Characters

Archaeologist
Adventurers raid tombs for material gain, but true
archaeologists treasure the knowledge attained from
such sites. You might accomplish your goals with
scholarly learning, by training to overcome the tricks
and traps set by ancient peoples and rivals, through
magical training, or even with a bit of inexplicable luck.
Many archaeologists practice a combination of all these
approaches. Regardless of method, all archaeologists
possess a deep desire to learn more about sapient history
and prehistory. Adventuring through tombs, dodging
traps, and studying magic are all means to better
understand ancient sites, analyze artifacts, and decipher
the meaning of any remains that can be found from
previous inhabitants. You decide how you will uncover
the secrets of the past and what to do with the answers
you find.

once per day. You can cast this veil of privacy spell only on
an object, and it’s automatically heightened to half your level
rounded up.

Archer
Bows of all types are powerful weapons. Generals and
hunters alike recognize the power in dealing death from
a distance, and from behind safe cover. Those dedicated
to the bow—from mysterious cloaked strangers to
heartless snipers—are often viewed with a mixture of
respect and fear. Like any weapons adept, the archer’s
skill is forged through experience and constant practice.
A true archer becomes one with their bow and is able to
make incredible shots with their weapon that most would
consider impossible, or at the very least magical.
Additional Feats: 4th Assisting Shot (Player Core
141), Crossbow Ace (Player Core 157), Point Blank
Stance (Player Core 140); 6th Double Shot (Player
Core 143), Parting Shot (Player Core 143), Running
Reload (Player Core 159); 8th Triple Shot (Player Core
145); 10th Mobile Shot Stance (Player Core 146); 18th
Multishot Stance (Player Core 150); 20th Impossible
Volley (Player Core 150)

## Archer Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

You have familiarity with all weapons in the bow
and crossbow weapon groups. For the purposes of
proficiency, treat any of these that are martial weapons
as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as
martial weapons.
If you are at least an expert in the bow or crossbow you
are using, you get the critical specialization effect of that
weapon when you get a critical hit with it.
### Quick Shot [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Archer Dedication
You draw your bow and attack with the same action. You
Interact to draw a weapon from the bow or crossbow
weapon group that is loaded or has reload 0, then Strike with
that weapon.
### Crossbow Terror [one-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Archer Dedication
Your skill with a crossbow strikes terror into your opponents
when you threaten them with the next bolt. Interact to
reload a crossbow and then attempt an Intimidation check to
Demoralize. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check if
you succeeded at a Strike with a crossbow this turn.
ARCHER’S AIM [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Concentrate

Prerequisites Archer Dedication
You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. Make a ranged
Strike with a weapon in the bow or crossbow weapon group.

the target’s concealed condition. If the target is hidden, reduce
the flat check from being hidden from 11 to 5.
### Unobstructed Shot [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Archer Dedication, expert in Athletics
With a quick use of brute force, you remove an obstacle and
take a calculated shot as part of the same motion. Attempt to
Shove or Trip one adjacent creature, then make a ranged Strike
with a bow or crossbow you’re wielding. The Strike is made at
the same multiple attack penalty as the Shove or Trip attempt,
and this activity counts as one attack when calculating your
multiple attack penalty.

185

Assassin
Targeted killing through stealth and subterfuge is the
expertise of an assassin. While assassins are skilled in
ending lives and many are evil, some live by a moral
code, preying on the wicked, the cruel, or those who
revel in unchecked aggression or power.
Additional Feats: 4th Poison Resistance (Player
Core 129); 6th Poison Weapon (Player Core 171); 10th
Improved Poison Weapon (Player Core 173)

## Assassin Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Deception and Stealth
You’ve trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with
tenacity and precision. You gain the Mark for Death activity.
Mark for Death [three-actions] (concentrate) Requirements The creature
you intend to mark is observed by you; Effect You designate
a single creature as your mark. Using Mark for Death while
hidden or undetected doesn’t make you observed. Mark for
Death lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death
again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception
checks to Seek your mark, as well as to Deception checks to
Feint against your mark. Your mark takes a –2 circumstance
penalty to all Perception checks to Seek you.
In addition, when attacking your mark, you have the
sneak attack class feature (Player Core 167), except it deals
1d4 precision damage and you don’t increase the number of
dice as you gain levels. At 6th level, the damage increases
to 1d6. If you already have the sneak attack class feature,
you instead deal an additional 1 precision damage with your
sneak attacks made against your mark, increasing to 2
precision damage at 6th level.

## Expert Backstabber Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
You excel at quickly dispatching your foes.
When you Strike an off-guard foe with a
weapon that has the backstabber weapon trait,
you deal 2 extra precision damage instead of
1. If the weapon is a +3 weapon, you deal 4
extra precision damage instead of 2.

## Surprise Attack Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
You act before foes can react. On the first round of
combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative,
creatures that haven’t acted are off-guard to you.
### Angel Of Death  FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
All your Strikes against a creature you have Marked for Death
have the death trait, causing the mark to be instantly killed
when reduced to 0 Hit Points. In addition, if the creature is
killed this way, attempts to communicate with it, return it to
life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail
unless the effect’s counteract rank is higher than half your
level rounded up, or originates from an artifact or a deity.
Use the level you were when you killed the creature, even
if your level is higher at the time the attempt was made.
### Assassinate [two-actions] FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Assassin Dedication
Requirements You have designated a mark using Mark for
Death and are completely unnoticed by your mark.
You strike with one swift movement, trying to instantly slay
your mark. Make a Strike against your mark. If you hit, your
mark takes an additional 6d6 precision damage with a basic
Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell
DC. If the mark critically fails, it dies unless its level is higher
than yours. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is
temporarily immune to your Assassinate for 1 day.

Bastion
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but
you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In
your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield
between you and your enemies. You’ve focused your
training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself
and those around you. Darting around in search of
cover isn’t necessary when you carry your cover with
you. With a shield in your hand, you are akin to a
mobile fortress. You repel assaults and stand strong
against the tide of enemies, secure in the knowledge
that you have your most trusted companion at your
side: your shield. This long-lasting fighting style has
existed for ages due to its practicality and propensity
for survival among its practitioners. While some prefer
the nimbleness of a free hand or the power of a larger
weapon, a bastion knows that surviving a little bit
longer is worth more than a quicker or stronger attack.
Additional Feats: 6th Shielded Stride (Player Core
143); 8th Reflexive Shield (Player Core 145), Shield
Warden (page 96); 10th Quick Shield Block (page 97);
12th Mirror Shield (Player Core 148); 18th Improved
Reflexive Shield (Player Core 150)

## Bastion Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites Shield Block
You are particularly skilled at using a shield to protect yourself
in combat. You gain the Reactive Shield fighter feat (Player
Core 140).
### Disarming Block [free-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication, trained in Athletics
Trigger You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a
held weapon.
With deft and practiced movement, you block at an angle to
potentially dislodge the weapon. You attempt to Disarm the
creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they
attacked you with. You can do so even if you don’t have
a hand free.
### Nimble Shield Hand  FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even
while using the hand that’s holding it for other tasks that
require the dexterity of a hand. The hand you use to wield a
shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the Interact
action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you
still can’t use it to wield a weapon). This benefit doesn’t apply
to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.

## Destructive Block Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense
of your shield. When you Shield Block, you can reduce the
damage to yourself by double the shield’s Hardness, but if you
do, the shield takes double the normal amount of damage it
would have taken (before applying its Hardness). You can’t use
Destructive Block if your shield can’t typically be broken or
destroyed, such as if you’re using an indestructible shield.

## Shield Salvation Feat 12


## Archetype

Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can save your shield from total destruction, even after
a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to
damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains
intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened until
you take the time to repair it thoroughly, preventing you from
using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next
preparations.

187

Beastmaster
You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers
increase, you can command more of them, briefly
inhabit their body to perceive what they perceive, and
even communicate with them over vast distances.
Additional Feats: 4th Animal Empathy (Player Core
158), Initiate Warden (heal companion and magic hide
only, Player Core 157); 6th Advanced Warden (enlarge
companion only, Player Core 159), Companion’s Cry
(Player Core 159); 14th Side by Side (Player Core
162). Warden spells granted by any of these feats are
beastmaster focus spells for you.

## Beastmaster Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Nature
You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels
with you and obeys your commands. The rules for animal
companions appear on page 206 of Player Core. Contrary to
the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you
a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one
animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See
the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on
this action.
Certain beastmaster feats give you focus spells. The rules
for focus spells appear on page 298 of Player Core. When
you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become
trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics.
Your key spellcasting attribute for beastmaster archetype
spells is Charisma, and they are primal spells. You can
Refocus by feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an
animal companion.

## Additional Companion Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal
companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster
Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal
companions works.
Special You can select this feat more than once, gaining an
additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of
four total companions from all sources.
### Mature Beastmaster Companion  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature
animal companions and gaining additional capabilities (Player
Core 211).
Your animal companion has greater independence. During
an encounter, even if you don’t use the Command an Animal
action, your active animal companion can still use 1 action that
round on your turn to Stride or Strike. It can do this at any
point during your turn, as long as you aren’t currently taking
an action. If it does, that’s all the actions it gets that round—
you can’t Command it later.

## Beastmaster’S Trance Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
You can enter a trance that allows you to briefly inhabit
the body of one of your animal companions and share its
senses. You gain the focus spell beastmaster trance.
### Swift Guardian [free-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype Concentrate

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion
Trigger You roll initiative.

When danger appears, you quickly send away your active
companion and call in a different animal ally. You use Call
Companion. The new animal companion typically arrives in the
same location as the one that departed, though the GM might
adjust this depending on the circumstances and Speeds of the
animals. If you have Lead the Pack, you can swap one of your
two active companions for an inactive companion.
### Incredible Beastmaster Companion  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Mature Beastmaster Companion
Your mature animal companions continue to grow and develop.
Each of them becomes a nimble or savage animal companion,
gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of
companion (Player Core 211). You choose nimble or savage
individually for each companion, including any companion
that becomes mature after you take this feat.

## Beastmaster Bond Feat 10


## Archetype Mental Primal

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
You can communicate telepathically with your animal
companions within 100 feet. If you’re legendary in Nature, you
can communicate telepathically with your animal companions
anywhere on the planet.
BEASTMASTER’S CALL [one-action] FEAT 12

## Archetype Auditory Concentrate Primal

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion
Frequency once per turn
You quickly call in a primal projection of a non-active companion
to provide the companion’s support benefit. The projection
arrives in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet
of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears at
the start of your next turn. The projection has the same AC and
saving throw modifiers as the real companion, and if it would
take any damage before your next turn, it disappears, and the
support benefit ends immediately.
### Specialized Beastmaster Companion  FEAT 14

## Archetype

Prerequisites Incredible Beastmaster Companion
Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning
enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one
specialization of your choice (Player Core 211). Choose the
specialization separately for each companion, including any
companion that becomes specialized after you take this feat.
Special You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add
a different specialization to each of your nimble and savage
companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have
up to three specializations each.
### Lead The Pack  FEAT 16

## Uncommon Archetype

Prerequisites Mature Beastmaster Companion, you have
multiple animal companions
You can have up to two animal companions active at once.
However, when you do, it’s slightly more difficult to Command
them. If you don’t Command either of your companions, one
of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn
to Stride or Strike, per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but
not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose one
of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else each
companion can take 1 action to Stride or Strike. Either way,
you can’t Command an Animal to make either companion act
again until your next turn.
Beastmaster Focus Spells
BEASTMASTER TRANCE [three-actions] FOCUS 3
### Uncommon Archetype Concentrate Focus Manipulate Mental
Range 1 mile; Targets one animal companion you can perceive
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You enter a trance that allows you to see through the senses
of the target companion. You attempt Perception checks using
your own Perception, but you share special senses the target
has, such as low-light vision. This spell grants no special
method of communication with the chosen animal.
For the duration of the trance, your own senses are muted.
This lack of awareness makes you off-guard. You can’t take
actions with the attack or move traits.
Heightened (6th) Increase the range to 100 miles and the
duration of sustained up to 10 minutes. The target can hear
you through the spell, allowing you to Command the Animal
or use other actions that have the auditory trait.
Heightened (8th) Increase the range to planetary and the
duration of sustained up to 1 hour. You can communicate
telepathically with the target for the duration of the trance.
Beastmaster Animal Companions
If you’re playing a beastmaster, you determine the
statistics and abilities of your animal companions
according to the rules on pages 206–211 of Player Core.
As a beastmaster, it’s possible for you to have more
than one animal companion at one time—up to four
companions—but only one of those companions, your
“active companion,” follows you during exploration and
in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or
hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal
companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also
gain Call Companion to switch your active companion.
These rules apply to all your companions, regardless
of whether you got the animal companion from the
beastmaster archetype or from another source.

## Call Companion


## Exploration

You spend 1 minute calling for a different animal
companion, switching your active companion for another
of your animal companions.

189

Blessed One
Through luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry
the blessing of a deity. This blessing manifests as the
ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions,
and exists independent of any worship. You might
offer gratitude daily to the deity whose power you
wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly,
seeking to avoid responsibility or even openly acting
to defy the deity’s influence on you. You might wear
the robes of the deity’s order, or you might give little
thought and even less reverence to the source of your
powers. However you feel about these potent gifts,
there can be no doubt that you wield a special power.
Benevolent deities are most likely to empower a blessed
one. However, any deity can grant such a blessing, as
long as they’re capable of granting a healing divine font
to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu
might grant the blessed one’s powers for their own
purposes. Despite this possibility, it’s quite uncommon
for deities of cruelty, death, and destruction to grant
the power of rejuvenation. When this does occur, the
deity usually has a malicious intent behind the gift.
Ultimately, you decide how you will use this gift. Will
you aid the deity who granted you this power, or will
you work in defiance of them?
Additional Feats: 6th Mercy (page 95); 10th Greater
Mercy (page 97); 14th Affliction Mercy (page 97); 20th
Rejuvenating Touch (page 99), Ultimate Mercy (page
99)
### Blessed One Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to
alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the lay on hands
devotion spell (page 256). The rules for focus spells appear
on page 298 of Player Core. You can Refocus by meditating,
whether you reflect on the deity granting the blessing or
not, allowing your blessing to refill your focus pool. Your
devotion spells from the blessed one archetype are divine
spells. You become trained in spell attack modifier and spell
DC. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.

## Blessed Sacrifice Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication
You gain the protector’s sacrifice domain spell as a devotion
spell (Player Core page 378).
### Blessed Spell [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype Concentrate Spellshape

Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication, ability to cast spells
from spell slots, Mercy
Frequency once per 10 minutes
When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove
harmful conditions. If your next action is to Cast a Spell
from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally,
you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from
that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed
by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats
such as Greater Mercy. Attempt a counteract check based
on the spell’s DC and rank. This effect is in addition to the
normal effects of your spell.
### Blessed Denial [reaction] FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication
Trigger An ally within 30 feet would become frightened,
drained, enfeebled, sickened, or stupefied.
You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful
condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the
condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the
ally has more than one eligible condition at the same time,
choose one to reduce.

Bounty Hunter
Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to
track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You’re
accustomed to perusing wanted posters, following up
on leads, and pursuing your quarry to hell and back.
Once you locate your prey’s trail, you’re unshakable.
Additionally, you have the skills and experience to subdue
even the most troublesome mark and bring them in to
secure your reward.
Additional Feats: 4th Monster Hunter (Player Core
157); 14th Double Prey (Player Core 162)
### Bounty Hunter Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Survival
When focused on finding your quarry, you’re relentless. You
gain the Hunt Prey action (Player Core 154). You can use Hunt
Prey to designate a creature that you’ve observed, heard
about, or learned about through some other means, such as
a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other
benefits of Hunt Prey, you can designate a target as your
prey while Gathering Information about them, in addition to
designating them as your prey when Tracking them as normal.
If you have already identified your target and selected them
as your prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to
Gather Information about them.
If you already have Hunt Prey, you gain the Monster Hunter
feat in addition to the other benefits of this feat.

## Posse Feat 4


## Archetype Exploration

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
Requirements You have designated prey with Hunt Prey.
By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your
prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you.
They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Seek your prey, to Track
your prey, and to Gather Information about your prey. You and
the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.
These benefits lasts until you designate a new prey or
your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature
assisting you loses this benefit if they’re out of your presence
for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1
hour, but is determined by the GM.
### Tools Of The Trade  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
You’re well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties
back in one piece, or at least alive. You have familiarity with the
bola, sap, and whip; for the purposes of proficiency, you treat
these weapons as simple weapons. You deal an additional 1d4
precision damage with these weapons when using them to make
nonlethal Strikes against your prey while they’re off‑guard to you.
In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal
attack with a weapon without the nonlethal trait.
### Keep Pace [reaction] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
Trigger Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away
from you.
Once you are upon your prey, they can’t escape. Stride up to
your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout
its movement until it stops moving or you’ve moved your full
Speed. You can use Keep Pace to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim
instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
### Opportunistic Grapple [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Bounty Hunter Dedication
Trigger Your prey critically fails on an attack roll against you
with a melee Strike.
Requirements Your prey is within your reach, you have one free
hand, and your target is no more than one size larger than you.
You use an opening to capture your prey. You attempt an Athletics
check to Grapple your prey.

191

Cavalier
You are a skilled and dedicated warrior on the battlefield
who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal
companion that serves as your mount. You and your
mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared
intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might
wield a banner in the name of an order of which you’re
a member, a liege to whom you’ve sworn your service,
or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to
further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers.
Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop
majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of
animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to
dinosaurs. What’s important is not the type of mount but
the connection between the cavalier and their companion.
This bond is their true strength.

## Cavalier Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Nature or Society
You gain a young animal companion (Player Core 206) that
serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions
with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options
from your pledge (see Cavalier Pledges sidebar, page 193), as
determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion
that’s at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually
starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that
animal (changing no statistics other than its size).
Special If you have pledged yourself to a cause, you can take a
second dedication feat closely tied to that cause even if you
haven’t taken two additional cavalier feats. For instance,
if you pledged yourself to fight crime with a group of
vigilantes, you could take the vigilante dedication without
first completing the cavalier archetype. The GM determines
what archetypes, if any, are valid choices.

## Cavalier’S Banner Feat 4

### Uncommon Archetype Aura Emotion Mental Visual
Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You have pledged your service to a specific
organization or ideal (see Cavalier Pledges sidebar, page 193).
You fly the banner of your pledge from your mount, raising
your allies’ spirits. You and all allies in a 30-foot emanation
from your mount gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves
and DCs against fear effects. If your banner is destroyed or
removed, allies within 30 feet become frightened 1.
CAVALIER’S CHARGE [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You are riding your mount.
You Command an Animal to order your mount to Stride
twice. At any point during this movement, you can Strike
one enemy within reach or within the first range increment
of a ranged weapon. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
your attack roll.

## Impressive Mount Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
You’ve trained your mount to become a
powerful force on the battlefield. The mount
you gained through the Cavalier Dedication
feat becomes a mature animal companion,
granting it additional capabilities.
Your mount has greater independence.
During an encounter, even if you don’t use
the Command an Animal action, your mount
can still use 1 action that round on your turn to
Stride or Strike. It can do this at any point during
your turn, as long as you aren’t currently taking
an action. If it does, that’s all the actions it gets
that round—you can’t Command it later.

### Quick Mount [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication, expert in Nature
Requirements You are adjacent to a creature that is at least
one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.
You and your mount can spring into action at a moment’s
notice. You Mount the creature and Command an Animal to
issue it an order of your choice.
### Defend Mount [reaction] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Trigger An enemy makes a Strike or spell attack against your
mount while you’re riding it.
You interpose yourself between an attacker and your mount,
defending your mount from harm. Use your own defense
against the triggering attack instead your mount’s defense. If
the triggering attack hits, you take the effects of the attack
instead of your mount.

## Mounted Shield Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
You’ve trained with your shield to defend both yourself and
your mount. When you Raise a Shield while mounted, both
you and your mount gain the shield’s circumstance bonus to
AC. If you have the Shield Block reaction, you can use it when
your mount would take physical damage, as long as you’re
riding your mount. If you do, the shield prevents your mount
from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking
damage, following the normal rules for Shield Block.

## Incredible Mount Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Impressive Mount
Under your care and training, your mount has realized its
innate potential. The mount you gained through the Cavalier
Dedication feat becomes a nimble or savage animal companion
(your choice), gaining additional capabilities determined by
the type of companion.
### Trampling Charge [three-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You are riding a mount that has a melee Strike
using its legs (claw, talons, hoof, etc.).
You urge your mount to charge into the fray, trampling all
enemies who stand in your path. You command your mount
to Stride up to double its Speed (or to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or
Swim, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving
through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size
smaller than your mount. Your mount deals the damage of
one of its melee Strikes to each creature whose space you
move through, with a basic Reflex save against your mount’s
Athletics DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes
off-guard until the end of your next turn. Roll the damage only
once. You can damage a given creature only once during this
movement.
### Unseat [one-action] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
Requirements You are riding your mount and wielding a
jousting weapon.
With a mighty blow from atop your companion, you attempt
to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee Strike
against a mounted creature. If your attack hits, attempt
an Athletics check against the target’s Fortitude DC. If you
succeed, the target is knocked off its mount into a space of
its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, the
target also lands prone.

## Specialized Mount Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Incredible Mount
You’ve trained your mount to perform in unusual or even
extreme circumstances, granting it abilities far beyond others
of its kind. Your mount gains one specialization of your choice.
Special You can select this feat up to three times. Each time,
add a different specialization to your mount. Your mount
can’t have more than three specializations.

## Legendary Rider Feat 20


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication
You and your mount move like one being, effortlessly reading
each other’s signals and synchronizing even in the thick of
battle. Whenever you’re riding your mount, you are quickened;
you can use the extra action only to command your mount
using the Command an Animal skill action.

## Cavalier Pledges

Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific
organization or individual, such as a noble family or
sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization,
or particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal
must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it
has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid’s animal
order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier
pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the
same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge
yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema,
you should work with your GM to determine the edicts
and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers
who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain
abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier’s Banner.
If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose
access to those feats until you benefit from an atone
ritual (Player Core 390). Changing the subject of your
pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature.

193

Celebrity
You’re a special personality... and you know it. You’re not
merely comfortable in the spotlight, you crave it. While
the traditional celebrity is a musician or another type
of performer, you could be known for any occupation.
You know how to use your position to command the
attention of others or steal it away from those around
you. While you’re in a room all eyes are on you, and you
love it. Your life is a show, and you are here to steal the
love and admiration of everyone watching.

## Celebrity Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

The more people you have looking at you, the more content
you are, and you take every opportunity to show up others
when their performances are less than perfect. You gain
the Upstage reaction. In addition, when you Earn Income, if
the level of the task is higher than your level, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your check to Earn Income.
Upstage [reaction] Trigger An enemy attempts a skill check and
doesn’t get a critical success; Effect After your foe has tried
their best, you show everyone how it’s really done. Attempt
a check using the same skill that triggered this reaction. The
DC is typically the same as the check the enemy attempted,
though the GM can adjust this as usual.
Critical Success You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls,
Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks until
the end of your next turn.
Success As critical success, except you gain the benefits
only if the triggering creature failed their skill check.
### Never Tire [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication
Trigger You would gain the fatigued condition.
Requirements You are observed by at least three creatures
who aren’t enemies.
As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform
even when you are on the brink of collapse. Indeed, you must—
you have an obligation to your fans! You delay the effects of
the fatigued condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer
observed by at least three creatures who aren’t enemies,
whichever comes first. If the fatigued condition has a duration,
the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can’t
further delay or prevent the fatigued condition after this
ability ends.
### Mesmerizing Gaze [two-actions] FEAT 6
### Archetype Concentrate Emotion Mental Visual
Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication
When you meet someone’s gaze, they’re unable to look away
from you. Choose one target creature you can see and that
can see you. That creature must succeed at a Will save or
be fascinated with you until the end of your next turn; the
DC is the higher of your class DC or spell DC. If the creature
succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a hostile
action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing
Gaze for 1 day.
### Command Attention [one-action] FEAT 10
### Archetype Auditory Aura Concentrate Emotion Mental Visual
Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication
You command the attention of all around you with style,
ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of
your next turn. Whenever a creature in a 30-foot emanation
around you attempts a saving throw against a different
visual effect, it gets a result one degree of success better
than it rolled. This is a fortune effect.
When an enemy within the aura attempts to use a visual
effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular
creature (such as a medusa’s Focus Gaze), it must succeed at
a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is
higher, in order to target any creature except you.
Allies in the aura can attempt to Hide even if they don’t
have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction.

Dandy
You are a genteel master of style, culture, and decorum,
aware of even the subtlest rules of etiquette.

## Dandy Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You are a consummate student of dignity, etiquette, and
fashion. You become trained in Deception and Society; if you
were already trained in either, you become an expert in it
instead. You gain the Influence Rumor downtime activity.
Influence Rumor (downtime) You spend at least 1 day of
downtime attempting to manipulate the course, tone, or
content of a rumor to your benefit. You need to succeed
at a Diplomacy check to shift the rumor as you intend. The
difficulty is determined by the GM based on the size of the
community, the relative perceptiveness of the inhabitants,
and the agency of other rumormongers, but it typically is no
lower than DC 15 for a small village, DC 20 for a town, DC
30 for a city, or DC 40 for a metropolis.
### Distracting Flattery [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, expert in Deception
Trigger You observe a target’s attitude toward yourself or your
allies decrease as a result of an ally’s behavior.
You know how to maintain a good impression and manage
your image, even while keeping uncouth company. Make
a Deception check against the target’s Will DC. Regardless
of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your
Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes.
Success The target’s attitude doesn’t decrease as a result of
your ally’s social blunder.
Failure The target’s attitude decreases as normal.
Critical Failure Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing
the target’s attitude toward you by one step, in addition to
any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction.

## Gossip Lore Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication
Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed
on every topic. You are trained in Gossip Lore, a special Lore
skill that can be used only to Recall Knowledge, but on any
topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip Lore,
you get the effects of the Dubious Knowledge skill feat (Player
Core 254).
If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain
expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can’t increase your
proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.

## Fabricated Connections Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in Deception
You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that
you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully
completed it. You can roll Deception in place of a different
skill when attempting to Earn Income, Make an Impression,
Request, or Subsist. You can use Fabricated Connections to
Make an Impression or Request once per day, and you can also
use it once per week to Earn Income or Subsist.

## Party Crasher Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in Society
You attend all the fashionable society parties, no matter how
exclusive they might be. Any time you encounter a social event
you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation,
royal gala, or other society function, you can spend 1d4 hours
to secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find
invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary
jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way,
or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies. This
ability doesn’t apply to secret events or other small private
gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved.

195

Dual-Weapon Warrior
You’re able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons
simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a
storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best
form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to
avoid your whirlwind of weapons. Your unconventional
fighting style still manages to weave in a unique kind of
defense, blocking blade with blade, all without sacrificing
power. Speed is your friend, and stagnation can mean
ruin. Your attacks come fast and from unexpected angles.
Become one with the blur of weapons and find victory.
Additional Feats: 4th Quick Draw (Player Core 159);
6th Twin Parry (Player Core 144); 12th Twin Riposte
(Player Core 148); 16th Improved Twin Riposte (Player
Core 150), Two-Weapon Flurry (Player Core 150); 18th
Twinned Defense (Player Core 150)
### Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You’re exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the
Double Slice fighter feat (Player Core 140).

## Dual Thrower Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with
them. Whenever a feat you gained from the dual-weapon
warrior archetype allows you to make a melee Strike, you
can instead make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon or
a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding (weapons that
need “1+” hand, such as longbows, don’t qualify). Any effects
from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or
melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and
ranged Strikes.
### Dual-Weapon Reload [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to
reload while holding two weapons. While you’re wielding
two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, you don’t
need a free hand to reload a one-handed ranged weapon
you’re wielding.
### Flensing Slice [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements Your last action was a Double Slice, and both
attacks hit the target.
When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense
the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The
target takes 1d8 persistent bleed damage per weapon damage
die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most
weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a major striking
weapon). In addition, until the start of your next turn the
target is off-guard, and its resistances to any physical damage
types are reduced by 5.
### Dual-Weapon Blitz [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements You are wielding two onehanded
melee weapons, each in a different
hand.
You attack as you weave your way around the
battlefield. Stride up to your Speed. During this
movement, you can Strike once with each of the
two one-handed melee weapons. Each of these
Strikes can be made at any point during your
movement.

## Dual Onslaught Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Dedication
When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for
the target to escape your attack. When you use Double Slice,
if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons
and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can’t
choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a
critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack
rolls were critical failures.

Duelist
All across the world, students in fencing academies
practice with their weapons to master one-on-one
combat. The libraries of these schools contain troves of
information, detailing hundreds of combat techniques,
battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement.
Those who gain admission to such training classes
might duel in formalized settings—and that’s certainly
the more genteel route to take. However, others assert
that there’s no better training ground for duels than
the chaotic life of an adventurer. In such situations, a
flexible, single‑handed fighting style is invaluable. You
never know when you’ll need an extra hand to shove
a foe, haul open a door, or grab valuable loot. You can
accomplish such deeds with style and grace. Regardless
of your method, fighters such as you are feared across
the land.
Additional Feats: 4th Dueling Parry (Player Core
141); 8th Disarming Stance (Player Core 145); 10th
Dueling Riposte (Player Core 146); 12th Disarming
Twist (Player Core 147); 14th Dueling Dance (Player
Core 149), Improved Dueling Riposte (Player Core
149); 16th Guiding Riposte (Player Core 150)

## Duelist Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in light armor and simple weapons
You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel,
no matter the circumstances. You gain the Quick Draw feat
(Player Core 159), enabling you to both draw and attack with
a weapon as 1 action.
DUELIST’S CHALLENGE [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Duelist Dedication
Select one enemy you can see and proclaim a challenge
against it. That enemy is your dueling opponent until it’s
defeated, it flees from the encounter, or the encounter ends.
Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed
melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you
gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike’s damage equal to
the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent,
you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the
number of damage dice your weapon deals.

## Selfless Parry Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Duelist Dedication, Dueling Parry
You protect those near to you with a flash of steel
and a stroke of good luck. When you’re benefiting
from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have Dueling
Riposte, you can use it when an enemy within your
reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you,
not just against yourself.
### Student Of The Dueling Arts  FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Duelist Dedication
Dueling is your art, and your weapon is your instrument.
You have studied and evaluated a great many combat
techniques, which you can review each day without fail to
ensure you are prepared for any and every situation that
may occur. During your daily preparations, you can swap
out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other
duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which
you are qualified. You can’t swap out Duelist Dedication or
Student of the Dueling Arts in this way.
In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist
archetype feat you don’t have (such as one listed under
Additional Feats) by increasing the number of actions it
takes to enter the stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You
must still meet the stance feat’s prerequisites.

197

Eldritch Archer
While many archers see their craft as an art form as
much as a means of battle, a small number of archers
seek to perfect their skills through magic, and you
are among their number. Bolstering your athletic and
martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare
heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming arrows
or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending projectiles
zig‑zagging unerringly to their targets, and manifesting
arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. The
imbuing of raw magic into the point of an arrow is no
easy feat. Eldritch archers are respected and feared for
their prowess and make valuable members for any party
of adventurers.
While having some spellcasting ability increases
your flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you
might learn the secrets of these arts without being
independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the
magic of the bow for its own sake. In fact, many eldritch
archers begin as archers first and spellcasters second.
That is not to say that the occasional spellcaster has not
picked up archery. In fact, many wizards, wise in the art
of war, have studied the bow, particularly to master this
art. Ultimately, what matters is a perfect combination of
martial skill and magical ability; the order you go about
obtaining them matters little.
Additional Feats: 8th Running Reload (Player Core
159); 20th Impossible Volley (Player Core 150)
### Eldritch Archer Dedication  FEAT 6

## Archetype Dedication Magical

Prerequisites expert in at least one weapon from the
bow or crossbow weapon group
You channel powerful magic with your archery,
allowing you to deliver potent spells through
the tip of an arrow rather than the more
mundane flick of the wrist or whatever
other gestures are usually used. If you
don’t already cast spells from spell
slots, you learn to cast spontaneous
spells and gain the Cast a Spell
activity. You gain a spell repertoire
with one cantrip of your choice, from
a tradition of your choice. You choose a
common cantrip or other cantrip to which
you have access. This cantrip must require
a spell attack roll and come from your chosen
tradition. You’re trained in spell attack modifier
and spell DC. Your key spellcasting attribute for
these spells is Charisma.
Regardless of whether you can already cast spells
or gained the ability from this dedication, you gain
the Eldritch Shot activity.
Eldritch Shot [three-actions] Requirements You are
wielding a bow or a loaded crossbow; Effect
You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast
and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the
spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into
the bow you’re wielding. Make a Strike with that
bow. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using
your attack roll result to determine the effects
of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as
two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but
you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve
completed the Eldritch Shot.
### Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication

You gain the basic spellcasting benefits (page 173). Each time
you gain a spell slot of a new level from this archetype, add a
spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire, either a
common spell of your chosen tradition or another spell of that
tradition you have learned or discovered.
### Enchanting Shot [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Emotion Magical Mental

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your
ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.
Make a bow or crossbow Strike. On a hit, the target takes an
additional 2d6 mental damage. On a critical hit, the target
also becomes stunned 1. The mental damage increases to 3d6
if your weapon has a greater striking rune, or to 4d6 if your
weapon has a major striking rune.

## Magic Ammunition Feat 8


## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
You imbue your ammunition with raw and potent magic,
transforming it to suit your needs in any situation. When
you select this feat, choose three types of common magical
ammunition of 4th level or lower from GM Core (pages 255-
256) or this book (pages 301-302). Your GM might allow
you to choose from other types of magical ammunition
of an appropriate level, such as uncommon ammunition,
or ammunition from other books. You gain the Transform
Ammunition action.
Transform Ammunition [free-action] (magical) Frequency once per
round; Effect You transform a non-magical arrow or bolt
on your person into a piece of magical ammunition of one
type you chose for the Magic Ammunition feat. You must
shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the
magic dissipates. If the ammunition has an Activate entry,
you still need to spend the required actions to activate the
ammunition before shooting it. You can choose a type of
magical ammunition that is typically not available to the
type of ammunition you’re using—for example, you can
use climbing bolt on an arrow, even though that magical
ammunition is normally only found on bolts.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you
do, select three additional types of magical ammunition as
described above.
### Precious Ammunition [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
You have learned to mimic the power that lies between
magic and material. You enchant a piece of ammunition on
your person with the magical essence of a precious material,
allowing you to leverage certain creatures’ weaknesses.
Choose cold iron or silver; if you shoot the arrow or bolt
before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At
14th level, add adamantine to the list of materials you can
choose from.
### Eldritch Reload [free-action] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Requirements Your last action this turn was to make an
Eldritch Shot, Cast a Spell from a spell slot, or activate a
piece of magical ammunition.
You integrate your talent for magic into your use of reloading
weapons. You Interact to reload a weapon you are wielding.
### Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting  FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting
You learn additional eldritch archer magic. You gain the expert
spellcasting benefits (page 173).
### Homing Shot [one-action] FEAT 14

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles
to reach your target. Make a bow or crossbow Strike against
a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target,
even going around corners. You ignore the target’s concealed
condition and all cover.
### Incorporeal Shot [one-action] FEAT 16

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create
a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but
your target. Make a bow or crossbow Strike against a foe
who is observed or hidden to you (but not undetected). The
ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing
through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though
magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the
concealed condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance
bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit
creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike’s damage
can’t be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a nonmagical
shield.
### Fatal Shot [three-actions] FEAT 18

## Archetype Magical

Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a
single potent hit. Make a bow or crossbow Strike. On a hit, you
deal an additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the
target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against
the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be immediately slain;
this save has the death and incapacitation traits.
### Master Eldritch Archer Spellcasting  FEAT 18

## Archetype

Prerequisites Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting
You gain the master spellcasting benefits (page 173).

199

Familiar Master
From the wise owl perched on the wizard’s shoulder to
the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own
reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist’s lab
to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief’s
cell, familiars have always served. Yours serves better
than most. This is often due to an unusually strong
connection or rigorous intentional training. Regardless
of the method, the extraordinary qualities of your
familiar are undeniable.
You and your familiar are a team in and of
yourselves. In a tough situation, you know you have
each other’s back, and you are nigh inseparable. Some
familiar masters, however, choose to keep familiars for
only a short period. They will keep their ally for a time,
then release them and forge a new bond. They form
strong connections quickly and attract new familiars
everywhere they go. This behavior is less common
but is often done out of a high level of respect for the
independence of both the adventurer and the familiar,
or a strong connection to the ebb and flow of life and
the cycle of change that touches all things. You are
among these masters and can decide which practice
best suits you.
Additional Feats: 4th Enhanced Familiar (page 153)
### Familiar Master Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might
have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as
meditating under the moon until something crept out of the
forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as
rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued
in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the
end. You gain a familiar (Player Core 212). If you already have a
familiar, you gain the Enhanced Familiar feat (page 153).

## Familiar Mascot Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication
When selecting master abilities, you can choose an ally to
benefit from any specific master ability. Each master ability
can benefit only a single character, and you can select a specific
master ability only once unless the ability says otherwise.
### Familiar Conduit [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Concentrate Spellshape

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication, able to cast spells
Requirements You have line of effect to your familiar.
Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the
hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for
your magic. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that
has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.

## Improved Familiar Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication
You find it easy to attract a powerful and unusual familiar
to your side. The number of abilities required to make your
familiar a specific familiar (page 170) is two lower than normal.

## Mutable Familiar Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication
Your familiar’s supernatural spirit has outgrown its corporeal
body. You can conduct a special 10-minute exploration
activity to reselect certain familiar abilities, switching one or
more of the following abilities for other abilities on this list:
amphibious, burrower, climber, darkvision, fast movement,
manual dexterity, resistance, and scent. You can reselect only
familiar abilities you would normally be able to reselect each
day, not required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can’t
remove an ability that is required for another ability your
familiar has (for instance, you can’t remove manual dexterity if
the familiar has item delivery).

## Incredible Familiar Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Enhanced Familiar
Your familiar is infused with even more magic than other
familiars. You can select six familiar or master abilities each
day, instead of four.

Gladiator
The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat
drive you to become the best—and the fame isn’t bad
either. You always do your best work under the fervent
gaze of spectators, and by work, you of course mean
violence.

## Gladiator Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites Impressive Performance
You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment.
You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Gladiatorial
Lore. If you were already trained in Gladiatorial Lore, you also
become trained in a Lore skill of your choice.
At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators,
you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character
level for 1 minute and you can roll Performance for
your initiative. If there are sapient creatures observing
a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither
engaged in the combat themselves nor directly assisting
any participants, the combatants have spectators. The
GM is the final arbiter of whether or not a combat has
spectators.

## Fancy Moves Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication, expert in
Performance
You show off your fighting style to discourage your foes.
You can use Performance to Demoralize.
### Play To The Crowd [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype Concentrate

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication
Trigger You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a combat
encounter with spectators.
You show off for the crowd. Attempt a Performance check;
the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard
DC for your level or the DC to Make an Impression on the
spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of
the following benefits to gain; on a critical success, choose
two benefits:
- A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your
character level. These last for 1 minute.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your
next turn.
- A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before
the end of your next turn.

## Stage Fighting Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication
You pull punches to give a better show. You don’t take the
usual –2 circumstance penalty when making a nonlethal
attack with a weapon or unarmed attack that doesn’t have the
nonlethal trait.
### Performative Weapons Training  FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Gladiator Dedication
You’re skilled with flashy weapons and can use them to great
effect. You have familiarity with the bo staff, dueling cape
(Player Core 288), spiked chain, sword cane, trident, war flail,
and whip. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat these
as simple weapons. The GM may add other martial weapons
to this list as appropriate for the world or region you are
playing in.
Whenever you get a critical hit with one of these weapons,
you get its critical specialization effect.
### Call Your Shot  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Play to the Crowd
When you successfully Play to the Crowd, add the
following to the list of benefits you can choose from:
- A creature you can see within 30
feet becomes frightened 2. This
effect has the emotion, fear, mental,
and visual traits.

201

Herbalist
The plants around you can provide more remedies than
the finest hospital or temple, and you are skilled in
their use. Nature always provides to those who know
how to look, and you have always had a talent for
seeing these gifts before you. You can put it to good
use, healing those around you with nothing more than
what the world provides.

## Herbalist Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Nature, Natural Medicine
You can create natural remedies. You gain the advanced
alchemy benefits (page 174). You can use advanced alchemy
to create 4 alchemical consumables with the healing trait,
though the number is reduced by 2 if you didn’t make your
daily preparations in the wilderness. These consumables are
called your herbal items. You remember herbal item formulas
and don’t need a formula book for them.
You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead
of Crafting to Craft alchemical consumables with the healing
trait. You don’t need to be trained in Crafting to do so, and you
can use healer’s tools instead of alchemist’s tools.

## Fresh Ingredients Feat 2


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication
It is amazing the difference fresh herbs can make. When
using Natural Medicine to Treat Wounds, you gain the +2
circumstance bonus from having fresh ingredients, even if not
in wilderness. If you do this in the wilderness, you gain a +4
circumstance bonus instead.

## Poultice Preparation Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication
When you create an elixir as an herbal item, you can prepare
it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but
remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir trait.
You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand.
When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item’s
normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate
flat check to recover from a single source of persistent
acid, bleed, or fire damage, with the DC reduction from
appropriate assistance.

## Advanced Herbalism Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, expert in Nature
Your herbalist talents continue to grow with use and you
have become potent at making even more remedies from less.
You can create up to 6 herbal items per day with advanced
alchemy.
Special At 10th level or higher, you can select this feat a
second time to increase the number to 8.

## Endemic Herbs Feat 6


## Additive Archetype

Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, trained in Survival
The herbal items you create use medicinal plants endemic to
your location. When a creature consumes one of your herbal
items, that creature gains the benefit matching the location
where you created that item. If the benefit is not immediate, it
lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated.

Linguist
Whether you study to further your own ambitions or
simply out of fascination with the intricacies of language,
your way with words is unparalleled.

## Linguist Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites You speak at least three languages.
You have studied languages and their development. You
become trained in Society; if you were already trained in
Society, you instead become an expert in Society. You gain the
Multilingual skill feat twice.

## Multilingual Cipher Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Society
You use multiple languages to create and break codes. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Decipher Writing. If another
creature attempts to Decipher Writing you encoded, they take
a –2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all the languages
you used when you created the writing.

## Phonetic Training Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Society
You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy
even if you don’t understand their meaning, and you can write
them down in a phonetic script that allows you or
another creature with Phonetic Training to read
it later. Even if the words are in a language with
sounds you can’t pronounce, you can faithfully
transcribe them. Memorizing long sequences of
words remains just as difficult as it is normally.
### Spot Translate [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype Auditory Linguistic

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Trigger Another creature within 60
feet uses a linguistic effect in a
language you understand.
You bridge a language gap, repeating
the message in a different language
that you know. Choose a language
you understand to repeat the
message in. The linguistic effect
counts as both languages, rather than
only the language the triggering
creature is using, potentially
allowing it to affect a wider range
of creatures. As normal, you can
translate normal speech without
Spot Translate and without using a
reaction, but this reaction allows you
to apply the benefits of translation to
spells and actions such as command
or Demoralize.

## Analyze Idiolect Feat 6


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Deception and
Society
You break down a specific individual’s idiolect, memorizing
their speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with
someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt
to Impersonate that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance
bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense
character study required, if you Analyze Idiolect again, it
replaces any previous idiolect you memorized.

## Read Shibboleths Feat 7


## Archetype Linguistic Skill

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, master in Society
All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If
you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their
regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal
cues provide you with a minor fact about their social
environment, such as their hometown or certain groups
they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being
deceptive about their social environment, such as a
commoner pretending to be a noble, they secretly attempt a
Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against your
Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with
their assumed identity on a success.
Once you’ve gleaned one or more true minor facts about
a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms
into your speech to present yourself in a way
that they find familiar. This grants you a +1
circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and
Deception checks with them.

## Crude Communication Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Even if you don’t speak a creature’s language,
you can rely on inflection, root words, and
body language to infer rudimentary
meaning. If you interact with a creature
for at least 10 minutes and that
creature can speak a language, the
GM rolls a secret Society check for
you, with a DC appropriate for the
language’s rarity. On a success, you
understand the gist of the meaning and
can communicate basic concepts back to the
creature; on a failure, you are mistaken or
communicate incorrect concepts. If you’re
legendary in Society, you can communicate
instantly without needing to attempt a
Society check; even if you didn’t know
the medium of communication the creature
uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you
intuit this information as soon as they try to
communicate.

203

Marshal
Marshals are leaders, first and foremost. Marshals can
come from any class or background, though they all share
a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for the greater
good of the team. Some marshals lead from the front,
sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions
and encouragements from the rear while providing allied
spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their
preferred method of combat, marshals’ ability to bring
the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any
group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies
as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear
both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in
battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated.
Such tactics are often seen as more practical than cruel,
and the results speak for themselves. Quick action and
the necessity to fight drive these leaders and their allies
forward into the fray of battle. Regardless of what kind
of marshal you wish to become, you will lead your allies
to glory and victory.
While many see marshals as traditionally warriors
of martial prowess, anyone could make for a potent
marshal. Not every such leader charges into the thick of
battle. While doing so may inspire bravery in desperate
times, many leaders lead from the safety of the back lines.
Spellcaster marshals often lead in this manner. In their
mind, the practicality of their own survival outweighs
the powerful yet fleeting courage a charge inspires. After
all, more battles await in the future, and their skills may
very well be needed again.
Additional Feats: 8th Reactive Strike (page 80)

## Marshal Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in martial weapons and either Diplomacy
or Intimidation
You’ve combined your social skills and combat training to
become a talented combat leader. Choose Diplomacy or
Intimidation. You become trained in that skill or become an
expert if you were already trained in it.
In addition, while you’re conscious, you’re surrounded by
a marshal’s aura in a 15-foot emanation. Your aura has the
emotion, mental, and visual traits and grants you and allies in
the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against fear.
### Dread Marshal Stance [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Stance

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in
Intimidation
Putting on a grim face for the battle ahead, you
encourage your allies to strike fear into their foes
with vicious attacks. When you use this action,
attempt an Intimidation check. The DC is usually an
easy DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different
DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the
result of your check.
Success Your marshal’s aura grants you and your allies in
the aura a +1 status bonus to damage rolls. When you or
an ally in the aura critically hit an enemy with a Strike, that
enemy is frightened 1. If you’re wielding a weapon that has
more than one damage die (typically due to a striking rune),
you can have the status bonus equal the weapon’s number
of damage dice instead of +1.
Failure You fail to enter the stance.
Critical Failure You fail to enter the stance and can’t take this
action again for 1 minute.
### Inspiring Marshal Stance [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Stance

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in Diplomacy
You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in
battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend
this action, attempt a Diplomacy check. The DC is usually an
easy DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC
based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result
of your check.

Success Your marshal’s aura grants you and allies a +1 status
bonus to attack rolls and saves against mental effects.
Failure You fail to enter the stance.
Critical Failure You fail to enter the stance and can’t take this
action again for 1 minute.
SNAP OUT OF IT! [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Auditory Emotion Mental

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You give a quick shout, hoping to shake the fog clouding
your ally’s thoughts. Choose one target ally in your marshal’s
aura who is affected by a mental effect that allowed a Will
save and has a duration of no longer than 1 minute. That ally
can immediately attempt a Will save with a +1 circumstance
bonus against the effect’s DC, ending the effect on a success.
This can’t end the effect for any creatures other than your
target ally. Regardless of the result of the save, your ally is
temporarily immune to Snap Out of It! for 10 minutes.
STEEL YOURSELF! [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype Auditory Emotion Mental

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You encourage an ally to toughen up, giving them a fighting
chance. Choose one ally in your marshal’s aura. The ally gains
temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier and a +2
circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves. Both benefits last until
the start of your next turn.
### Cadence Call [one-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype Auditory Flourish

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
Frequency once per minute
You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more
efficient rhythm. Each willing ally in your marshal’s aura is
quickened until the end of their next turn, and they can use
the extra action only to Stride. If an ally uses this extra action,
at the end of its turn that ally becomes slowed 1 until the end
of its following turn.
### Rallying Charge [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Archetype Visual

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
Your fearless charge into battle reinvigorates your allies to
carry on the fight. You Stride up to your Speed and make a
melee Strike. If your Strike hits and damages an enemy, each
ally within 60 feet who saw you hit gains temporary Hit Points
equal to your Charisma modifier. These temporary Hit Points
last until the start of your next turn.
### Back To Back  FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You excel at watching your allies’ backs and helping them
watch yours. Any ally adjacent to you can’t be off-guard due
to flanking unless you’re also flanked. Similarly, while you’re
adjacent to at least one ally, you can’t be off-guard due to
flanking unless at least one ally you’re adjacent to is flanked
as well.
TO BATTLE! [one-action] OR [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Auditory Flourish

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
With a resounding cry, you rally your ally to take the offensive.
Choose one ally in your marshal’s aura who has a reaction
available. If you spend 1 action, that ally can use their reaction
to immediately Stride. If you spend 2 actions, that ally can use
their reaction to immediately Strike.
### Topple Foe [reaction] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in Athletics
Trigger An ally succeeds at a melee Strike against an enemy
you are both adjacent to.
You take advantage of the opening created by your ally to tip
your foe off their feet. Attempt an Athletics check to Trip the
target of the triggering attack.
### Coordinated Charge [two-actions] FEAT 12

## Archetype Flourish Visual

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow.
You Stride up to your Speed and make a melee Strike. If your
Strike hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet
who saw you hit can use a reaction to Stride, but they each
must end their Stride closer to the creature you hit than where
they started.

## Tactical Cadence Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Cadence Call
Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions
allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively, even in
desperate situations. When you grant allies the quickened
condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action
to either Stride or Strike, and they aren’t slowed 1 on their
following turn if they use the extra action.
### Target Of Opportunity [reaction] FEAT 14

## Archetype Manipulate

Prerequisites Marshal Dedication
Trigger An ally succeeds at a ranged Strike against an
opponent in your weapon’s first range increment.
Requirements You have a ranged or thrown weapon in hand.
You capitalize on your ally’s attack and use the opportunity
to secure a blow of your own, adding to the oncoming
barrage. Make a ranged Strike with a –2 penalty against
the opponent targeted by the triggering attack. This Strike
doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your
multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike. If this
Strike is successful, combine the damage from the attack
with the damage from your ally’s attack for the purpose of
resistances and weaknesses.

205

Martial Artist
You have trained in the martial arts, making your
unarmed strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor
enlightenment, and you don’t view this training as some
greater path to wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist
striking flesh, the hand turning aside the blade, and the
devastating kick taking your enemy down. Your training
is focused and practical, and since you have turned
every part of your body into a weapon, you never find
yourself without one. While you might have learned
your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training
the body, you might just as easily have learned them in
street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with
intense athleticism for a deadly combination.
Regardless of your origins, your path is one of iron,
transforming your body into a deadly weapon. The
techniques available are many, but the results are all the
same. Whether you attack with your fist, fang, or foot,
your prowess is undeniable. Many martial artists seek
to master a stance to put form to their flurry of attacks.
Such techniques allow one to channel their strength.
However, some prefer freedom in form and reject stances
altogether. You may find your own style or master one of
the forms used by legendary martial artists.
Additional Feats: 4th Crane Stance (page 118),
Dragon Stance (page 118), Mountain Stance (page 118),
Stumbling Stance (page 119), Tiger Stance (page 119),
Wolf Stance (page 119); 8th Crane Flutter (page 121),
Dragon Roar (page 121), Mountain Stronghold (page
122), Tiger Slash (page 122), Wolf Drag (page 123); 16th
Mountain Quake (page 126)
### Martial Artist Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons and
can deliver devastatingly powerful blows with them. The
damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes 1d6
instead of 1d4. You don’t take the –2 circumstance penalty
for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed
attacks.
### Follow-Up Strike [one-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
Requirements Your last action was a missed Strike with a
melee unarmed attack.
You have trained rigorously to use all parts of your body
as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can
usually continue the attack with a different body part
and still deal damage. Make another Strike with a melee
unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as
the missed Strike, if any.
### Grievous Blow [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
You know how to deliver focused, powerful blows that bypass
your enemies’ resistances. Make an unarmed melee Strike. If
this Strike hits, it deals two additional weapon damage dice
and ignores an amount of resistance to physical damage (or
to a specific physical damage type) equal to your level. This
Strike counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple
attack penalty.
If you are at least 18th level, increase the additional
damage to three weapon damage dice.
### Path Of Iron [three-actions] FEAT 14

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
Frequency once per minute
With a burst of effort and speed, you weave a nimble
path through your many enemies, striking each in turn
as you move past them. You Stride; this movement
doesn’t trigger reactions. You can attempt a melee
Strike up to three times at any point during your
movement, each against a different enemy.
Each attack counts toward your multiple
attack penalty, but your multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until you
have made all your attacks.

Mauler
You shove your way through legions of foes, knock
enemies on all sides to the ground, and deal massive
blows to anyone or anything that comes near. You know
that when it comes to taking down an enemy, it never
hurts to have a bigger weapon.
Additional Feats: 4th Slam Down (Player Core 143),
Vicious Swing (Player Core 141); 12th Crashing Slam
(Player Core 147); 14th Brutal Finish (Player Core 148),
Unbalancing Sweep (page 83)

## Mauler Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites Strength 14
You specialize in melee weapons that require two hands. You have
familiarity with all melee weapons that require two hands to wield
or have the two-hand trait. For the purposes of proficiency, you
treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons
and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.
If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain
access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.
### Clear The Way [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing,
shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to Shove up
to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate Athletics
check for each target and ignoring the requirement that
you have a hand free. Then Stride up to half your Speed.
This movement doesn’t trigger reactions from any of the
creatures you successfully Shoved. Each attack counts
toward your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase
your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
### Shoving Sweep [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication, expert in Athletics
Trigger An enemy within your reach leaves a square during a
move action it’s using.
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
You swing your weapon at your foe, rebuffing them back. You
attempt to Shove the triggering creature, ignoring the requirement
that you have a hand free. Unless you critically succeed at your
check, the creature continues its movement after the Shove.
### Hammer Quake [three-actions] FEAT 14

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a non-finesse melee
weapon in two hands.
You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby
creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach,
including your own space. If there’s an enemy in the chosen
square, you can Strike that enemy with your two-handed
weapon. Regardless of whether you attempted a Strike,
you then attempt to Trip every enemy in the chosen square
plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip’s
requirement that you have a hand free.
Hammer Quake counts as three attacks toward your
multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until
after you’ve made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.
### Avalanche Strike [three-actions] FEAT 16

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Mauler Dedication
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.
You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike with
your two-handed weapon against each enemy within its
melee reach. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack
penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have made
all your attacks.

207

Medic
You’ve studied countless techniques for providing
medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer.
While many healers happily practice the art of medicine
in the safety and serenity of stationary buildings, few
are in more dire need of medicinal aid than adventurers.
Such an occupation comes with frequent injuries that
need constant attention. Few parties would ever turn
down help from a practicing medic. In fact, the need
for medicine is so great that many medics started as
adventurers and took up medicine as a necessity. While
patching up injuries is the most common practice of
medics, they are also invaluable for their ability to
help fight diseases and ailments inflicted by all kinds of
creatures and traps. The adaptability and utility of the
medic are undeniable. Whether you studied medicine for
most of your life or picked it up on the road, you are
who people turn to for aid.

## Medic Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Medicine, Battle Medicine
You become an expert in Medicine. When you succeed
with Battle Medicine or Treat Wounds, the target gains a
circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points they regain
equal to 5 HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40.
Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature
that’s temporarily immune due to having already been treated
with Battle Medicine. If you’re a master in Medicine, you can
do so once per hour.
DOCTOR’S VISITATION [one-action] OR [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Medic Dedication
You move to provide immediate care to those who need it.
You Stride, then use Battle Medicine or Treat Poison. You can
spend 2 actions for Doctor’s Visitation to instead Stride and
then use either Administer First Aid or Treat Condition (if you
have that feat).
### Treat Condition [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Healing Manipulate Skill

Prerequisites Medic Dedication
Requirements You are holding healer’s tools, or you are
wearing them and have a hand free.
You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the
clumsy, enfeebled, or sickened condition. If a creature has
multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a
counteract check against the condition using your Medicine
modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition’s source
to determine the DC. You can’t treat a condition that came
from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have
Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases
by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under
certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a
holy character gains from carrying a weapon with the unholy
rune) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.
Critical Success Reduce the condition value by 2.
Success Reduce the condition value by 1.
Critical Failure Increase the condition value by 1.

## Holistic Care Feat 6


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy, Treat Condition
You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add frightened,
stupefied, and stunned to the list of conditions you can reduce
with Treat Condition. If the stunned condition has a duration
instead of a value, you can’t use Treat Condition to reduce it.
### Resuscitate [three-actions] FEAT 16

## Archetype Healing Manipulate

Prerequisites Medic Dedication, legendary in Medicine
Requirements You are holding healer’s tools or are wearing
them and have a hand free.
You resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to
revive a dead creature who has been dead for no more than 3
rounds and whose body is mostly intact. If you succeed, the
target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it
still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased
by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn’t wounded before dying).
Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune
to Resuscitate for 1 day.

Pirate
You live a life of freedom, taking by force and
intimidation all that you could possibly desire. You
may be a privateer, raiding and plundering on behalf
of a particular nation or another authority, or you
may answer to no one but your own capricious whims.
Either way, you rely on intimidation, wits, and combat
prowess to take what you want from those you deem
less deserving.
Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers,
and many pirates have the swashbuckler class (page 158)
or archetype (page 182). Much like a swashbuckler’s
daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often showy
feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain panache.
For example, if you have the panache class feature,
Boarding Assault gains the bravado trait.
Additional Feats: 4th Antagonize (page 165), You’re
Next (page 164)

## Pirate Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to
plunder and great adventures to embark on. You gain the
Additional Lore general feat for Sailing Lore or for a specific
coastal city you have a connection to (such as Port Peril Lore).
You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground
caused by unstable ground (such as the deck of a ship).
Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action.
Boarding Assault [two-actions] (flourish) Either Stride twice or attempt
an Acrobatics check (DC determined by the GM, but usually
DC 20) to swing up to twice your Speed on a rope or similar
object, then Strike. If you boarded or disembarked from a
boat or similar vehicle during this movement, the Strike
deals one additional weapon damage die.
### Pirate Combat Training  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Pirate Dedication
You’re particularly skilled at wielding the weapons used
traditionally by pirates. You gain either the Combat Climber
or Underwater Marauder skill feat, even if you do not
meet its prerequisites. You have familiarity with the
following weapons: hatchet, rapier, scimitar, and
whip—for the purposes of proficiency, you treat
any of these weapons as simple weapons.
Your GM may add additional martial
weapons to this list as appropriate for
your world or region.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## Rope Runner Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Pirate Dedication, trained in Acrobatics and
Athletics
You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as
on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only when
climbing ropes and similar objects. Whenever you succeed at
an Athletics check to Climb or an Acrobatics check to Balance,
you get a critical success instead. You aren’t off-guard while
Climbing or Balancing on a rope or similar object.
### Walk The Plank [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Pirate Dedication
You frighten a foe into moving where you want them,
traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to
Demoralize an opponent. On a success, in addition to the
normal effects, you can also force the target to Stride up to
its Speed immediately. You choose the path the target takes,
but you can’t force it to move into an obviously harmful space
(such as into hazardous terrain or a space where it would fall)
unless your check was a critical success. As normal for forced
movement, this movement doesn’t trigger reactions. The
target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank
for 10 minutes.

209

Poisoner
People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the
insidious power of nature. The bite of a certain serpent
makes the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone,
suitably powdered, induces powerful hallucinations
and delirium. The sap of a rare tree inflicts such agony
that death seems preferable. The deadly medicines
of nature have been molded to create concoctions
capable of both killing and debilitating. Neither option
is pleasant for the unfortunate recipient. You are a
student of such dark wonders, making you a dangerous
foe indeed.
Additional Feats: 4th Blowgun Poisoner (page 63),
Poison Resistance (Player Core 129); 6th Poison
Weapon (Player Core 171), Tenacious Toxins (page
65); 8th Sticky Poison (page 66); 10th Improved Poison
Weapon (Player Core 173), Pinpoint Poisoner (page 67)

## Poisoner Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You make a point of always having a few toxins near at
hand—you never know when some arsenic or the like might
prove useful. You gain the advanced alchemy benefits
(page 58). You can use advanced alchemy to create four
alchemical poison consumables each day. You remember
alchemical poison formulas and don’t need a formula book
for them.
POISONER’S TWIST [one-action] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication, trained in Medicine
Requirements Your last action was a successful melee Strike
that dealt damage against a target afflicted by a poison, and
you know which poison.
Poisons attack specific parts of the body—one venom might
target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while
another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take
advantage of such weaknesses. You deal 1d6 damage of the
required Strike’s damage type and 1d6 poison damage to the
target. If you’re at least 18th level, you deal 2d6 damage of
each type.

## Advanced Poisoncraft Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
You can create up to 6 poisons per day with advanced alchemy.
Special At 10th level or higher, you can select this feat a
second time to increase the number to 8.

## Poison Coat Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines,
and just brushing against them can prove deadly. You
expend a contact or injury poison and spend 10 minutes
brushing that poison onto your clothing or weaving sharp,
poisoned needles into the garment’s fabric. You can have
only one poison suffused into your clothing at a time. You
can use the Once Bitten reaction while you have a poison
suffused in this way.
Once Bitten [reaction] Trigger A creature adjacent to you hits you
with a melee unarmed Strike; Requirements You have
prepared your clothing to poison attackers; Effect The
triggering creature is exposed to the suffused poison, and
the poison becomes inert.
### Acquired Tolerance [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype Fortune

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
Trigger You fail a save against a poison.
A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can
help the body build up resistance against a more deadly
dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the second
result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue
to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you
can’t use it against a different type of poison until after you
make your next daily preparations. For instance, if you used
the reaction on a save against giant scorpion venom, you
could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it
came from a different source, but you couldn’t use it against
wyvern poison.

## Chemical Contagion Feat 18


## Archetype

Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
Your injury poisons can spray onto creatures. You gain the
toxicologist alchemist’s greater field discovery (page 62).

Ritualist
While some learn the art of ritual casting through
rigorous study, other gifted individuals may find that
a combination of natural talent and luck grants them
surprising skill at performing rituals, whether they
want that power or not. Undertaking rituals always
carries an element of risk, but the potential rewards
are undeniable and difficult to resist. You have learned
how to perform rituals and can decide how to best use
their powerful benefits.

## Ritualist Dedication Feat 4


## Uncommon Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all checks to perform a
ritual. You learn two uncommon rituals of 2nd rank or lower.
You must meet all prerequisites to be the primary caster of a
ritual to select it, and you can’t teach it to anyone else or allow
someone else to serve as primary caster unless they know the
ritual as well.
At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn two
more rituals with the same restrictions and with a maximum
rank of half that level.

## Flexible Ritualist Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you
cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters
by 1. When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for
the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check
normally performed by that secondary caster. You can’t
replace a secondary caster who is the target of the spell (as
in the atone ritual).

## Resourceful Ritualist Feat 6


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can cast difficult rituals that might otherwise be just
beyond your skill. You can attempt checks to cast a ritual
that requires expert proficiency if you are trained, master
proficiency if you are an expert, or legendary proficiency
if you are a master.

## Efficient Rituals Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can perform particularly extensive rituals in less time.
If the ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast it
in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast it in half
the number of days, rounded up.
At 14th level, if a ritual has a casting time measured in
days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this
results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual
between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.

## Assured Ritualist Feat 10


## Archetype Fortune

Prerequisites Flexible Ritualist
You can cover for a secondary caster’s error. If you are the
primary caster, after all the secondary checks are rolled, you
can choose one check that was a failure or critical failure, and
improve the result to one degree of success better than what
the secondary caster rolled.

## Enterprising Ritualist Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
Elegant and expensive components are no replacement for
your skill and practice at ritual casting. If a ritual has a Cost
entry that has a value in gp, reduce the amount you need to
spend by 10%. If you critically succeed at the primary check
for a ritual, the gp value of components the ritual consumes is
reduced by the same amount. For example, using resurrect to
bring back a 14th-level creature normally costs 1,050 gp, but
would cost you only 945 gp; and if you critically succeeded
at the primary Religion check, you would spend only 840 gp.

211

Scout
You’re an expert in espionage and reconnaissance,
able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather
intelligence, sneak through enemy lines and report
back to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively
take down your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of
travel for you and your companions and keep you all
alert to approaching danger. It’s not just enemies that
you scout out; you also survey the land. You’re able
to discover the easiest routes as safely as possible and
remain watchful while moving with speed and subtlety.
The responsibility of the party’s safe passage depends
on you performing your scouting duties with constant
and consistent effort. You take pride in your vigilance,
and your allies trust your guidance to ensure the safety
of everyone traveling.
Additional Feats: 12th Camouflage (Player Core 161)

## Scout Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Stealth and Survival
You are a highly skilled scout, capable of guiding your allies,
detecting imminent threats, and avoiding the attention of
dangerous enemies. You can perform the Scout exploration
activity at the same time as the Avoid Notice exploration
activity. The bonus to initiative you grant when you Scout is
+2 instead of +1.
SCOUT’S CHARGE [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your
opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. Stride, Feint
against that opponent, and then make a Strike against it. For
your Feint, you can attempt a Stealth check instead of the
Deception check that’s usually required, using the terrain
around you to surprise your foe.

## Terrain Scout Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You have mastered movement in many different environments.
You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat (Player Core 263) twice,
choosing a different terrain each time. If you Avoid Notice
while exploring and any allies use Follow the Expert to follow
you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the
benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have.
### Fleeting Shadow [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You’re able to quickly disappear and then move about
without drawing the attention of your enemies. You Hide,
then Sneak twice.

## Scout’S Speed Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You move faster, especially when traveling, allowing you
to scout out ahead and report back without slowing your
allies. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. When
calculating your travel speed, this increases to a +20-foot
status bonus.
SCOUT’S POUNCE [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Archetype Flourish

Prerequisites Scout Dedication
Requirements You are hidden from or undetected by all of
your opponents, and you aren’t within 10 feet of any enemy.
You leap from the shadows to strike at your foes. Stride up to
your Speed, then Strike twice. If you were hidden or unnoticed
by the target of these Strikes, the target is off-guard against
both attacks. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally for
both attacks.

Scroll Trickster
Magic has been written down in myriad forms for a
very long time. From the classic rolled parchment to
strings tied with a hundred intricate knots, from baked
clay tablets covered with incisions to bound collections
of bamboo slips, magic is everywhere. You just need to
know how to read it. You have studied the art of reading
magical scrolls of various kinds. The language of magic
is yours to use and manipulate, however unstable and
archaic such writing tends to be.
### Scroll Trickster Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You’ve studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a
comprehensive education in a formal setting or the sort of
education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and
try not to explode anything you didn’t mean to explode. You
gain the Trick Magic Item feat (Player Core 264), and you gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you
roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that’s a scroll, you
get a failure instead.
### Basic Scroll Cache  FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication
You have a vast and overflowing collection of scroll scraps,
riddled with errors and misspellings and leaking energy like a
sieve. With enough care, you can coax these scroll scraps into
functioning—briefly. Each day during your daily preparations,
you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-rank
spell. The spell must be a common spell, a spell to which you
have access, or a spell you are able to cast, and you must be
trained in the skill corresponding to at least one of the spell’s
traditions. You can use Learn a Spell to add spells to those you
can use with this feat, even if you aren’t a spellcaster. This
scroll is an unstable, temporary item (page 174) and loses its
magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you
haven’t already used it. This temporary scroll can’t be used to
Learn the Spell.
At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a
2nd-rank spell.
### Skim Scroll [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication
You can activate the magic of a scroll with a cursory read as
you draw it from your belt. You Interact to draw a scroll, then
use Trick Magic Item on the scroll.
### Expert Scroll Cache  FEAT 12

## Archetype

Prerequisites Basic Scroll Cache
Your scroll collection has vastly grown, both in size and
potency. In addition to your daily scrolls from Basic Scroll
Cache, add a scroll with a 3rd-rank spell. At 14th level, add a
scroll with a 4th-rank spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a
5th-rank spell.
### Master Scroll Cache  FEAT 18

## Archetype

Prerequisites Expert Scroll Cache
Your scroll collection is incredible, brimming with eldritch
power, and you can prepare far more of them than an ordinary
scroll trickster. In addition to your daily scrolls from the Basic
and Expert Scroll Caches, add a single scroll with a 6th-rank
spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-rank spell.

213

Scrounger
You have spent countless hours disassembling and
rebuilding complex items to learn how they work, giving
you the skill to create just about anything from the
most unlikely materials. While your improvised items
don’t last long, they tend to be just what you need in
a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might
be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you
that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate
situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and
the mundane objects around you are the pieces you
use to improvise your own solutions. Few are more
resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and
widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about
any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable
while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what’s
in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared
for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such
as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be
needed, provided your constant attempts to break down
and reassemble everything aren’t a bother. You never
know what you may need in the future.

## Scrounger Dedication Feat 2


## Uncommon Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
While others need specialized tools and a dedicated space,
you have found a way to build just about anything, anywhere.
You can Craft items even without appropriate tools or a
workshop. Additionally, you don’t need a physical formula
book to remember all of your formulas; you pay the same cost
as normal to learn them, but you memorize them all. You gain
the Cobble Together activity.
Cobble Together (exploration) You Craft a temporary item (page
174) out of anything, anywhere, with whatever materials
happen to be on hand, spending only 10 minutes to perform
the initial Crafting check. The temporary item must be one
you’ve memorized or have the formula for, and must be
common, non-magical, half your level or lower, and must be
a weapon, armor, or a non-consumable piece of adventuring
gear (non-consumable adventuring gear appears on page
291 of Player Core). Instead of a single item, you can create
10 pieces of a single type of ammunition. You can create
only the physical item, not any information or magic, so for
example, while you could create a blank journal or one with
random pages, you couldn’t use it as a scholarly journal or
a religious text.
An item you Cobble Together is a shoddy item, but when
creating it you can choose one creature to build it specifically
for. That creature doesn’t take the normal penalty for using
this shoddy item. Your temporary item lasts for 1d4 hours
before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls
the number of hours secretly.

## Reverse Engineering Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication, expert in Crafting
Your nigh-constant tinkering and fiddling with objects means you
are able to reverse engineer items into formulas more effectively
than most. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks
to reverse engineer a formula from an item, and you can attempt
a Crafting check to reverse engineer an item after spending 1 day
of work setting up instead of 2. Additionally, if you get a critical
success on your Crafting check, you can opt to not only create the
formula but also reassemble the original item at the same time,
leaving you with the formula and the item instead of the formula
and raw materials equal to half the item’s value.

## Magical Scrounger Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication, Magical Crafting (Player
Core 258)
You can craft a temporary wondrous item using the magic
scrounged from all around. Once per day, you can Cobble
Together a temporary magic item. The temporary item must
be common, magical, half your level or lower, and be able to
be held, wielded, or worn. Any Craft requirements must be
provided as normal.
You can’t Cobble Together a consumable, a rune, or an item
with runes. If the item must be worn or affixed, removing it
once it’s affixed or donned destroys it.

## Expert Disassembly Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication, master in Crafting
You can apply the same techniques you use to reverse engineer
objects to disable dangerous traps and break apart locks. You
can use Crafting instead of Thievery to Disable a Device or
Pick a Lock.

Sentinel
Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and
as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you
have made it your business to get the most out of your
defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in
the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens,
your solid defenses will safely get you, and hopefully
your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might
be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who
trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor.
On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who
took one too many grievous injuries and decided enough
was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest
plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or
sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel
to increase their survivability. While this is less common,
it’s not less effective. Few will argue against stronger,
heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle
knows, it’s always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall
back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell
than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you
know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won’t
abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough. You
can rely on your armor to see you through whatever
tough fights lie ahead, and the odds always seem better
when you’re protected.

## Sentinel Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

You have trained carefully to maximize the protective
qualities of your armor. You become trained in light armor
and medium armor. If you already were trained in light
armor and medium armor, you gain training in heavy
armor as well. Whenever you gain a class feature that
grants you expert or greater proficiency in any type of
armor (but not unarmored defense), you also gain that
proficiency in the armor types granted to you by this feat.
If you have a class feature that grants you expert proficiency
in unarmored defense and you’re 13th level or higher, you
also become an expert in the armor types granted to you by
this feat.

## Steel Skin Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication, trained in Survival
You wear your armor like a second skin, taking comfort in the
protection it offers. You don’t become fatigued if you sleep
while wearing armor.

## Armor Specialist Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
You have trained hard to optimize your armor’s unique
protective qualities to maximize the materials used in its
creation. You gain the armor specialization effects for all
armors you are proficient with.
### Armored Rebuff [reaction] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
Trigger An adjacent enemy critically fails an attack roll to
Strike you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.
Requirements You are wearing medium armor or heavier.
You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back
your foe. Attempt an Athletics check to Shove the triggering
enemy, even if you don’t have a hand free. If you succeed,
you can’t Stride to follow the enemy, as you’re knocking the
enemy back with the rebounded attack, not by physically
moving towards them.

## Mighty Bulwark Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
Thanks to the incredible connection you have forged with
your armor, you can use it to shrug off an extensive array of
dangers. Your bonus from the bulwark armor trait increases
from +3 to +4, and it applies on all Reflex saves, not just
damaging Reflex saves.

215

Snarecrafter
You’re able to take ordinary materials and use them to
create deadly snares—special traps that you can rig up
quickly when the situation demands. While traps might
grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than
weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair.
Instead, when combat takes place at a location of your
choosing, you have a major advantage thanks to your
well‑placed snares. Once your foes realize that you
may have trapped any location on a battlefield, their
fear of accidentally setting one off can help you corral
them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even
make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them
in place. Fearless enemies face their own disadvantage:
they run a greater risk of setting off the many traps
you’ve deployed. Even if they somehow avoid them,
some cunning snare crafters have the skills to set a trap
right under their foes’ feet. Others have found they
can trigger dangerous snares from a safe distance due
to years of practice. Truly, snare crafters make for a
dangerous foe and handy ally.

## Snarecrafter Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You have studied the art of crafting snares and laying traps,
and few have shown more talent in these arts than you. You
gain the Snare Crafting feat (page 234). When you set a snare,
the DC of any saving throw it requires uses the higher of your
class DC or the snare’s DC. If a snare normally takes 1 minute
to Craft, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions instead.
Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare
four snares from your formula book for quick deployment
(increasing to six snares if you’re a master in Crafting and
eight if you’re legendary). Snares prepared in this way don’t
cost you any resources to Craft.
When you increase your proficiency rank in Crafting to
expert, master, or legendary, add three additional snare
formulas to your formula book. The snares must be of your
level or lower.
Special Rangers can adapt snare crafting techniques to create
snares from natural materials. If you are a ranger, you can
use Survival instead of Crafting for all prerequisites and
functions of feats from this archetype. (This includes using
Survival to Craft a snare.)
### Surprise Snare [three-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype Manipulate

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You install one prepared snare for deployment in a space that’s
occupied by an enemy. It must be a snare that normally takes 1
minute or less to Craft. The snare automatically triggers.

## Remote Trigger Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You’ve learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged
hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm
enemies’ snares harmlessly. You can Strike a snare to trigger
it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit.
If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged Strike against the
Crafting DC, triggering the snare only if you hit.

## Giant Snare Feat 10


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it
more likely for a creature to walk into your snares. When you
prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some
of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-
10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A
giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of
its area, and all its effects apply over the full area.

## Lightning Snares Feat 12


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication, master in Crafting
You can rig a trap with incredible speed. When you create a
snare that normally takes 1 minute to Craft, you can Craft it
using a single Interact action instead.

## Plentiful Snares Feat 12


## Archetype

Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You can prepare incredible numbers of snares each day out
of simple ingredients. Double the number of prepared snares
granted by Snarecrafter Dedication.

Talisman Dabbler
The classic idea of magic is that of a hoary wizard,
poring over a crumbling book of spells as years pass. But
magic is so much more than that—it’s thought, will, and
action, and with the right talismans, you can make even
the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges
on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear.
You know how to make and use the perfect talisman
for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They
can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better,
grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even
save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no
more than exploring just how far you can push your
talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You’ve
heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself
mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical
magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages
have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single
object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation
of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked
up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and
the usefulness of talismans is apparent. Take advantage
of every ounce of magic you can manipulate and master
these mystical trinkets.
### Talisman Dabbler Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical
paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal
classroom or been an accumulation of folk magic picked up
over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas
for all common talismans of your level or lower. You
remember talisman formulas and don’t need a formula
book for them.
Additionally, you carry a vast collection of magical
baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each
day during your daily preparations, you can make two
talismans with an item level no higher than half your
level. You must know each talisman’s formula. A talisman
created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic
the next time you make your daily preparations if you
haven’t already used it. Any saving throw DC required
by a temporary talisman you create uses the highest of
your class DC, spell DC, or the talisman’s DC.
Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can (in any
combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the
10-minute span.

## Quick Fix Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some
string. You gain the Rapid Affixture skill feat (page 233), even
if you don’t meet the prerequisites. When you use it, you can
affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of
just one.
You gain the ability to Affix a Talisman as a 3-action activity
from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your Crafting
proficiency.

## Deeper Dabbler Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
With some streamlining to your process and a deeper
collection of talisman materials, you make a greater number of
talismans every day. You can create two additional talismans
during your daily preparations.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th
level or higher.

## Talismanic Sage Feat 14


## Archetype

Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes
the talismans to be suppressed, but when you Affix a
Talisman, you can specially treat one item you’re working on,
allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special
treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item
for this ability.

217

Vigilante
As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona,
and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal
actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you
adventure and carry out clandestine missions while
keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever
your purpose—fighting crime, inciting rebellion,
sowing chaos—your vigilante identity makes you both
hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject
of gossip. While many adventurers prefer to bask in the
glory or infamy of their actions, you keep that part of
your life a secret. There are various reasons why you
might do this. Perhaps you have something or someone
in your life that you want to protect from the dangers
and threats that your other life. Perhaps you are a
public figure, and your alternate life could draw undue
attention from your community. It could also be that
you don’t like attention and wish to retain the ability
to step away from it all and relax in peace. Regardless
of your reasons, you have a secret identity and will go
to great lengths to keep it secret.
Vigilantes can have many goals and agendas. Some see
them as glory seekers, but more often than not, they are
working towards some lofty goal. Perhaps they are trying
to inspire a people to fight back against their oppressors.
They could be hunting down a crime lord they have a
personal vendetta against. Maybe they seek to rebalance
the wealth of a nation, stealing from the rich to give to
those in need. You are one such vigilante, living a hidden
life so you can fight in secrecy. What will you do to keep
your secret and continue down your path?
Additional Feats: 4th Quick Draw (Player Core 159)

## Vigilante Dedication Feat 2


## Uncommon Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Deception
You have two identities, each with its own name and abilities.
Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while
your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither
of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these
people. If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they
must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against
your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate
action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your
proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with
Impersonate, you don’t have to attempt a Deception check to
interact with someone to conceal your other identity—a check
happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your
other identity.
Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute
and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this
process involves both physical changes such as clothing
and makeup, along with an altered state of mind,
other effects that change your appearance don’t
reduce the time required to change identities.
Your two identities are completely
distinct. Checks to Recall Knowledge
about one of your identities don’t
reveal information about the other unless the
person attempting the check knows both
identities are the same person. Effects that
detect you based on your identity work only
if you are currently in the identity the effect is
trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if
the target didn’t exist.
To maintain the separation between your
identities, some of your abilities have the
vigilante trait. Your class feats and vigilante
feats are associated with your vigilante identity,
and using them while in your social identity may risk
exposing you as a vigilante. If your identity is exposed to
the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to
disguising yourself, but you can spend 1 week of downtime
to create a new social identity.


## Hidden Magic Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication; expert in Arcana, Nature,
Occultism, or Religion
You’ve learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During
your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your
magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this
way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using
detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check
against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.

## Minion Guise Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, animal companion or
familiar, expert in Deception
When you are in your social identity, you can also grant
a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, pet, or
other minion you gained from a class feature or feat. When
changing to your social identity, you also change your minion’s
appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type,
such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising
a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion
to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from
your class features or feats while in this social identity risks
exposing your vigilante identity.

## Safe House Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
You establish a safe house—a secure space in which to hide
your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly
the size of two 10-foot cubes. It’s in a location you have access
to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a
hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects
objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has
the effects of veil of privacy, using your Deception modifier
for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the
counteract rank. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a
week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four
10-foot cubes if you’re an expert in Deception, eight cubes if
you’re a master, and 16 cubes if you’re legendary.

## Social Purview Feat 4


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity.
Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for.
You gain that archetype’s dedication feat and can select feats
from that archetype, even if you haven’t yet gained enough
feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication
feat. These feats become part of your social identity—for
instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication
feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats
in your social identity doesn’t risk exposing your vigilante
identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put
you at risk for exposure.
### Startling Appearance [one-action] FEAT 6
### Archetype Emotion Fear Mental Vigilante
Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
Requirements You are unnoticed by the target creature.
You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.
Make a Strike against your target. That creature is off-guard
against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target
remains off‑guard for the rest of your turn and is frightened 1
(frightened 2 on a critical hit).

## Quick Change Feat 7


## Archetype

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, master in Deception
You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of
spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so
as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in Deception, you
can perform this change as a single action.

## Subjective Truth Feat 7


## Archetype Skill

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, master in Deception
Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that
detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of
view of your current identity, you can deceive effects like ring
of truth that reveal lies.

## Many Guises Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication, master in Deception
You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever
you change your identity, instead of taking on your social
or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely
ordinary. This identity isn’t a specific individual—rather,
you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any
gender, and from a mundane occupation such as common
laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as
if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your
two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check
against the same Deception DC used for Vigilante Dedication.
Using class or dedication abilities ends this disguise.

Viking
To go “a-viking” is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have
spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very
communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally
travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live
aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or,
as they call it, the “whale-road”) to ambush coastal
communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they
charge ashore, plundering and slaying anyone foolish
enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids
is legendary.
Additional Feats: 4th Reactive Shield (Player Core
140); 6th Shielded Stride (Player Core 143); 10th Quick
Shield Block (page 97)

## Viking Dedication Feat 2


## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from
their boats at a moment’s notice, charge through the surf, and
take their enemies by storm. You gain the Additional Lore
general feat for Sailing Lore and Warfare Lore.
When using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain
from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition,
if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Swim, you get a
critical success instead.
### Hurling Charge [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a thrown weapon.
You make a ranged Strike with your thrown weapon, Stride,
and then Interact to draw another weapon. This Interact
action doesn’t trigger reactions.
Special If you are raging (page 72) and end the Stride adjacent
to an enemy, that enemy is off-guard against the next Strike
you make against it with the weapon you drew before the
end of your next turn.
### Viking Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 4

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional
viking combat techniques, and you soon learned to handle
axe, sword, and shield in battle. Now, you can raid proudly
alongside your fellows. You gain the Shield Block reaction.
Additionally, you have familiarity with the battle axe, hatchet,
longsword, shield boss, shield spikes, and shortsword—for the
purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these weapons as
simple weapons.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
### Second Shield [free-action] FEAT 6

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Trigger Your Shield Block causes your shield to break or be
destroyed.
You’re used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle,
and you’re prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby
object to defend yourself. You Interact to draw a shield on
your person or an unattended shield within your reach.
If there is an object within your reach that could serve
as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair—
you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM
determines if something can be used as an improvised
shield. Your new shield isn’t raised until you use the
Raise a Shield action, as normal.
### Into The Fray [two-actions] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Requirements You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon
in one hand and a shield in another hand.
You charge into battle with shield-splintering fury. You
Leap, Stride, or Swim. Make two melee Strikes during this
movement, one with your one-handed melee weapon and
one with your shield or a weapon attached to the shield (like
a shield boss or shield spikes). You can make these Strikes
at any points during your movement, and each must target
a different enemy. Both attacks count toward your multiple
attack penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have
made both attacks.

Weapon Improviser
As far as you’re concerned, the best weapon to wield
is the one that your opponents never see coming. By
knowing how to fight effectively with whatever is at
hand, you ensure that you’re never caught unarmed, and
you often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly
think they’ve caught you unprepared. Whether you’re
smashing someone over the head with a barstool, tossing
a mug of ale in their face to blind them, or stabbing
your foes with a broken bottle, you can find weapons
anywhere and employ them creatively whenever a brawl
breaks out. Because you fight with disposable weapons,
you don’t need handle them with care as other warriors
do, and you can break them when needed to win a fight
without feeling any regrets later.
Improvised Weapon Ideas: Use these for inspiration.
Cavern: broken stalagmite, large mushroom, old bones;
Docks: barrel, crate, hook; Forest: branch, needles, or
thorns; Market: box, fruit, scale, sign; Courtroom
or Study: gavel, goblet, quill, lectern; Tavern:
bottle, mug, serving tray, stool
GM Advice: For a GM setting damage,
typically a one-handed improvised
weapon’s damage is 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8;
one that needs two hands is 1d8,
1d10, or occasionally 1d12, and
an extremely ineffective one might
deal 1 damage. Improvised weapons
typically have zero, one, or two traits,
and often have the nonlethal trait. Agile
improvised weapons usually have a smaller
die size. It’s extremely rare for an improvised
weapon to deal more than one die of damage,
but powerful magical objects might. Improvised
weapons should be fun and don’t last long, so feel
free to experiment!
### Weapon Improviser Dedication  FEAT 2

## Archetype Dedication

Prerequisites trained in martial weapons
You don’t take the normal –2 penalty to attack rolls
with improvised weapons. Improvised weapons
you use have a minimum weapon damage die of
1d6, or 1d4 if the improvised weapon is agile.

## Improvised Pummel Feat 4


## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
When you make a Strike with an improvised weapon
you’re wielding, you gain a +1 item bonus to the
attack roll, and you can have the Strike deal two
weapon damage dice instead of the improvised
weapon’s normal number. If the attack is a critical hit, the
improvised weapon breaks after the normal effects of a critical
hit occur. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level,
or if it’s an artifact, cursed item, or other item that’s difficult to
break or destroy, it doesn’t break but the attack is a normal hit
instead of a critical hit. You can choose not to get any of the
effects of Improvised Pummel on a Strike if you don’t want to
risk breaking the item. At 12th level, the item bonus increases
to +2, and at 16th level, the Strike deals three weapon damage
dice instead of the improvised weapon’s normal number.
If you’re benefiting from handwraps of mighty blows, you
use the handwraps’ item bonus if it’s higher and can choose
to use its number of damage dice. Any property runes from
the handwraps also apply if you use the handwraps’ number
of weapon damage dice, provided they could apply to the
improvised weapon (as determined by the GM).

## Surprise Strike Feat 6


## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
Whenever you make a Strike with an improvised weapon
against a creature that hasn’t observed you making a Strike
using an improvised weapon or that is otherwise ignorant of
your skill with improvised weapons, the creature is off-guard
against you for that Strike.

## Improvised Critical Feat 8


## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
You can apply critical specialization effects
to improvised weapons you wield. For
any given improvised weapon, the GM
determines which critical specialization
effect is most applicable, based on the
type of object it is.
### Makeshift Strike [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
You quickly snatch up whatever is nearby
and then attack with it as an improvised
weapon. You Interact to pick up an
unattended object in reach you
could use as an improvised weapon,
then Strike with that improvised
weapon.
### Shattering Strike [reaction] FEAT 10

## Archetype

Prerequisites Improvised Pummel
Trigger An improvised weapon you are
wielding becomes broken as a result of a
critical success on an Improvised Pummel.
The improvised weapon shatters,
destroying it completely but dealing
an additional 3d6 piercing damage to
the creature you hit with the Improvised
Pummel. This extra damage you apply
on the critical hit doesn’t double from the
critical hit, as normal.

221

Wrestler
Wrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill
against powerful foes. Specializing in a variety of grabs,
holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents
whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated
without taking their life. Though it appears brutal,
wrestling is considered a respectable and innocuous art.
The wrestling tradition is common all over
Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight
for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat.
The discipline’s focus on grappling is also useful in
non‑gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable
to contend with an opponent’s hold. Grappling is
particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a
difficult time completing the gestures for their spells
while grabbed. However, with the right technique, a
seasoned wrestler can hold down just about any foe
standing in their way. Such wrestlers are feared by their
foes and respected by their allies.
Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of
Belkzen, where orcs employ specialized grappling
techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as
mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially
to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe
that the process of subduing them in this manner creates
a stronger bond between mount and rider.
Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common
in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on
powerful grappling techniques to make sure they’re
never left without a means to fight on the battlefield,
even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers
engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient
gods and their past battles. These matches prominently
feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly
technical grappling maneuvers.
Additional Feats: 4th Combat Grab (Player Core 141),
Crushing Grab (page 119), Snagging Strike (Player Core
141); 8th Whirling Throw (page 123); 20th Godbreaker
(page 127)

Swallow you Whole.
### Disengaging Twist [reaction] FEAT 4

## Archetype

Trigger A creature gives you the grabbed or restrained
condition.

locks and holds makes you particularly adept at escaping

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or
restrained.

restrained. This Strike has the following effects in addition
to its usual effects.
Critical Success You knock one held item out of the creature’s
grasp. It falls to the ground in the creature’s space.
Success You weaken your target’s grasp on the item.
Further attempts to Disarm the target of that item gain
a +2 circumstance bonus, and the target takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other
checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. The creature
can end the effect by Interacting to change its grip on
the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as the creature holds
the item.

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
Flexing your entire body, you heave your opponent over your
head and slam them into the ground. Make an unarmed melee
Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On
a success, the target lands prone, and on a critical success, the
target lands prone and takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning
damage. Regardless of whether the Strike is successful, you
immediately release your hold on the target.

### Strangle [one-action] FEAT 8

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
You squeeze the breath out of your foe. Make an unarmed melee
Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained. On
a success, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage equal to
the number of weapon damage dice, and the target can barely
speak until the start of your next turn or until it Escapes,
whichever comes first. While it can barely speak, the target
can’t vocalize above a hoarse whisper, and it must succeed at
a DC 10 flat check or lose any action that requires speech. For
an action requiring speech that is also a manipulate action,
like Casting a Spell with the concentrate and manipulate trait,
the target just rolls a single DC 10 flat check, rather than an
additional DC 5 flat check for being grabbed.

Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.

## Archetype

Prerequisites Wrestler Dedication
Your grasp has a supernatural quality to it, preventing your
foes from easily escaping—with or without magical assistance.
If a creature you have grabbed attempts to use a teleportation
spell or effect, it must succeed at a DC 15 flat check or the
spell fails. If a creature you have grabbed attempts to Escape
while under the effect of unfettered movement or a similar

roll the Escape attempt normally, rather than automatically
succeeding.
### Form Lock [one-action] FEAT 14

of multiple polymorph effects, you can choose which one
to attempt to counteract; the GM chooses randomly if the
separate effects aren’t obvious. The target is then temporarily
immune for 1 day.

to Maneuver in Flight and can combine two maneuvers into a
single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep
ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of
the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult
maneuver + 5. If you’re legendary in Acrobatics, you can
combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of
the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult
maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers
rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

## Armor Assist Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Athletics or Warfare Lore
You are practiced in helping yourself and others don heavy gear.
You can attempt an Athletics or Warfare Lore check with a DC
determined by the GM (usually DC 15 for common armor, DC 20
for uncommon armor, and DC 25 for rare armor) to halve the
time you take to don armor. You can halve an ally’s time to don
armor by working with them to don the armor and succeeding
at an Athletics or Warfare Lore check against the same DC.

## Armored Stealth Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor
and movements to reduce the noise you make. When you wear
non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to
Stealth checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0).
If you’re a master in Stealth, reduce the penalty by 2, and if
you’re legendary, reduce the penalty by 3. If your armor has the
noisy trait, instead of reducing the penalty to Stealth checks,
you ignore the effects of the noisy trait, enabling you to remove
the penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal.

## Assured Identification Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You rarely misidentify an item. When using Arcana, Nature,
Occultism, or Religion checks to Identify Magic, if you roll a
critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you would misidentify
a cursed item because you roll a success but not a critical
success (GM Core 306), you simply can’t identify it instead.

## Backup Disguise Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Deception
You have a specific disguise that you keep at the ready, worn
underneath your outer garment. You can change into this
disguise to Impersonate as a 3-action activity. If you are a
master in Deception, it is instead a 2-action activity, and if you
are legendary in Deception, it is a single action. You can create
a new backup disguise by spending the normal amount of time
it takes you to Impersonate, but you can have only one backup
disguise at a time. Having a backup disguise doesn’t allow you to
remove your armor or any other complex piece of clothing any
more quickly, but once you have those off, the disguise is readily
available. Because you have the backup disguise at the ready,
it’s possible that a thorough search might reveal some elements
of the disguise (see Conceal an Object in the Stealth skill).

## Battle Planner Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Warfare Lore
You are constantly drawing up plans and battle scenarios,
assembling strategies and gathered intelligence for later use.
When you scout an enemy’s position or receive a detailed
report from an ally who scouted the enemy’s position, if you
have a clear indication of the number, position, and identities
of your potential foes, you can spend 1 minute to come up with
a battle plan that takes such potential factors into account and
reduces the role luck plays in the equation. Roll a Warfare Lore
check. As long as the information was accurate and remains
accurate when you roll initiative against those enemies, you
can use the Warfare Lore result you previously rolled for your
initiative roll; if you do, this is a fortune effect.

## Biographical Eye Feat 7


## General Secret Skill

Prerequisites master in Society
In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick up
on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal about
a person’s origin and history. You might notice bits of green
under the person’s fingernails and determine they’re an
herbalist, spy a pin indicating their membership in a secret
society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that
have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city
district where a vampire lives, but wouldn’t learn any of their
weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.
Spend 1 minute in the presence of someone you
haven’t met before, or haven’t met since you first gained
Biographical Eye, then attempt a DC 30 Society check. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged
the person in conversation during this time. If the person
is deliberately trying to conceal their nature or present a
false identity, you learn about their false biography rather
than their true one unless the result of your Society check
exceeds their Will DC.
Critical Success You learn the creature’s profession, their
specialty within that profession, and a major accomplishment
or controversy from their career. You also learn the nation
and settlement where they live, as well as the district in a
city large enough to have districts. In addition, you learn the
nation or settlement where they spent their formative years.
Success You learn the creature’s profession and specialty
within that profession. You learn the nation or settlement
where they normally live.
Failure You learn the creature’s profession and the region of
the world they hail from, but no more.
Critical Failure You learn a piece of erroneous information
about the creature.

227

### Bon Mot [one-action] FEAT 1
### Auditory Concentrate Emotion General Linguistic Mental Skill
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose
a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the
target’s Will DC.
Critical Success The target is distracted and takes a –3 status
penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. The target
can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This
can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait
or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM
determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take
at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic
Charisma-based skill action.
Success As critical success, but the penalty is –2.
Critical Failure Your quip is atrocious. You take the same
penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends
after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.

## Caravan Leader Feat 11


## General

Prerequisites Pick Up the Pace
You know how to get the most effort out of your allies on
the road. Your group can Hustle for an additional 20 minutes
beyond the length of time that the member who could Hustle
longest on their own.

## Concealing Legerdemain Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Thievery
Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won’t
search, you’re skilled at keeping the object on the move so it’s
never where they look. When you Conceal an Object of light
Bulk or less, you can use Thievery instead of Stealth for your
checks and for the DC of an active searcher’s Perception check.
You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use
actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.
### Consult The Spirits  FEAT 7

## General Secret Skill

Prerequisites master in Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Frequency once per day
You have learned rites or meditations that enable you to
perceive minor, invisible spirits within a place. Choose Nature,
Occultism, or Religion when you select this feat. Nature allows
you to contact the spirits of nature that form leshies, who
are born of pure life essence rather than spiritual energy and
can answer questions about natural features like the location
of nearby water or plant life. Religion reveals the presence of
angelic, demonic, or other spirits in service to divine beings,
who provide information about sources of powerful life energy
or energy from the Void; sacred or profane influences; or the
presence of undead. Occultism allows you to contact lingering


## Consult The Spirits

spirits, psychic echoes of the departed dead, and spirits from
beyond reality, who tell you about things like strange auras,
effects, or the presence of unnatural occult beings.
Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to Recall Knowledge
with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually a
very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you might
encounter in the area). If you’re legendary in the chosen skill, you
can use this feat once per hour, instead of only once per day, but
you can’t use it again on any area that overlaps a previous area.
Critical Success The spirits reveal themselves to you and
have a helpful attitude toward you. Only you can perceive
these spirits. They answer three simple questions about
the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the
skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact.
Their answers are almost always a single word, and their
knowledge is limited to within their area of interest.
Success As with a critical success, but the spirits are indifferent
to you and answer only one question.
Failure You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.
Critical Failure You contact one or more malevolent spirits. They are
hostile toward you, though they may not immediately appear so.
They answer up to three questions but give you information that
is harmful to you in some way, as determined by the GM.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, each time picking
a different skill in which you have the master proficiency
rank. You can use this feat with each skill once per day (or
once per hour, if you’re legendary).

## Crafter’S Appraisal Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
Your knowledge of items’ construction allows you to discern
their magical effects as well. You can use Crafting instead of
a skill associated with a magic tradition to Identify Magic on
magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.

## Deceptive Worship Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Occultism
Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as
worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of
Deception to Impersonate a typical worshipper of another faith
or to Lie specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you
are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to
Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive
actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.
### Dirty Trick [one-action] FEAT 1

## Attack General Manipulate Skill

Prerequisites trained in Thievery
Requirements You have a hand free and are within melee
reach of an opponent.
You hook a foe’s bootlaces together, pull their hat over their
eyes, loosen their belt, or otherwise confound their mobility
through an underhanded tactic. Attempt a Thievery check
against the target’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success The target is clumsy 1 until they use an
Interact action to end the impediment
Success As critical success, but the condition ends automatically
after 1 round.
Critical Failure You fall prone as your attempt backfires.

## Discreet Inquiry Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Deception or Diplomacy
You are subtle in your efforts to learn the things you need
to know. When Gathering Information, you can hide the true
subject of your inquiry among other topics of little interest to
you without increasing the difficulty of the check or taking
more time to Gather Information. Anyone trying to Gather
Information to determine if someone else was asking around
about the topic in question must exceed your Deception DC
or the normal DC to Gather Information about your inquiries,
whichever is higher, or else they don’t learn of your efforts.
### Distracting Performance [one-action] FEAT 2

## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Performance
Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your
allies to Sneak away with ease. You Create a Diversion, except
you roll a Performance check instead of Deception, and the
benefits of successful checks apply to an ally of your choice
instead of you. The effects of a success last until the end of
that ally’s turn, and can end early based on the ally’s actions.
You don’t need to be observing your ally or know where they
are, but you need to know they’re present to choose them.
### Disturbing Knowledge [two-actions] FEAT 7
### Emotion Fear General Mental Skill
Prerequisites master in Occultism
You utter a litany of dreadful names, prophecies, and descriptions
of realms beyond mortal comprehension, drawn from your study
of forbidden tomes and scrolls. Even those who don’t understand
your language are unsettled by these dire secrets. Attempt
an Occultism check and compare the result to the Will DC of
an enemy within 30 feet, or to the Will DCs of any number of
enemies within 30 feet if you are legendary in Occultism. Those
creatures are temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The target becomes confused for 1 round and
frightened 1.
Success The target becomes frightened 1.
Failure The target is unaffected.
Critical Failure You get overly caught up in your own words
and become frightened 1.

## Doublespeak Feat 7


## General Skill

Prerequisites master at Deception
You’re skilled at saying one thing and meaning something
different. You disguise your true meaning behind other words
and phrases, relying on subtle emphasis and shared experience
to convey meaning that only your allies understand. Any

229

allies who have traveled alongside you for at least 1 full week
automatically discern your meaning. Other observers must
succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC
to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must
critically succeed to understand the message itself.

## Environmental Guide Feat 7


## General Skill

Prerequisites master in Survival
You can rapidly adapt to climates and help others do the same.
After an hour in an environment, you and up to five allies can
treat the natural temperature effects of an environment (GM Core
95) as one step less severe (treat extreme cold as severe cold
or extreme heat as severe heat, for instance). This reduction in
severity is cumulative with any equipment (such as cold-weather
gear) or spells (such as environmental endurance). If you’re
legendary in Survival, you may protect yourself and up to five
allies, and you treat temperature effects as two steps less severe.
### Evangelize [one-action] FEAT 7

## General Skill

Prerequisites master in Diplomacy, follower of a specific
religion or philosophy
You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your
faith, causing a listener’s mind to whirl. Attempt a Diplomacy
check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target
that can hear you and understands your language; that target
is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your
deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees
with you is unaffected, and at the GM’s discretion, a target that
genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a
result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.
Critical Success The target is stupefied 2 for 1 round.
Success The target is stupefied 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target is unaffected.
### Exhort The Faithful  FEAT 2

## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Religion, follower of a specific religion
Your knowledge of the tenets of your faith gives you insight
into the best ways to get others of your faith to help you or
to follow your directions. When you Request something of or
Coerce members of your own faith, you can attempt a Religion
check instead of Diplomacy or Intimidation, and you gain a +2
circumstance bonus to the check. On a critically failed attempt to
make a Request, the target’s attitude toward you doesn’t worsen.

## Express Rider Feat 1


## Exploration General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Nature
You can encourage your mount to cover ground quickly. When
calculating your travel Speed (Player Core 438) for the day while
mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to Command an Animal
to increase your mount’s travel Speed. The DC is determined by
the GM, but is typically based on the mount’s level or the difficulty
of the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase
your mount’s travel Speed by half. This has no effect on your
mount’s movement in encounters. This benefit extends to up to
six other allies traveling with you, as long as all such allies are
also mounted, or are quadrupeds with a Speed of at least 30 feet.
### Eye For Numbers [one-action] FEAT 1

## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Society
You’ve learned to quickly estimate the number of items in a group
with relative accuracy at only a glance. You immediately learn the
number of visually similar items in a group you can see, rounded
to the first digit in the total number. For example, you could look
at a case of potion vials and learn that it held about 30 vials,
but you wouldn’t know that it was exactly 33 vials, how many
different types of potions there were, or how many of which
type. Similarly, you could look at a pile of 2,805 coins and know
that there were about 3,000 coins in all. You can use this ability
only on items that can typically be counted, so you can’t use it on
grains of sand or stars in the sky, for example.
If you count a specific number of items possessed by an
enemy, such as the number of coins or pieces of equipment
they’re carrying, you can use this information the next time you
Feint or Create a Diversion against that target within 1 minute. If
you do, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check and can
use Society instead of Deception for the check.
You can use this action during an attempt to Decipher
Writing that is primarily numerical or mathematical to gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your check.
### Eyes Of The City  FEAT 2

## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy or Society
You can track down targets with the help of locals. You can
use Diplomacy or Society, whichever you’re trained in, to Track
creatures in settlements. You chat with locals to help follow the
trail of creatures you Track. At the GM’s discretion, there might
not be enough people to speak with to keep following the trail.

## Forensic Acumen Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Medicine
You understand principles of forensic medicine, making you better
at examining a body to determine the cause of death or injury. You
can perform a forensic examination on a body, as described under
Recall Knowledge in the Medicine skill, in half the normal amount
of time (to a minimum of 5 minutes). If you succeed at your check,
you can attempt an immediate check to Recall Knowledge to
follow up on something you found, with a +2 circumstance bonus.
This check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such
as a Crafting check to identify a poison or weapon used or an
additional Medicine check to identify a specific disease. If you
prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall Knowledge about the
type of creature whose body you examined, using the appropriate
skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus.
The circumstance bonus increases to +3 if you have master
proficiency in Medicine and +4 if you have legendary proficiency.


## Glean Contents Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Society
You are adept at quickly scanning loose papers and carefully
discerning the contents of sealed letters without damaging
the seal. You can attempt Society checks to Decipher Writing
on a message that is only partially glimpsed, upside down or
reversed from your perspective, and gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to the check when doing so. You can also use this
feat to decipher sealed letters, adding the manipulate trait
to your attempt to Decipher Writing. This doesn’t prevent
witnesses from noticing your efforts; you might need to
attempt Deception or Stealth checks to avoid being noticed.
In either use of this feat, the recipient is made aware of your
efforts on a critical failure (for instance, you might be caught
rubbernecking or you might disturb the papers in a way their
owner notices).

## Improvise Tool Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can jury-rig solutions when you don’t have the proper
tools on hand. You can attempt to Repair damaged items
without a repair toolkit.
If you have the raw materials, you can Craft a basic caltrop
set, candle, compass, crowbar, fishing tackle, flint and steel,
hammer, ladder, piton, rope, 10-foot pole, replacement thieves’
picks, long or short tool, or torch as if you had their formulas.
### Improvised Repair [three-actions] FEAT 3

## General

You can hastily patch damaged equipment together, but the
temporary fix lacks the full care required for lasting repairs.
You patch together a broken item possessed by you or an
adjacent willing creature. Until the item takes damage again,
it still functions as a shoddy item of its type (Player Core
270). If it’s a magic item or another item with activations, it
can’t be activated while patched together, but can be used
for normal functions (such as Striking with a weapon or
using Shield Block with a shield). This activity restores no
Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is
Repaired normally such that it is no longer broken, it is also
no longer shoddy.

## Incredible Scout Feat 11


## Exploration General

Prerequisites master in Perception
When you scout, you are particularly alert for danger, granting
your allies precious moments to prepare to fight. When using
the Scout exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2
circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1
circumstance bonus.

231


## Improvised Repair


## Influence Nature Feat 7


## Downtime General Skill

Prerequisites master in Nature
With patience and time, you can make bird calls, leave game
trails, and ultimately influence the behavior of a certain type
of animals in the region to favor and even aid you in the days
to come. The GM determines the DC of any check required and
the amount of time your work requires (usually at least a day or
two of downtime). While you can’t directly control how you’ve
influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects, such as easier
hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is approaching. If
you’re legendary in Nature, you can elicit these same adjustments
to animal behavior in the area by spending only 10 minutes.

## Inoculation Feat 1


## General Healing Skill

Prerequisites trained in Medicine
You have practice combating plague, and your patients are less
likely to succumb to the same disease again for a time. When
you successfully Treat a Disease on someone and they fully
recover from the disease, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to saving throws against that same disease for 1 week.

## Keen Follower Feat 3


## General

Your keen observation of your allies has made you better at
following their lead. When using the Follow the Expert activity
in exploration mode, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus if the
ally you are following is an expert and a +4 circumstance bonus
if your ally is a master.
You can share your observations with others to help further
coordinate the group. If the ally you are following has Quiet Allies
or another skill feat that allows the group to roll a single skill
check for an exploration activity and use the lowest modifier,
they can instead use your modifier, even if it’s not the lowest.

## Lead Climber Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Athletics
When climbing, you can prepare routes for others to follow,
and you can pull your allies up to avoid disaster. When your
allies attempt to Climb a route you set using the Follow the
Expert exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their
checks to Climb, you can attempt an Athletics check against
the same DC. If you succeed, your ally only fails instead of
critically failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience
the consequences of the critical failure.

## Legendary Guide Feat 15


## General Skill

Prerequisites legendary in Survival
You know the wilderness so well that you can help your party
travel through it with ease. When you are setting the path for
your party through wilderness terrain, your party gains a +10-foot
circumstance bonus to its Speed for the purpose of calculating the
party’s travel Speed (Player Core 438), your party’s travel Speed
doesn’t decrease in difficult terrain, and greater difficult terrain
halves your party’s travel Speed instead of reducing it to a third.
This doesn’t increase your party’s Speed during an encounter or
allow your party to ignore difficult terrain during an encounter.

## Leverage Connections Feat 2


## Uncommon General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Society, and either Courtly Graces
or Streetwise
You know the right people who can get things done for you in
certain circles. Once per week, when you’re in an area that has
an established group of influential nobles, mercantile elites, or
the like (if you have Courtly Graces), or a network of unsavory
characters such as a thieves’ guild (if you have Streetwise), you
can use Society to Request a favor or aid from those people
as if they were friendly to you. Your request must make sense
for the type of people you contact. For instance, a member of
the royal court could secure you a proper invitation to a fancy
ball, while a local burglar could point out a way to stealthily
infiltrate that same party. If you critically succeed this check,
your connection gives a piece of helpful advice or lets you in
on a small secret, granting you or a member of your party a +2
circumstance bonus to the first skill check you attempt when
acting on the favor. If you critically fail this check, you might
have to perform some service for your connection to get back
in their good graces, as determined by the GM.
### Numb To Death  FEAT 7

## General

Prerequisites Diehard, you have died at least once
Your past has left you numb to death’s call. The first time
each day that you regain Hit Points while you are dying, you
gain a circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points you
regain equal to your level, and you neither gain the wounded
condition nor increase the value of this condition.
### Pick Up The Pace  FEAT 3

## General

Prerequisites Constitution +2
You lead by example and can help others push themselves
beyond their normal limits. When Hustling in a group during
exploration mode, your group can Hustle for as long as the
member who could Hustle longest on their own.

## Pilgrim’S Token Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Religion, follower of a specific religion
You carry a small token of protection from a site holy to your
faith. You gain a wooden religious symbol for your deity for
free. As long as this religious symbol is in your possession,
when you tie an adversary’s initiative roll, you go first.
If you lose this religious symbol, you must purchase or Craft a
replacement and attune it. Such a token usually costs at least 1
sp, and the attunement takes 10 minutes of prayer. You can also
attune a different religious symbol with the same amount of
time, but you lose the benefit of the previous religious symbol.


## Rapid Affixture Feat 7


## General Skill

Prerequisites master in Crafting
You take only 1 minute to Affix a Talisman (GM Core 263). If
you’re legendary in Crafting, you can Affix a Talisman as a
3-action activity.

## Risky Surgery Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Medicine
Your surgery can bring a patient back from the brink of death,
but might push them over the edge. When you Treat Wounds,
you can deal 1d8 slashing damage to your patient just before
applying the effects of Treat Wounds. If you do, you gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your Medicine check to Treat Wounds,
and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.

## Robust Health Feat 3


## General

Your physiology responds well to first aid. You gain a
circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points you regain
equal to your level from a successful attempt to Treat your
Wounds or use Battle Medicine on you. After you or an ally
use Battle Medicine on you, you become temporarily immune
to that Battle Medicine for only 1 hour, instead of 1 day.

## Rolling Landing Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites Cat Fall
You land with quick rolls that help you keep your momentum. If
you fall and don’t take damage (usually due to treating the fall
as a shorter distance), you can use your reaction to immediately
enter a short roll when you land and Step. If you are an expert in
Acrobatics, you can use your reaction to Step or Stride up to half
your Speed after you fall and don’t take damage. If you’re a master
in Acrobatics, you can use this reaction to Step or Stride up to
your full Speed. If you’re legendary in Acrobatics, you don’t trigger
reactions triggered by movement when you Stride in this way.

## Root Magic Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Occultism
Your talismans ward against foul magic. During your daily
preparations, you can assemble a small pouch with bits of herbs,
hair, sacred oils, and other ritual ingredients, which you give to
one ally; the ally cannot be yourself. The first time that day the
ally attempts a saving throw against a spell or haunt, they gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll. This bonus increases to +2 if
you’re an expert in Occultism or +3 if you’re legendary.
### Sanctify Water [one-action] FEAT 2

## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Religion, must worship a deity that
lists “holy” or “unholy” in their sanctification
You imbue water with your deity’s blessing. Choose a container
of water with light Bulk possessed by you or an ally within
your reach. Until the end of your next turn, it becomes holy
water or unholy water. You can choose holy water if your
deity allows holy sanctification, unholy water if your deity
allows unholy sanctification, or either if your deity allows
both sanctifications. This is a temporary effect and doesn’t
impart monetary value or allow the water to be used for costs
of rituals or the like. If you’re a master in Religion, you can
sanctify two containers when you take this action, and if
you’re legendary, you can sanctify three.

## Shadow Mark Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You have learned special tricks that help you follow individuals
without them noticing you. When you attempt a Stealth check
to Avoid Notice while following a specific target, the target
takes a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DC. If you
have master proficiency in Stealth, the penalty is –3 or –4 if
you’re legendary. If you start an encounter with the target while
shadowing them, the target takes this penalty to their initiative
roll and to their Perception DC to determine if they notice you,
as normal for Sneak.

## Signature Crafting Feat 7


## Uncommon General Skill

Prerequisite master in Crafting, Magical Crafting
Magic items you create bear a stamp specific to your
handiwork. When you successfully Craft a permanent magic
item, roll a DC 9 flat check when the item is fully complete.
Any benefit a creature gains from an item quirk applies only
while the creature wears the item (for a worn item) or holds
it (for a held item). The GM might allow custom quirks similar
to those listed.
Critical Success Choose an item quirk from the table and
its specifics.
Success The item gains a random item quirk with any specifics
selected by the GM.
d10 Quirk Description
1 Cavorting Dances in place when not in use.
2 Clean Remains pristine despite filth.
3 Environmental Appearance changes to match its
environment.
4 Filthy A layer of filth always remains.
5 Floating Slowly descends when dropped.
6 Glittering Shimmers and glows with light
bright as a torch.
7 Invisible The item is invisible, but becomes
visible for 1 round after being
used.
8 Loyal Floats within 5 feet of its owner,
as if on a tether (but can still be
seized by someone else).
9 Mood coloration User’s mood affects the item’s
color.
10 Skillful The item grants a +1 item bonus
to one type of skill checks.

233


## Slippery Prey Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics or Athletics
You’re able to escape bonds more easily than others. When you
attempt to Escape using Acrobatics or Athletics, you reduce the
multiple attack penalty for repeated attempts to –4 and –8 if
you’re trained in the skill. The penalty becomes –3 and –6 if you’re
a master in the appropriate skill. If you’re legendary in the skill, you
don’t take penalties for multiple Escape attempts in the same turn.
Regardless of your training, your attempts to Escape still have the
attack trait and incur a multiple attack penalty with other actions.

## Snare Crafting Feat 1


## General Skill

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can use the Craft activity to create snares (page 297).
When you select this feat, you immediately add the formulas
for four common 1st-level snares to your formula book.

## Sow Rumor Feat 2


## Uncommon General Secret Skill

Prerequisites expert in Deception
You spread rumors, which may or may not be true, about a
specific subject. If the subject of your rumor is not currently
the subject of any contradictory rumors, this takes as long as
it would normally take you to Gather Information (typically
2 hours), at the end of which the GM rolls a secret Deception
check against a DC they set to see how well you spread the
rumor. If your rumor matches any current rumors about the
subject, it takes less time to spread, and if you are attempting
to overtake a particularly popular and contradictory rumor,
it takes much longer or may be impossible. The DC similarly
increases or decreases depending on how plausible your rumor
is. For example, it might be harder to sow a rumor that the
beloved, generous mayor is the head of a cult of murderous
demon worshippers.
Critical Success Your rumor spreads like wildfire. Anyone who
succeeds at a check to Gather Information on the specific
subject learns your rumor in preference to other rumors about
the subject. Your rumor persists for 1 month. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation
checks in an appropriate situation when you invoke your rumor.
Success You successfully spread the rumor. Anyone who
succeeds at a check to Gather Information on the specific
subject adds your rumor to the list of rumors they could
learn about the subject. Your rumor persists for 1 week. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and
Intimidation checks in an appropriate situation when you
invoke your rumor.
Failure Your rumor dies off, never becoming popular enough
for other people to learn it via Gather Information.
Critical Failure You are unable to spread a rumor and take a –4
circumstance penalty to Deception checks to Sow Rumors
about the same subject within the same region for 1 week.
In addition, a rumor spreads about someone trying to spread
false rumors about the subject.

## Supertaster Feat 7


## General

Prerequisites master in Perception
You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of
taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of
food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage,
you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which
might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives,
such as poisons. The GM rolls a secret Perception check
against a DC determined by the poison’s level; if the food or
drink is poisoned, on a success, you learn that the food or
drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used. If you
successfully detect that the food or drink was poisoned, you
can spit out the food or drink in time to not be exposed to that
instance of the poison (unless you resume eating or drinking
the poisoned food or beverage).
If you lick or taste something while Investigating or
attempting to Recall Knowledge to identify something, and if the
taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM’s
discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.

## Terrifying Resistance Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
The spells of those you have Demoralized are less effective on
you. If you succeed in Demoralizing a creature, for the next
24 hours you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against that creature’s spells.

## Thorough Search Feat 3


## General

Prerequisites expert in Perception
You take your time searching to ensure you find everything.
When Searching, you can take twice as long to search. Normally
this means you Search at up to one quarter of your Speed, to a
maximum of 150 feet per minute to check everything, or 75 feet
per minute to check everything before you walk into an area.
If you do and the GM rolls your secret check to Seek to notice
something, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to that Perception
check and if you succeed, you get a critical success instead.

## True Perception Feat 19


## General Revelation

Prerequisites legendary in Perception
Your perceptive abilities and ability to process sensory
information are so far beyond the pale that you notice
minute discrepancies in all sorts of illusions and physical
transformations. You are constantly under the effects of a 6thrank
truesight spell, using your Perception modifier for the
counteract check.

## Tumbling Teamwork Feat 2


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Acrobatics
Your tumbling distracts a foe enough to create an advantage for
one of your allies. When you successfully Tumble Through an

enemy’s space, an ally who is adjacent to that enemy can Step
as a reaction, but they must remain adjacent to that enemy.

## Tumbling Theft Feat 7


## General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Acrobatics and Thievery
You reach for an opponent’s item as you move past a foe. If
you critically succeed at your check to Tumble Through an
enemy’s space, you can attempt to Steal something from the
enemy as a reaction. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your
Thievery check to Steal as your tumbling make it difficult for
your enemy to keep track of your movement. You can Steal any
immediately accessible item of light or negligible Bulk on the
enemy’s person, such as a potion or coin purse hanging from a
belt, but not anything inside a container or anything the enemy
is holding. The GM has final say on what you can Steal.

## Underground Network Feat 2


## Uncommon General Skill

Prerequisites expert in Society, Streetwise
You’re connected to groups that know what’s going on in the
streets, and you can get information out of them quickly.
When you use Society to Gather Information in an area where
you have a network (typically a settlement where you’ve
spent at least a week or spent a day of downtime to build a
network faster), you can contact a member of these groups to
get information directly from them. This usually takes about
an hour, and it doesn’t draw as much attention as Gathering
Information in public might. The check and information gained
otherwise follow the normal rules for Gather Information.
In addition, if you have successfully consulted the
underground network, you get a +1 circumstance bonus to the
next check to Recall Knowledge you attempt about the subject
you were Gathering Information on, or a +2 circumstance
bonus if you’re using Underworld Lore for the check. The GM
might change the Lore skill related to the network depending
on your location or the specifics of the network you’re
tapping into.

## Water Sprint Feat 7


## General Skill

Prerequisites master in Athletics
Experience and training have taught you that water has just
enough surface tension for a master sprinter to traverse the
surface. When you Stride in a straight line, if you move at least
half your Speed over ground, you can move any amount of the
remaining distance across a level body of water. If you don’t
end your Stride on solid ground, you fall into the water.
If you’re legendary in Athletics, as long as you start on solid
ground, any part of your Stride can cross the water’s surface,
even if you aren’t moving a straight line, though you still fall
into the water if you don’t end your movement on solid ground.

Your Spellcasting Style
If you’re playing a spellcaster, it can be fun to consider
your personal spellcasting style. Casters of different
traditions usually have the biggest gulf between them
in how they cast spells, but there’s also differentiation
between—and within—classes!
Preparing your Spells
If you prepare spells, consider what it looks like as you
do so. Typically, arcane spellcasters consult their books,
self-reflect, or otherwise study; divine casters pray to fill
their heart with spells that will serve their deity; occult
casters attempt to decipher cryptic messages, often while
referencing occult texts; and primal casters might seek
natural places to contemplate their magic, such as a grove
or underground cavern.
Spontaneous spellcasters, not needing to prepare, tend
to wake up with their magical reserves restored. This
might be a refreshed or vivacious feeling, a teeming thrum
throughout the body, or a sense of impending dread or awe.
Casting your Spells
For one spellcaster, casting a spell is a stressful, painful
process. For another, it’s a moment of triumph as they
outsmart their enemy with just the right trick.
As mentioned on page 299 of Player Core, the
manifestation of your magic might produce different
sensory effects. You should also think about the nature of
the gestures and vocal incantations you use to cast that
spell. Do you chant with a different timbre than your
normal speaking voice? Does this voice resemble that of
your deity or some other supernatural being? When you
gesture, what does it look like? Are they abstract motions
that correspond to different facets of the magic? Perhaps
you always end your incantations with a firm, direct gesture,
like pointing your finger or raising a fist. The particulars of
spellcasting are abstracted, so you can customize each facet
for your character.
Refocusing
Your class briefly describes what you need to do to
Refocus, such as meditating for the monk. Start out with
some idea of what this looks like for you and refine it
during play. What you need to do to Refocus is broadly
defined to allow a variety of methods that make sense
in the story. One sorcerer might absentmindedly twirl a
shiny dragon scale—a remnant of a draconic ancestor—
in their hand with their familiar, while another might
contemplate the flow of a nearby river to remind themself
of the power of water.
Spell Lists
A superscript “H” indicates a spell has extra effects when
heightened, and an uncommon spell has a superscript

## “U.”


## Spell Traits

Several sections within the full rules for casting spells
in Player Core cover how spell traits function, including
traits like morph and subtle. Spell traits usually apply
only to spells, but the traits concentrate and manipulate
apply to other actions. All spells have the concentrate or
manipulate trait (or both). Below are some reminders on
how these traits work with spells.
Spells with the concentrate trait require you to focus
on your magic. If the spell has a casting time longer than
a few actions (such as a full minute or even 10 minutes),
you need to maintain that concentration and can’t
perform other actions. If your concentration is broken
(such as if a fight begins), your spell is disrupted.
Spells with the manipulate trait require you to
physically use a locus or make definitive gestures. If
your hands are bound, you might not be able to cast
such spells. Remember that actions with the manipulate
trait often trigger reactions, some of which have the
possibility of disrupting your spell.

## Spells


## Animal Vision Spell 3


## Concentrate Manipulate Mental

Traditions primal
Cast 1 minute
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 animal
Duration 1 hour
You tap into the target’s senses, allowing you to sense whatever
it senses for the spell’s duration. If the target wishes to prevent
you from doing so, it can attempt a Will save, negating the spell
on a success, but most animals don’t bother to do so. While
tapping into the target’s senses, you can’t use your own body’s
senses, but you can change back and forth from your body’s
senses to the target’s senses using a Sustain action.
ANIMATED ASSAULT [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You use your mind to manipulate unattended objects in the area,
temporarily animating them to attack. The objects hover in the
air, then hurl themselves at nearby creatures in a chaotic flurry of
debris. This assault deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex
save) to each creature in the area. On subsequent rounds, the first
time each round you Sustain this spell, it deals 1d10 bludgeoning
damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area.
Heightened (+2) The initial damage increases by 2d10, and the
subsequent damage increases by 1d10.

## Anointed Ground Spell 3


## Concentrate Consecration Manipulate

Traditions divine
Cast 1 minute; Cost oils worth 3 gp
Area 30-foot burst centered on you
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with certain oils and warding
it against your foes. Choose aberrations, celestials, dragons,
fiends, monitors, or undead. All creatures in the area gain a +1
status bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws
against the chosen creatures.
BESTIAL CURSE [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 living humanoid
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies


## Animated Assault

You tap into the target’s inner being and curse it to become a
bestial version of itself. The effect is based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s body gains minor bestial features. Its
insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be
clumsy 1 for 1 round. When it recovers from the clumsy
condition, its features revert to normal, and the spell ends.
Failure The target transforms into a bestial form for 1 hour. The
target becomes clumsy 1 and gains weakness 1 to silver. It gains
a claw, hoof, horn, or jaws Strike (your choice) that uses the
target’s unarmed Strike statistics except that the damage type
changes to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate.
Whenever the target attempts to use any manipulate action, it
must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
BLANKET OF STARS [two-actions] SPELL 6

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions occult, primal
Defense Will; Duration 10 minutes
A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with
pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the
cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks
to Hide and Sneak. While outside under a starry night sky,
you’re also invisible as long as you remain still. When moving
under a starry night sky, you’re concealed instead.
Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature
that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this
is a mental, visual effect.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is dazzled until the end of its next turn.
Critical Failure The creature is confused and dazzled until the
end of its next turn.
BLINDING FURY [reaction] SPELL 6
### Concentrate Curse Emotion Incapacitation Mental
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Trigger A creature damages you.
Range 60 feet; Targets the triggering creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The
effect is determined by the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target can’t observe you until the end of its turn,
and if you’re currently observed by it, you become hidden to it.
Failure As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target
damages you, it can’t observe you until the end of its turn.
Critical Failure As success, and for an unlimited duration, the
first time each round the target damages a creature, it can’t
observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages
several creatures at once, the creature it can’t perceive is
chosen randomly among those creatures.
BLISTER [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You point at a target in range, and its skin grows searing blisters
filled with caustic fluid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target grows one blister. You can spend a single
action, which has the concentrate trait, to pop a blister. The
target and each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from
the target takes 7d6 acid damage (basic Fortitude save). You
choose the direction of the cone, which can’t include the
target. When no blisters are left, the spell ends.
Failure As success, but the target grows two blisters.
Critical Failure As success, but the target grows four blisters.
Heightened (+1) The damage of a popped blister increases by 1d6.
BLISTERING INVECTIVE [two-actions] SPELL 2
### Auditory Concentrate Emotion Fear Manipulate Mental
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth—words
so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your
diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 persistent fire damage, and the
target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn’t understand
the language or you’re not speaking a language, it gains a +4
circumstance bonus to its save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half the persistent fire damage.
Failure The target becomes frightened 1 and takes the full
persistent fire damage.
Critical Failure The target becomes frightened 2 and takes
double the persistent fire damage.
Heightened (+2) You can target two additional creatures, and
the persistent damage increases by 2d6.
BULLHORN [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
### Auditory Cantrip Concentrate Illusion Manipulate
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Duration 10 minutes
You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily
at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard
loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other
ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the
volume, this doesn’t make your voice jarring or distracting. This
doesn’t increase the range or area of other auditory or linguistic
effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block
or muffle your voice as normal.
Your loud voice makes it easier to Coerce others, and the
acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1
status bonus to checks to Coerce and auditory Performance
checks to Perform at a large venue.
You can Dismiss the spell.
Heightened (5th) Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200
feet away.
Heightened (7th) Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1
mile away.

241

CARRYALL [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Force Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Duration 8 hours
A small platform of magical force materializes adjacent to you to
carry cargo. It is invisible or has a ghostly appearance, is 2 feet
in diameter, and follows 5 feet behind you, floating just above
the ground. It holds up to 5 Bulk of objects (if they can fit on
it). Any objects atop the platform fall to the ground when the
spell ends. You can Sustain the spell to move the platform up to
30 feet along the ground, to make it stay in place, or to have it
return to you and resume following you.
The spell ends if a creature tries to ride atop the platform,
if the platform is overloaded, if anyone tries to lift or force the
platform higher above the ground, or if you move more than 60
feet away from the platform.
Heightened (4th) The platform can carry 10 Bulk, creatures can
ride atop it, and it can hover in the air, not just on the ground.
CHAMELEON COAT [three-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions primal
Range 15 feet; Targets up to 8 creatures
Duration 10 minutes
You shift the colors of the targets’ outermost layer of clothing
and gear to be closer to their environment when they remain
still. Creatures affected by the spell gain a +3 status bonus to
Stealth checks to Hide. The changed color granted by the spell
always shifts to match the environment, even if there are drastic
changes. If any piece of gear or clothing affected by the spell is
removed from a creature, the spell ends for that creature.
Heightened (6th) If a creature affected by this spell rolls a
critical failure on its Stealth check to Sneak within 30 feet of
a creature that would spot it, it instead only fails its check, as
the spell mildly hypnotizes the spotter.
Heightened (8th) As 6th rank, and the status bonus is +4.
CHARITABLE URGE [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Incapacitation Manipulate Mental

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You speak on the virtue of charity, compelling the target to give
away its possessions. The target must attempt a Will save. If the
target has no items on its person, the spell fails.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is stunned 1 as it wrestles with the urge.
Failure On its next turn, before it does anything else, the
target must present the nearest creature with an item in its
possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if the
only item it has is one that it’s currently using to defend itself,
such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can choose
to be stunned for 1 round instead of giving up the item. This
might require the target to Interact to retrieve an item or
move to reach the nearest creature, and passing the item off
requires an Interact action as normal.
Critical Failure As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and
the target must repeat the effects of a failure on each of its
turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt
a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round,
ending the effects entirely on a critical success.
CHILLING SPRAY [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Cold Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 15-foot cone
Defense Reflex
A cone of icy shards bursts from your spread hands and coats
the targets in a layer of frost. You deal 2d4 cold damage to
creatures in the area; they must each attempt a Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and takes a –5-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 2 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and takes a
–10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 2 rounds.

CHROMA LEACH [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range touch; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Fortitude
Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars,
and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The
target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome
trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 round.
Failure The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and drained 1. The
target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if
the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will
save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has
the mental and emotion traits.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is permanently
enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as sound
body can remove these conditions).
CLOAK OF COLORS [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate Visual

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are
dazzled while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes
a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a
melee attack must attempt a Will save. The creature is then
temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the
incapacitation trait.
Success The attacker is unaffected.
Failure The attacker is blinded for 1 round.
Critical Failure The attacker is stunned for 1 round.

COLLECTIVE TRANSPOSITION [two-actions] SPELL 6

## Concentrate Manipulate Teleportation

the destination within range.
Success The target is unaffected.

Heightened (+1) The number of targets increases by 1.
CONCORDANT CHOIR [one-action] TO [three-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Sonic

Traditions divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets varies

You unleash a dangerous consonance of reverberating sound,
focusing on a single target or spreading out to damage many
foes. The number of actions you spend Casting this Spell

Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A cloud of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the cloud, as are those within
20 feet of the cloud’s area. A creature must attempt a Will save
if it is inside the cloud when you cast it, enters the cloud, ends
its turn within the cloud, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the
cloud. A creature currently affected by the cloud doesn’t need
to attempt new saves.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After
the stunned condition ends, the creature is confused for the
remaining duration of the spell.

## Concentrate Force Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Reflex (see text); Duration 1 minute
You wrap a creature in an immobile force field, whether to
protect it or those around it. The field blocks attacks, effects,
and creatures that would pass through it, including the target.
The field has Hardness 10, 40 Hit Points, and immunity to
critical hits and precision damage. If the target of containment
is unwilling, the effects depend on the target’s Reflex save.
Critical Success The target escapes from the field as it’s forming,
causing it to collapse.
Success The field partially forms with 10 Hit Points instead of 40.
Failure The field has its normal effect.
Heightened (+1) The field’s Hit Points are 5 higher on a success
or 15 higher on a failure.

Range 120 feet; Area all squares in two 10-foot bursts
Duration 1 minute
You create two puddles of acidic slime that hinders the movement
of anyone who walks through it. The area of each pool becomes
greater difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its
turn in one of the pools or enters a pool during a move action
it’s using, it takes 8d6 acid damage with a basic Reflex save.
A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes 1d6
persistent acid damage. As normal, if a Large or larger creature
starts its turn in both pools, it takes the damage only once.
Heightened (+2) Create an additional 10-foot burst.
COUNTLESS EYES [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
Eyes form across the touched creature’s body, allowing it to
see in all directions at once. The subject can’t be flanked for the
spell’s duration. In addition, when the subject succeeds when
Seeking, it critically succeeds instead.
CRASHING WAVE [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Manipulate Water

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 30-foot cone
Defense basic Reflex
You summon a crashing wave that sweeps away from you. You
deal 6d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area. The
water also extinguishes non-magical fires in the area.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
CURSE OF LOST TIME [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Void

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 Large or smaller object, construct, or
living creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies
You curse the target with rapid aging or erosion. The effect
depends on whether the target is an object, a construct, or a

243

living creature. Artifacts, along with objects and constructs made
of precious materials (as determined by the GM), are immune.
- Object If the object is attended, its bearer can attempt
a Fortitude save. If the bearer fails or the object is
unattended, the object immediately takes 4d6 damage
(applying Hardness normally), and the item is cursed
with an unlimited duration. Until the curse ends, the item
becomes shoddy and can’t be Repaired, and the curse
attempts to counteract any spell that would restore the
object’s Hit Points. Cleanse affliction can target an item
affected by this spell.
- Construct The construct takes 4d6 damage (basic Fortitude
save). On a failure, for 1 hour, the construct is clumsy 1, is
enfeebled 1, and can’t be Repaired, and the curse attempts
to counteract any spell that would restore the construct’s
Hit Points. On a critical failure, these effects have an
unlimited duration.
- Living Creature The living creature must attempt a
Fortitude save. Ageless creatures are immune.
Critical Success The living creature is unaffected.
Success The living creature briefly ages, becoming
clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 round.
Failure As success, with a duration of 1 hour.
Critical Failure As success, with an unlimited duration.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
DÉJÀ VU [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Incapacitation Manipulate Mental

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 2 rounds
You loop a thought process in the target’s mind, forcing it to
repeat a moment’s worth of actions. The target must attempt
a Will save. If the target fails, whatever actions the target uses
on its next turn, it must repeat on its following turn. The actions
must be repeated in the same order and as close to the same
specifics as possible. For example, if the target makes an attack,
it must repeat the attack against the same creature, if possible,
and if the target moves, it must move the same distance and
direction, if possible, on its next turn.
If the target can’t repeat an action, such as Casting a Spell
that has been exhausted or needing to target a creature that
has died, it can act as it chooses for that action but becomes
stupefied 1 until the end of its turn.
DISMANTLE [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 non-magical object in your possession
of 1 Bulk or less
Duration 1 minute
You touch an object, and it immediately disassembles itself
into its component pieces. The spell fails if the target lacks
component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of
stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap
typically triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and
the component pieces become small enough to be hidden under
normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell.
When the spell ends, the object reassembles itself into its
original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have
them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise. Once
reassembled, the object loses the broken condition, and its Hit
Points return to the value the object had when you Cast the Spell.
Heightened (4th) The spell lasts for 10 minutes.
Heightened (6th) The spell lasts until your next daily preparations.

## Dream Council Spell 8

### Concentrate Illusion Manipulate Mental Sleep
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range planetary; Targets up to 12 creatures you know by name
and have met in person
Duration 1 hour
When you Cast this Spell, any targets—including you—can choose
to immediately fall asleep. The spell ends for any creatures that
don’t choose to fall asleep. Sleepers join a shared dream, where
they can communicate with one another as though they were in
the same room. Individual targets leave this shared dream upon
awakening, and if all the targets awaken, the spell ends.
DROP DEAD [reaction] SPELL 5
### Uncommon Illusion Manipulate Subtle Visual
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Trigger A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns
invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with
a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead
body. If the target’s death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian
at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant
the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the
illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This
ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.
Heightened (7th) The spell doesn’t end if the target uses a
hostile action.
DULL AMBITION [two-actions] SPELL 4
### Concentrate Curse Manipulate Mental Misfortune
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You curse the target to fail in all avenues of its life that require
drive and ambition, as it inadvertently undermines its own goals
at every turn. The effect is based on the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success For 1 hour, the target rolls twice and uses the lower
result on initiative rolls.
Failure For 1 day, the target rolls twice and uses the lower result
on initiative rolls and any check to determine the success of
a downtime activity.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.

FAMILIAR’S FACE [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Manipulate Scrying

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 1 mile; Targets 1 willing creature that’s your animal
companion or familiar
Duration sustained
The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see
through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other
senses. If you Cast a Spell with the revelation trait that affects
your senses, such as see the unseen, while this spell is active,
you gain the benefit of the spell through the target’s senses
instead of your own. You can also speak through the target with
a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre
and character of the target’s growls or squawks. You can use
Command an Animal on the target as part of Sustaining this
spell. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect to your target
when you Cast this Spell.
FINAL SACRIFICE [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Fire Manipulate

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature with the minion trait that
you summoned or permanently control
Defense basic Reflex
You channel disruptive energies through the bond between you
and your minion, causing it to violently explode. The target is
immediately slain, and the explosion deals 6d6 fire damage to
creatures within 20 feet of it with a basic Reflex save.
If the target has the cold or water trait, the spell deals cold
damage and has the cold trait instead of the fire trait. Attempting
to cast this spell targeting a creature that you temporarily seized
control of, such as an undead commanded by bind undead,
automatically fails and breaks the controlling effect.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
FUNGAL INFESTATION [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Fungus Manipulate Poison

Traditions primal
Range touch; Area 15-foot cone
Defense Fortitude
Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to
erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal
2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt
a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half the persistent poison damage.
Failure The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While
it’s taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to
fire and weakness 1 to slashing.
Critical Failure As failure, but double the persistent poison
damage. While it’s taking this persistent poison damage, it
has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

245


## Final Sacrifice

Heightened (+2) The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and
the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
GALE BLAST [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

## Air Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 5-foot emanation
Defense Fortitude
Wind flows from your outstretched hands and whirls around
you in a 5-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes 1d6
bludgeoning damage, with a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is pushed 5 feet
away from you.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is pushed
10 feet away from you.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.

## Ghostly Tragedy Spell 4


## Uncommon Concentrate Manipulate Spirit

Traditions divine, occult
Cast 1 minute
Area 60-foot emanation
Duration 10 minutes
This spell compels local spirits to reenact a violent event of
the recent past that you’re aware of and name as you Cast the
Spell. You take the role of the primary victim. The reenactment
plays out the final 9 minutes leading up to the death or injury
of the victim and the minute after. The spirits don’t change
form, so this doesn’t help determine perpetrators by their
looks. Spiritual forms of missing creatures necessary for
the event manifest as needed, and missing items appear as
shadowy outlines.
Once the scene ends, you take 2d6 void damage for each
ghostly apparition that participated in the scene (typically equal
to the number of creatures involved other than the victim). Any
creature that observed the ghostly recreation, including you,
can attempt checks to investigate the event to discover new
clues and information.
GHOULISH CRAVINGS [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Mental

Traditions divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You touch the target to afflict it with the overwhelming desire to
eat raw meat. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is sickened 1 by its unbidden hunger.
Failure The target is sickened 2 and can’t reduce this condition
below sickened 1 until it first consumes some raw meat; if the
creature doesn’t have access to raw meat, it can take a bite
out of a corpse within reach as an Interact action.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target can’t reduce the
condition below sickened 2 until it consumes raw meat.
GRAVITY WELL [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Defense Reflex
You create a sphere of altered gravity. All creatures and
unsecured objects in the area move toward the center, depending
on their Reflex saving throws. This follows the rules for forced
movement. If there’s not enough space near the center of the
sphere, creatures and objects nearer to the center move first,
and others move as far as they can without being blocked, up to
the amount set by their saving throw outcomes.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature moves 5 feet toward the center.
Failure The creature moves 15 feet toward the center.
Critical Failure The creature moves 30 feet toward the center.
GRISLY GROWTHS [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 corporeal creature
Defense basic Fortitude
This gruesome spell causes the target to grow excess limbs and
organs, whether it be fingers multiplying until hands resemble
bushes, eyes popping open in bizarre places, legs sprouting from
the side of the body, or some other result. The target takes 10d6
piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt.
This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or
no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly
and fall away after 1 round.
In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds,
creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must
attempt Will saves, after which they’re temporarily immune to
this secondary effect of grisly growths for 1 hour. This additional
effect is a mental and visual effect.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is sickened 1.
Critical Failure The creature is sickened 2.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
HAUNTING HYMN [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
### Auditory Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate Sonic
Traditions divine, occult
Area 15-foot cone
Defense basic Fortitude
You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear.
The hymn deals 1d8 sonic damage, with a basic Fortitude save.
If a target critically fails the save, it’s also deafened for 1 minute.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d8.
HOLY CASCADE [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Holy Manipulate Water

Traditions divine
Cost one vial of holy water (Pathfinder GM Core 268)
Range 500 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex

You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of holy water,
tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous
burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the
area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional
6d6 spirit damage to creatures with the unholy trait in the area.
Heightened (+1) The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, and
the additional spirit damage increases by 2d6.
ICE STORM [three-actions] SPELL 4

## Cold Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an
icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail
deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each
creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow
and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder
of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any
creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If
you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two nonoverlapping
clouds instead of one. As normal, if a Large or larger creature is
in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the
continuing damage once per turn.
Heightened (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold
damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures
take at the end of their turns increases by 1.

## Imaginary Lockbox Spell 5


## Concentrate Manipulate Mental

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range touch; Targets 1 container and its contents, totaling 10
Bulk or less
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You turn a container and its contents into an imaginary form
stored in your mind that only you can see and interact with.
The container’s physical properties—the material from which it’s
made, any locks, or other features—are irrelevant to the casting
of this spell, but the container can’t contain any creatures. The
container has no Bulk, and you can visualize everything inside it.
You can retrieve an item from the lockbox as an activity that
takes 3 actions and has the concentrate and manipulate traits.
Putting items back isn’t possible. You can Dismiss the spell.
When the spell ends, the container returns to its normal state,
either appearing in your hands if it can fit there or on the ground
adjacent to you if not.
IMPRINT MESSAGE [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object
You project psychic vibrations onto the target object,
imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your
design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who
casts object reading (page 248) on the target object, replacing
any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is
in the area of a retrocognition spell, the imprinted messages
appear as major events in the timeline, but they don’t interfere
with any other visions.
If the object is targeted with read aura of a higher spell
rank than imprint message, the caster learns that the object
has been magically modified. When you Cast this Spell, any
prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of
imprint message fade.
INVISIBLE ITEM [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object
Duration 1 hour
You make the object invisible. This makes it undetected to all
creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target,
making it hidden to them instead if they succeed. If the item is
used as part of a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile
action is completed. Making a weapon invisible typically doesn’t
give any advantage to the attack, except that an invisible thrown
weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack
without necessarily giving information about the attacker’s
hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.
Heightened (3rd) The duration is until the next time you make
your daily preparations.
Heightened (7th) The duration is unlimited.
LEADEN STEPS [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Metal Morph

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You partially transform a foe’s feet into unwieldy slabs of metal,
slowing their steps. The target attempts a Fortitude saving throw.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is encumbered and has weakness 2 to
electricity until the end of your next turn. The spell can’t be
sustained.
Failure The target is encumbered and has weakness 2 to
electricity.
Critical Failure The target is encumbered and has weakness 3
to electricity.
Heightened (+1) The weakness increases by 1.
LIFEWOOD CAGE [three-actions] SPELL 7

## Concentrate Manipulate Vitality Wood

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area 1 cube 20 feet on each side
Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create an immobile, invisible prison of hardened wood
suffused with vital energy from the Forge of Creation. The cage is
a 20-foot cube made of wooden branches, each a half inch thick
and a half inch apart. Each creature in the area where you create
the cage must attempt a Reflex save. If such a creature fails,
it becomes trapped inside the cage. If it succeeds, it’s pushed

247

outside the cage into a space of its choice. If a creature in the
area is too big to fit inside the prison, the spell automatically fails.
The cage has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points, and
it’s immune to critical hits and precision damage, though it
has weakness 5 to void damage. A creature capable of passing
through the space between the bars (typically a Tiny creature)
can leave; all others are confined within. The vitality energy
suffusing the wood prevents incorporeal undead creatures from
passing through the beams. Attacks with a weapon too large
to fit between the bars can’t pass through the cage, and the
bars provide standard cover even against attacks that can pass
through the gaps. Spells and most area effects (such as dragon
breath) can pass through the cage uninhibited.
LIGHTNING STORM [three-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Electricity Manipulate

Traditions primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one
lightning bolt within the spell’s area. The bolt is a vertical line
from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing
4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex
save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the
spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within
the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two
nonoverlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call
down only one bolt per turn.
Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.
LIVE WIRE [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
### Attack Cantrip Concentrate Electricity Manipulate Metal
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense AC
You conjure up a length of sharp copper filament humming with
electrical current that strikes out at your foe. The wire deals 1d4
slashing damage and 1d4 electricity damage, depending on your
spell attack roll against the target’s AC.
Critical Success The target takes double damage and 1d4
persistent electricity damage.
Success The target takes full damage.
Failure The target takes the electricity damage, but not the
slashing damage.
Critical Failure The target is unaffected.
Heightened (+1) The slashing damage, initial electricity damage,
and persistent electricity damage on a critical hit each
increase by 1d4.
MUD PIT [three-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Earth Manipulate Water

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet; Area squares on the ground in a 15-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
Thick, clinging mud covers the ground, 1 foot deep. The mud is
difficult terrain.
NATURE’S ENMITY [two-actions] SPELL 9

## Concentrate Manipulate Plant Wood

Traditions primal
Range 120 feet; Area 500-foot burst; Targets up to 5 creatures
Duration 10 minutes
Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the targets.
Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it
remains in the area.
- Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each
target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any
time it’s adjacent to the plants and fungi.
- Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its
turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it’s
attacked by creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The
target attempts a basic Reflex save and is off-guard for 1
round on any outcome other than a critical success.
- The target loses any connection to nature or natural
creatures. The target must succeed at a DC 5 flat
check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails.
Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become
hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target,
such as an animal companion.
The GM might decide that you can’t subject some creatures,
such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.
NOXIOUS VAPORS [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Poison

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 10-foot emanation
Defense basic Fortitude; Duration 1 round
You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you
from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you
Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save).
A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes
sickened 1. All creatures in the area become concealed, and all
creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures
within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
OBJECT READING [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object
You place a hand on an object to learn a piece of information about
an emotional event that occurred involving the object within the
past week, determined by the GM. If you cast object reading on
the same item multiple times, you can either concentrate on a
single event to gain additional pieces of information about that
event or gain a piece of information about another emotional
event in the applicable time frame.
Heightened (2nd) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last month.
Heightened (4th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last year.
Heightened (6th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last decade.

Heightened (8th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last century.
Heightened (9th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the entirety of the object’s history.
PHANTASMAL TREASURE [two-actions] SPELL 2
### Concentrate Emotion Illusion Manipulate Mental
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
A phantasmal image of the most precious thing imaginable to
the target appears in a location of your choice within the spell’s
range. Only the spell’s target can see the treasure, though you can
see the vague shape of the treasure—be it a pile of items, a deific
avatar, or a cherished loved one or hero. The target’s response to
the treasure is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target becomes fascinated with the treasure, and
the duration is until the end of its turn. The target can also try
to disbelieve the illusion if it touches the treasure, Seeks to
examine it, or speaks to it if the illusion appears to be a person
or the like. If the target disbelieves the illusion, the spell ends.
Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
Critical Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The
target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell
ends, it must spend each action focused on it. This can include
moving toward the treasure if the target isn’t next to it and
Interacting with the treasure if the target is next to it. (If the
illusion appears to be a person or the like, the target can also
Interact to converse with it.)
PRIMAL HERD [two-actions] SPELL 10

## Concentrate Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions primal
Range 30 feet; Targets you and up to 5 willing targets
Duration 1 minute
Summoning the power of the natural world, you transform the
targets into a herd of mammoths, and they each assume a Huge
battle form. Each target must have enough space to expand into
or the spell fails for that target. Each target gains the animal
trait. Each target can Dismiss the spell’s effects on itself. Each
target gains the following while transformed.
- AC = 22 + the target’s level. Ignore any armor check penalty
and Speed reduction.
- 20 temporary Hit Points.
- Speed 40 feet.
- Low-light vision.
- The following unarmed melee attacks, which are the only
attacks the target can use to Strike. When Striking with
these attacks, the target uses their attack modifier with
the proficiency and item bonuses of their most favorable
weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage is listed
for each attack. These attacks are Strength based (for
the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example).
Melee [one-action] tusk (reach 15 feet), Damage 4d8+19 piercing;
Melee [one-action] trunk (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 4d6+16
bludgeoning; Melee [one-action] foot (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage
4d6+13 bludgeoning.
- Athletics modifier of +30, unless the target’s own modifier
is higher.
- Each target can use the Trample action.
Trample [three-actions] You move up to twice your Speed and move
through the space of Large or smaller creatures, trampling
each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature
takes damage from your foot Strike based on a basic Reflex
save (DC = 19 + your level).
PROTECTOR TREE [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Plant Wood

Traditions primal
Range 30 feet
Duration 1 minute
A Medium tree suddenly grows in an unoccupied square within
range. The tree has AC 10 and 10 Hit Points. Whenever an ally
adjacent to the tree is hit by a Strike, the tree interposes its
branches and takes the damage first. Any additional damage
beyond what it takes to reduce the tree to 0 Hit Points is dealt
to the original target. The tree isn’t large enough to impede
movement through its square.
If the tree is in soil and survives to the end of the spell’s
duration, it remains as an ordinary, non-magical tree and
continues to grow and thrive. The GM might determine that the
tree disappears immediately in certain inhospitable situations.
Heightened (+1) The tree has an additional 10 Hit Points.
PUFF OF POISON [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

## Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate Poison

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude
You exhale a shimmering cloud of toxic breath at an enemy’s
face. The target takes 1d4 poison damage and 1d4 persistent
poison damage, depending on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half initial damage and no persistent
damage.
Failure The target takes full initial and persistent damage.
Critical Failure The target takes double initial and persistent
damage.

the persistent poison damage increases by 1d4.
REAPER’S LANTERN [two-actions] SPELL 2
### Aura Concentrate Death Light Manipulate
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Area 5-foot emanation
Defense Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You call forth a ghostly lantern that guides the living toward
death and the undead toward true death. It sheds bright
light in the spell’s area and dim light to twice that area. The
lantern is insubstantial and floats near you, suspended from
an ephemeral, skeletal hand. Living creatures and undead in

249

the area when you Cast the Spell, or that enter the area later,
must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their
Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing
effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their
Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area. Once
a creature attempts a save against reaper’s lantern, it uses the
same outcome if it leaves the area and enters it again.
Once per turn, starting on the round after you cast reaper’s
lantern, you can Sustain the spell to increase the emanation’s
radius by 5 feet. When you do so, you force creatures in the
area that haven’t yet attempted a save against reaper’s lantern
to attempt one.

## Resplendent Mansion Spell 9


## Concentrate Manipulate Structure

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range 500 feet
Duration until your next daily preparations
You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to
300 feet on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold an image
of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The
mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire,
and it’s decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose
for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments
appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function
normally for anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist
if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can
create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the
mansion function normally.
Your mansion contains the same types and quantities of
foodstuffs and servants as created by the planar palace spell.
Each of the mansion’s exterior doorways and windows are
protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is
audible or mental as you Cast the Spell, and each has a different
sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one),
allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.

Range 60 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Misshapen skeletal forms erupt from a solid surface, such as a
stone floor, and fill the burst. The area they fill is difficult terrain.
Their grasping claws deal 2d6 slashing damage to creatures on
the ground in the area when the skeletons first appear with a
basic Reflex save.
On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell
each round, you can move the area of skeletons up to 20 feet
within the range of the spell and deal 2d6 slashing damage with
a basic Reflex save to each creature in the new area.
Damaging or destroying the skeletons is irrelevant, as new

## Concentrate Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions divine
Duration 1 minute

form, you gain the statistics and abilities listed below. You have
hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You

are 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 spirit damage. If you
have a deity, you can have the weapon take the form of your
deity’s favored weapon and use its damage die size, damage
type, and traits. If the favored weapon is a simple weapon
with 1d4 or 1d6 damage die, the weapon damage dice are
one size larger than normal, though the spirit damage is
unchanged. You can also use your attack modifier with this
favored weapon if it’s higher than that given by the spell.
- Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own is higher.
Heightened (8th) You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15
temporary Hit Points, resistance 4 against physical damage,

You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long
as the targets remain within the emanation. If a creature made

a location large enough to accommodate its normal size.

## Uncommon Manipulate

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Trigger You’re the target of a spell you’re aware of.

SPIRIT SONG [two-actions] SPELL 8

## Concentrate Manipulate Spirit

Traditions divine, occult
Area 60-foot cone
Defense Fortitude
Your eldritch song sends pulsing waves of ethereal energy to
attack creatures’ spirits in the area, dealing 14d6 spirit damage
that causes their bodies to momentarily freeze up from the
hypnotic nature of the tune, depending on the result of their

hiding in solid objects in the area but not passing onward to
damage creatures in other rooms.

until the beginning of its turn.
Failure The creature takes full damage, can’t use reactions until

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Spirit

Traditions divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You curse the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious
trap in its essence. The target must attempt a Will save. Any
creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it’s

a Will save. The curse continues to spread in this way.

SPOUT [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

## Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate Water

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area a 5-foot cube
Defense basic Reflex
Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a
pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the
area take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving
throw. A creature that critically fails its save is disoriented by
the explosion of water, becoming off-guard until the end of your
next turn.
You can change this spell’s area to a 5-foot burst, provided
you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can
be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle
or bathtub.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
STRANGE GEOMETRY [three-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range 60 feet; Area 4 cubes, each 10 feet on a side
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
You cause the areas to appear to swell, bend, and break, twisting
together in a bizarre spatial geometry. The cubes of the spell’s

area can’t be adjacent to one another. A creature must attempt
a Will save if it’s in one of the cubes when you Cast the Spell,
or if it later enters one of the areas, with the following effects.
A creature interacting with the illusion can also attempt a Will
save to disbelieve the illusion, as normal.
Success The creature disbelieves the illusion.
Failure All terrain in the cubes is difficult terrain for the creature,
including the air if the creature is flying, walls if it’s climbing,
and so on. When the creature would exit one of the cubes,
it exits from one randomly determined by the GM. This is a
teleportation effect. It can exit from any edge of that cube
it chooses. When selecting a random cube, the GM excludes
any that don’t match the creature’s terrain; for instance, if
the creature were exiting along the ground, the GM would
exclude any cube that didn’t have an exit on the ground.
SUDDEN BLIGHT [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate Void

Traditions divine, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Fortitude
You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living
creature in the area takes 2d10 void damage with a basic
Fortitude save. A creature afflicted by a disease takes a –2
circumstance penalty to this save.
You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny
non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical
undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and
concealment. Sudden blight attempts to counteract any magical
effect on the plants before withering them.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10.
SUMMON LESSER SERVITOR [three-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Summon

Traditions divine
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
While deities jealously guard their most powerful servants
from the summoning spells of those who aren’t steeped in the
faith, this spell allows you to conjure an inhabitant of the Outer
Sphere with or without the deity’s permission. You summon
a celestial, fiend, or monitor of level –1. You can choose to
instead summon an animal of level –1 that hails from the Outer
Sphere; you can choose for this animal to gain the celestial and
holy traits, the fiend and unholy traits, or the monitor trait.
It’s anathema to summon a servitor if it has a holy or
unholy trait that isn’t allowed for your deity’s sanctification.
For example, Sarenrae’s sanctification is “can choose holy,” so
you couldn’t summon an unholy creature, and Pharasma’s is
“none,” so you couldn’t summon a holy or unholy creature.
The GM might determine that your deity restricts specific
types of creatures further, making it anathema to summon
them as well.
Heightened (2nd) The creature can be level 1 or lower.
Heightened (3rd) The creature can be level 2 or lower.
Heightened (4th) The creature can be level 3 or lower.
SYNESTHESIA [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate Mental

Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
The target’s senses are suddenly rewired in unexpected ways,
causing them to process noises as bursts of color, smells as
sounds, and so on. This has three effects, and the target must
attempt a Will save.
- Due to the distraction, the target must succeed at a DC 5
flat check each time it uses a concentrate action, or the
action fails and is wasted.
- The target’s difficulty processing visual input makes all
creatures and objects concealed from it.
- The creature has trouble moving, making it clumsy 3 and
giving it a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is affected for 1 round.
Failure The target is affected for 1 minute.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target is stunned 2 as it
attempts to process the sensory shifts.
Heightened (9th) You can target up to five creatures.
TELEPATHIC DEMAND [three-actions] SPELL 9
### Concentrate Incapacitation Linguistic Manipulate Mental
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature you’ve telepathically
contacted before
Defense Will; Duration varies
You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it
can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words
or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of a
suggestion spell, with the message substituting for the spoken
suggestion. On a successful save, the target is temporarily
immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the target is
temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a creature only
if you’ve previously been in telepathic contact with it before,
such as via the telepathy spell.
THOUGHTFUL GIFT [one-action] SPELL 1

## Manipulate Teleportation

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your
hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target’s
hand if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don’t. The
target knows what object you’re attempting to send them. If
the target is unconscious or refuses to accept your gift, or if the
spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an
extradimensional container), the spell fails.
Heightened (3rd) The spell’s range increases to 500 feet.
Heightened (5th) As 3rd level, and the object’s maximum Bulk
increases to 1. You can Cast the Spell with 3 actions instead of
1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile, and you don’t need
line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar
with the target.

## Threefold Aspect Spell 3


## Concentrate Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions occult, primal
Cast 1 minute
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
This spell allows you to change between three versions of
yourself of different ages: a maiden (young adult), a mother
(adult), or a matriarch (elderly). Choose one when you Cast the
Spell. While the spell lasts, you can change the age to any
of the three or to your natural age by Sustaining the spell.
Your form always looks like you regardless of the age, and
creatures who know you still recognize you and can tell your
age is different.
Threefold aspect alters your physical appearance and
personality to present an authentic version of yourself at
various ages. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception
checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your
level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you’re
untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses
a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn’t
get a chance to notice that you aren’t at your true age. You
can Dismiss this spell.
VAMPIRIC MAIDEN [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Manipulate Void

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude
A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its
vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4
void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save.
You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the void damage the
target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and
the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after
1 minute.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden.
The target takes full damage and is immobilized by the iron
maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to
extricate itself, whichever comes first.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is
immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it
Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.
Heightened (+1) The piercing and void damage increase by
1d4 each.
VISIONS OF DANGER [three-actions] SPELL 7
### Auditory Concentrate Illusion Manipulate Visual
Traditions occult
Range 500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Defense basic Will; Duration 1 minute
An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell’s area. The creatures
look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of
your choice, such as fiendish flies or animated saw blades. The
burst deals 8d8 mental damage with a basic Will save to each
creature that’s inside the burst when it’s created, enters the
burst, or starts its turn inside the burst. A creature that critically
succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to disbelieve
the illusion. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters
or observes one with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the
illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage
from the illusion thereafter.
Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by 1d8.
VOMIT SWARM [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Area 30-foot cone
Defense basic Reflex
You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and
shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you
to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of
centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn’t change
the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the
area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage (basic
Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes
sickened 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.
WALL OF FLESH [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions divine, occult, primal
Range 60 feet
Duration 1 minute
You craft a 20-foot-tall wall of living flesh in a straight line up to
30 feet long. The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section
has AC 10 and 75 Hit Points. If you wish, the wall can be of a
smaller length or height. You must create the wall in an unbroken
open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or
objects, or the spell is lost. The wall can’t be Repaired but can be
healed by vitality, and healing spells and abilities.
When you Cast the Spell, choose one of the following features
for your wall.
- Mouths The wall has countless toothy mouths along its
surface. The mouths Strike any creature that ends its turn
within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack modifier
for these Strikes and dealing 2d6 piercing damage. The
mouths are capable of consuming potions; since the wall is
alive, it can recover Hit Points from a healing potion, but it
can’t benefit from any effect that would give it the ability
to move. Otherwise, the GM determines which potions can
affect the wall.
- Eyes The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You
can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance
bonus to visual Perception checks within the wall’s line
of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line of
sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don’t have line
of effect through the wall.
- Arms The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature
that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt a
Reflex save.

Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is grabbed by the wall for 1 round
or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever
comes first.
Critical Failure The creature is restrained by the wall
for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC,
whichever comes first.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 10, and the piercing damage dealt by the wall’s
mouths increases by 1d6.

## Wanderer’S Guide Spell 3


## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions divine, occult
Cast 1 minute
Duration until your next daily preparations
You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast
this Spell, choose a destination; you receive an inspired route
to that destination, allowing you and allies who travel overland
with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult terrain
by half for the duration, as long as you don’t deviate from the
inspired route. This doesn’t have any effect on movement during
encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is
over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.
WEAPON OF JUDGMENT [two-actions] SPELL 9

## Concentrate Manipulate Sanctified Spirit

Traditions divine
Requirements You have a deity.
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
An immense weapon of spiritual energy appears, hovering in
the air above the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual
appearance of your deity’s favored weapon. Name war or
peace when you cast this spell.
If you name “war,” mentally choose one creature. This must be a
creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively
knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target’s
turns, if the target didn’t use a hostile action against the creature
you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target.
If you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The
target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon
Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action
against you or one of the chosen allies. The weapon Strikes
only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies
(such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike).
Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they
use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the
weapon deals 4d10 damage. The damage type is the same as
the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon).
The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more
detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). No
other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a
ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. The weapon
takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout
the target’s turn, but its penalty is separate from yours.
A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers,
resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn’t take up space,
grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would.
The weapon can’t make any attack other than its Strike, and
feats or spells that affect weapons don’t apply to this weapon.
Heightened (10th) The damage increases by 1d10.
WEB [three-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures’
movement. Squares filled with the web are difficult terrain.
Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or
enters the web during a move action it’s using, it must attempt
an Athletics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to
avoid taking a circumstance penalty to its Speeds or becoming
immobilized. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to take
a circumstance penalty to its Speed from the web.
Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or
effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A
square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and it doesn’t need
to attempt further Athletics checks or saving throws against
the web this turn. If it used an Athletics check, it clears the
web from every square it leaves during its movement.
Success The creature is unaffected during its action. If it used an
Athletics check, it clears the web from every square it leaves
during its movement.
Failure The creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its
Speeds until the start of its next turn.
Critical Failure The creature is immobilized until the start of
its next turn, after which it takes a –10-foot circumstance
penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. It can attempt to Escape to
remove its immobilized condition.
Heightened (4th) The spell’s area increases to a 20-foot burst,
and its range increases to 60 feet.
WHISPERS OF THE VOID [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Auditory Concentrate Manipulate Void

Traditions divine, occult
Range 60 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Fortitude
You whisper baleful secrets that transcend language and carry
magically to the ears of your foes. The words take physical form,
weakening the life force of the targets, each of which must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes 2d8 persistent void damage.
Failure The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage and
becomes drained 1.
Critical Failure The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage
and becomes drained 2 and doomed 1.
Heightened (+2) The persistent void damage increases by 1d8
on a success, or by 2d8 on a failure or critical failure.

stead. All the effects of the hit or failed save are applied to you
instead of the target. For example, if the target critically fails a
saving throw against a fireball, you would take double damage.
These effects ignore any resistances, immunities, or other abilities
you have that might mitigate them in any way, although those of
the target apply before you take the effect.
HERO’S DEFIANCE [free-action] FOCUS 10
### Uncommon Champion Concentrate Focus Healing Vitality
Trigger An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.
You shout in defiance and are filled with a burst of healing. Just
before applying the attack’s damage, you recover 6d8+20 Hit
Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you
to 0 Hit Points, you don’t become unconscious or dying. Either
way, cheating death is difficult, and you can’t use hero’s defiance
again until you Refocus or make your daily preparations. Hero’s
defiance can’t be used against effects with the death trait or that
would leave no remains, such as disintegrate.
SPECTRAL ADVANCE [one-action] OR [two-actions] FOCUS 5
### Uncommon Champion Concentrate Focus Polymorph Spirit
Taking on a spiritual form, you flash across the battlefield to
engage an enemy. You Stride to a space adjacent to an enemy. If

once. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly instead of Striding. If
you’re mounted, you can have your mount move instead of you.
Movement from spectral advance doesn’t trigger reactions and
ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain. During the
movement, you (or your mount) have resistance equal to your
level to all damage.

or void damage. All your Strikes deal 1d6 additional damage
of the chosen type. Your entire body is also surrounded by

a light effect. Your corona is an aura in a 5-foot emanation
that deals 2d6 damage of the chosen type to creatures
who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation
overlaps with a darkness effect, the corona’s glow attempts

Ground in the area turns swampy and fetid. The area is difficult
terrain. The sludge at the bottom of the morass animates into

swamp deals 1d6 poison damage to creatures that end their
turn in the area (basic Fortitude save). For each additional
action you use when Casting the Spell, increase the burst’s
radius by 5 feet.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6, and the initial
radius increases by 5 feet.

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute

greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse
condition depending on its highest attribute modifier: Strength

## Uncommon Focus Manipulate Sorcerer

Trigger A creature within range that you can see Casts a Spell.
Range 120 feet; Targets the spell cast by the triggering creature
You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend
against. You reduce the spell’s rank by 1, and targets of the spell
gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC,
or DC against it.
You can’t reduce the spell’s rank below its minimum. For
example, a 5th-rank howling blizzard would remain 5th-rank,
but a 5th-rank fireball would become 4th-rank. Targets still gain
all the other benefits, even if you don’t reduce the spell’s rank.
Undead

## Astral Projection Ritual 5


## Uncommon

Cast 1 hour; Cost one gem worth a total value of the target’s
level (minimum 1) × 5 gp, for each target; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary Checks
Arcana or Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the primary
check), Survival
Range touch; Targets yourself and up to 5 willing creatures
Duration see text
You project the targets’ spiritual essences into the Astral Plane,
leaving their inanimate physical forms behind. These astral
forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while
the targets’ bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where
the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can’t
be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact
with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and
all targets must be selected from these casters.
A target’s astral form is a duplicate of the target and
everything they’re carrying; anything that happens to a
duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if
you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item’s duplicate,
the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration
of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to
Dismiss their astral form and immediately return to their
physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your
astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets’ astral
forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their
physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the
other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they
become separated from you, they must wait for your return
or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the
targets’ astral forms vanish.
A target’s astral form and corresponding physical form are
linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the
Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as conduit and
safety line; if severed, the target’s astral and physical forms are
both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external
force, such as dispel magic being cast on a target’s physical or
astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned
to their physical body. If a target’s astral form is slain, the silver
cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain
requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as
the ritual’s primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a
success, it becomes clumsy 2, drained 2, doomed 2, and enfeebled
2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by
any means until the week has passed. A target’s physical body
remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but
if it’s destroyed, the creature dies and its astral form also vanishes.
This ritual only projects a portion of the targets’ consciousnesses
onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically to the Astral Plane
(to reach the Outer Planes, for example) requires spells such as
interplanar teleport.
Critical Success All targets are able to navigate independently
in the Astral Plane. Each target’s silver cord is stronger than
usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to its Fortitude
save to avoid dying if its astral form dies.
Success You successfully project the targets.
Failure You fail to project the targets.
Critical Failure The process of separating the targets’ spirits
from their bodies is complicated, and something goes
catastrophically wrong. All casters become doomed 1, are
immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and begin dying.

## Clone Ritual 9


## Rare

Cast 7 days; Cost rare laboratory supplies and reagents worth the
target’s level (minimum 1) × 100 gp; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Crafting (legendary); Secondary Checks Arcana,
Medicine, Occultism
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature up to 20th level
You collect hair, nail clippings, and samples of skin and blood
from the target, who must be present throughout the ritual and
can be one of the casters. You then use those samples to grow a
duplicate of the target’s physical form that will house the target’s
soul upon death. This duplicate is physically identical to the
original creature.
In order to perform the ritual, you need an expanded
alchemist’s lab (Player Core 287) or a superior set of equipment.
Once the ritual is successfully completed, the duplicate grows
within the laboratory equipment for 2d4 months. Though direct
involvement isn’t required during this period of growth, you must
prevent any interference or interruption, or the ritual fails. When
the duplicate is complete, the original creature’s soul enters it as
soon as their original body dies, or immediately if the creature

## Rituals


died during the intervening months, as long as the soul is free
and willing. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has
come or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, the
duplicate remains empty until the impediment is removed. While
unoccupied, the inert duplicate must be preserved in suitable
alchemical equipment to prevent it from rotting.
Critical Success The cloning process is successful. When the
soul occupies the completed clone, it is clumsy 1, drained 1,
doomed 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be
removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.
Success As critical success, but each condition value is 2.
Failure You fail to form the clone.
Critical Failure The clone appears to be successful, but something
went horribly wrong. Once it grows to its full size, it can’t hold
the target’s soul and instead houses a malevolent intelligence
or an invasive creature (such as a powerful demon).

## Fantastic Facade Ritual 9


## Rare Illusion

Cast 1 week; Cost mystical paint, elaborate veils, and powdered
minerals worth 20,000 gp total; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (legendary); Secondary
Checks Deception; Society or Survival; Stealth
Area up to 1 mile radius circle centered on you; Targets 1
settlement and its residents
Duration unlimited
You draw a permanent series of complex illusions over the target
settlement, choosing the look, sound, feel, and smell of the
structures, terrain, and creatures within at the time the ritual
is cast. You can alter the appearance of existing structures and
creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures. For
example, you could cause everything and everyone in the target
area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a thick canopy
that obscures the settlement from outside view, or make empty
ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you create the facade,
you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to
basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and
which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the
town square, complete with marching band). You’re unable to
alter the programs after you create the facade.
You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects
as a 3rd-rank illusory disguise. If a creature affected by the facade
leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You
decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised
by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or
after a set period, up to 1 week.
A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way
that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade,
such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or
climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the
illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an
illusory river of lava wouldn’t cause damage, nor could thorns on
an illusory rose bush prick someone.
Critical Success You create the facade as described, and you can
alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day to
reprogram them.
Success You create the facade as described.
Failure Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Your ritual produces unexpected and uncontrolled
illusions different from what you had planned, such as
unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the buildings,
unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as skeletons.
These effects fade after 1 month.
Heightened (10th) The cost increases to 100,000 gp and the
radius can be up to 5 miles.

## Fortifying Brew Ritual 5


## Uncommon

Cast 4 hours; Cost high-quality ingredients and brewing
equipment worth 25 gp; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Crafting, Nature, or Society (expert); Secondary
Checks Alcohol Lore (or related lore), Crafting, Society
Range 20 feet
You craft a large quantity of restorative drink, such as an
invigorating tea, a refreshing ale, or a stimulative alchemical
tonic. The ritual speeds along any natural processes to make the
brew, such as fermenting fruit to make a wine. At the conclusion
of the first 3 hours of the ritual, you produce enough brew for
up to 10 people to drink, any of whom can be the secondary
caster of the ritual. The brew must then be consumed over the
next hour. There is no danger of the drinkers becoming drunk if
the brew is alcoholic. Once that hour is completed, you and the
secondary caster attempt your checks as normal.
Critical Success The brew is delicious and revitalizing. It casts a
4th-rank cleanse affliction, a 4th-rank clear mind, and a 4thrank
sound body on each drinker for each relevant affliction
or condition, using your modifier for the primary skill check
as the counteract modifier. Each drinker also gains 20
temporary Hit Points that last 12 hours and a +2 status bonus
to saves against diseases and poisons for the next 12 hours.
Success As critical success, except drinkers gain only 10
temporary Hit Points, and don’t gain the status bonus to saves.
Failure You and the other drinkers are left with a sour taste—
something went wrong with the brewing process.
Critical Failure Your attempt to craft the drink resulted in
something more akin to a poison. You and the other drinkers
become sickened 4 and can’t reduce the condition for 12 hours.
Heightened (+1) The temporary Hit Points increases by 2 (or 4
on a critical success).

## Gathering Call Ritual 7


## Rare Teleportation

Cast 7 days; Cost rare oils and powdered minerals worth 5,000 gp;
Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (expert, the check has
the secret trait); Secondary Checks Arcana or Occultism
(whichever isn’t used for the primary check), Society
Range 20 feet; Targets up to seven willing creatures of 14th
level or lower
Duration 1 year
You bind yourself and your allies to the specific safe location,
referred to as a sanctuary, where you perform the ritual. This

267

allows the participants to return later by simply speaking a word.
Success You form the connection with the sanctuary. Any
participant in the ritual can Dismiss the ritual. When they do,
all the participants can immediately return to the sanctuary
from any distance, as long as they are on the same plane
as the sanctuary. Each participant arrives in the position in
which they were standing during the casting of the ritual.
When the word is spoken, all other participants know it, and
each can choose whether or not to return to the sanctuary at
that time. The ritual then immediately ends.
Failure You fail to form the connection between the participants
and the sanctuary and are aware that the ritual has failed.
Critical Failure The ritual inadvertently forms a connection
with a location on another plane. The casters are unaware
of this misalignment. When the word is invoked, all ritual
participants are shifted to this extraplanar location.
Heightened (+1) The cost increases by 5,000 gp, the ritual can
target one more creature, and the maximum level of creature
it can target increases by 2.

## Heartbond Ritual 2


## Uncommon

Cast 1 hour; Cost sacramental beverages and a set of matching
rings or other tokens worth 20 gp per secondary caster;
Secondary Casters 2 or more
Primary Check Nature or Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Diplomacy, Society
Range 20 feet
You officiate the creation of a magical bond between two or
more willing creatures, who are secondary casters of the ritual
and must share genuine affection for one another. As part of
the ritual, all members of the bond receive a ring, amulet, or
similar token to symbolize their shared connection. They lose
the effects of the ritual when not wearing the token, and the
bond is broken if either token is destroyed.
Creatures benefiting from a successful heartbond ritual can
later participate in a heightened version of the ritual without
requiring new checks by spending the required time and paying
the difference of the two costs. A creature can be under the
effects of multiple heartbond rituals at once.
Critical Success Once per day, each bonded creature can use a
2-action activity, which has the concentrate trait, to learn the
present state of one other bonded creature. The creature knows
the other creature’s direction and distance and any conditions
affecting them. Each participant can cast message as a divine
innate spell at will, but can target only another participant.
Success As a critical success, except the bonded creatures can’t
cast message as a divine innate spell.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Magical backlash creates discordant energy
among the participants. For 1 week, each secondary caster is
clumsy 2 and stupefied 2 whenever they are within 30 feet
of another secondary caster.
Heightened (6th) The cost increases to 300 gp per secondary
caster. On a success, secondary casters permanently gain the
effects of a 6th-rank telepathy spell, but only with each other.

## Inveigle Ritual 2


## Uncommon Mental

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils worth a total value of 10 gp × the
target’s level
Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or Religion
(expert)
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 creature of a level no greater than
double the inveigle ritual’s rank
Duration 1 year or until dismissed
You win over the target’s mind, causing it to see you as a close
and trusted friend and look upon your every suggestion as
reasonable. The target is helpful toward you, so it will go out of
its way to help you. As with any other helpful creature, there are
limits to what you can ask of it. If you ever ask the target to do
something completely against its nature or needlessly harmful to
the target or its interests, not only does it refuse, but it also can
attempt a Will save to end the effect early. Because of the casting
time and range, it’s generally difficult to cast this ritual unless
the target is willing (perhaps convinced the ritual will have some
other effect) or restrained. If the creature is unwilling to accept
the ritual, it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect.
Critical Success The ritual succeeds and the target takes a –4
status penalty to Will saves to end the effect.
Success The ritual succeeds.
Failure The ritual fails.
Critical Failure The ritual fails and the target instead hates you,
becoming hostile to you for the duration.
Heightened (6th) You can use inveigle on a creature up to 1 mile
away throughout the casting, as long as you have a piece of
the creature’s body, which you mix into the oils used in the
cost. The base cost is 100 gp. The duration is shorter, and
based on how large a piece of the creature’s body you use:
1 week for blood, hair, scales, and the like, or 1 month for a
hand or similarly substantial body part.

## Phantasmal Custodians Ritual 3


## Uncommon

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils, salts, and herbs worth a total value of
15 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (expert); Secondary Checks
Arcana or Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the primary
check), Diplomacy
Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 20 feet high
Duration 1 year
You create a long-lasting adaptation of the phantasmal minion
spell, forming entities to carry out basic tasks at a fixed location.
Critical Success The ritual creates six phantasmal minions (Player
Core 349). You don’t need to concentrate on them, and they
aren’t summoned minions. You can spend an action, which has
the concentrate trait, to command one to perform a basic task;
it continues to perform the task until commanded again.
Success As critical success, but the ritual creates three minions.
Failure The ritual fails to create any phantasmal minions.
Critical Failure The ritual creates six phantasmal minions, but
these creatures are hostile and capable of making fist Strikes
with an attack bonus equal to your skill modifier for the

primary skill check, dealing 1d6 force damage. They attack
you and your allies and attempt to break objects belonging to
you and your allies within the area.
Heightened (6th) If destroyed, the phantasmal minions reform
the next morning. The cost increases to 30 gp.

## Reincarnate Ritual 3


## Uncommon

Cast 4 hours; Cost rare herbs worth a total value of the target’s
level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Nature (expert); Secondary Checks Occultism,
Religion
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 8th level
You call forth the target’s soul and attempt to incarnate it into a
brand-new body. As the soul won’t be returning to the original
body, only a small portion of the creature’s remains are required.
These remains must have been part of the original body at the
time of death, and the target must have died within the past
week. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has come
or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, this ritual
automatically fails, but you discover this after you succeed at the
Religion check and can end the ritual without paying the cost.
If the ritual is successful, the target’s new body has a random
ancestry. Roll 1d20. On a result of 1 through 14, the new body
is one of a common ancestry, while on a 15 through 20 they
become a member of an uncommon or rare ancestry. The GM
chooses possible ancestries based on those found in the region
and randomly determines the ancestry. For instance, the GM
could roll 1d8 to choose a common ancestry from Player Core. The
target replaces their ancestry Hit Points, size, Speeds, attribute
boosts and flaws, traits, and special abilities with those of their
new ancestry. The target loses their heritage and ancestry feats,
selecting replacements from their new ancestry. The target’s
background, class features, and languages remain unaltered.
Critical Success You reincarnate the target into a new adult
body. This new body has full HP and has the same spells
prepared as the original did when it died.
Success As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and
no spells prepared. The soul takes some time to adjust to their
new body, leaving them clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2
for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by
any means until the week has passed.
Failure You fail to reincarnate the target.
Critical Failure The target’s soul becomes trapped in an
unintelligent animal creature of the GM’s choosing, with a
level no greater than half the target’s level. While trapped,
the target has an Intelligence score of 1 (–5 modifier) and can’t
use any of their own abilities.
Heightened (4th) The maximum level of the target increases to
10. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 40 gp.
Heightened (5th) The maximum level of the target increases to
12. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 75 gp.

## Heartbond

Heightened (6th) The maximum level of the target increases to
14. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 125 gp. The
target must have died within the past month.
Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases to
16. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 200 gp. The
target must have died within the past month.
Heightened (8th) The maximum level of the target increases to
18. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 300 gp. The
target must have died within the past year.
Heightened (9th) The maximum level of the target increases to
20. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 600 gp. The
target must have died within the past decade.

## Rest Eternal Ritual 4


## Uncommon Spirit

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils to anoint the body worth a total value
of the target’s level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Religion (expert); Secondary Checks Occultism,
Religion
Range 20 feet; Targets 1 dead creature
You call upon gods, spirits, and stranger beings to bar a
creature’s spirit from ever returning. A spirit that doesn’t wish to
be so constrained can attempt a Will save to resist this ritual; on
a critical success, it fools you into believing the ritual succeeded.
This ritual has no effect on a target who is undead or whose soul
is otherwise not in the afterlife.
Critical Success You sequester the subject’s spirit to the
afterlife. Attempts to communicate with the dead creature,
return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb
its afterlife fail unless the effect’s counteract rank is at least 2
higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact
or a deity. Successfully returning the creature to life ends the
restrictions placed by rest eternal.
Success As critical success, but effects to interact with the spirit
fail unless the effect’s counteract rank is higher than that of
rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The ritual fails, and the spirits you appealed to
are angered. All casters become doomed 1 for 1 week.

## Shadow Double Ritual 4


## Rare Illusion

Cast 1 day; Cost a small item of personal significance to the
creature to be duplicated (such as an item of clothing they
wear everyday or a memento of a romantic tryst), plus rare
oils, minerals, and pigments with a total value of 300 gp;
Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master, the check has the
secret trait); Secondary Checks Arcana, Nature, Occultism,
Religion, or Society (whichever is required to Recall Knowledge
about the creature being duplicated); Crafting; Deception
Targets 1 living creature
You create an illusory duplicate of the target creature by drawing
shadowy material from the Netherworld and sculpting it into a
semi-solid form. The shadow double is a 4th-level creature with
no special abilities. If it needs to attempt a roll or use a DC, use
the moderate number for a monster (GM Core 113), except as
noted below. It doesn’t have any specific memories from the
target, but it can use information about the creature gained from
any of the casters to Impersonate the target. It looks exactly
like the target and has a Deception modifier to Impersonate that
creature equal to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who
rolled the Deception check, with a +4 status bonus.
Though it doesn’t have any of the original’s special abilities,
like a dragon’s breath, illusions allow it to appear to use those
abilities; they just never seem to have an effect. For instance,
against a double’s dragon’s breath, all creatures in the area seem
to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no damage.
Creatures can attempt to disbelieve the illusion by attempting
a Perception check against the Deception DC of the secondary
spellcaster who rolled the Deception check.
Critical Success You create the shadow double. It has the minion
trait and is under your absolute control. You gain a direct
mental link with the shadow double and can spend an action to
command the shadow double via this link, even at a distance.
Success As a critical success, but there is no special link between
you and the shadow double. You must spend an action to
command it verbally or by some other means.
Failure The ritual fails and has no effect.
Critical Failure The shadow double is created, but it isn’t your
minion and is hostile to all the casters. It does everything it
can to destroy them, but if it can’t immediately slay them, the
shadow double tries to escape and plots their demise.

## Teleportation Circle Ritual 7


## Uncommon Teleportation

Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense, precious metals, and purified chalk
worth 500 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary Checks
Crafting, Survival
Range 20 feet
Duration 1 day
You create a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground, which acts
as a portal to a destination determined at the time of the ritual.
You designate the destination of the teleportation as part of the
ritual. This destination can’t be changed. The destination must
be a location within 1,000 miles and be on the same plane as
the teleportation circle. You must be able to identify the location
precisely both by its position relative to the location where
you create the teleportation circle and by the destination’s
appearance (or other identifying features). The destination must
also be a 10-foot-diameter circle that doesn’t overlap with any
solid structures, but it can be a place that is harmful or dangerous.
A secondary caster attempting a Survival check for this ritual
can be located at the destination, instead of at the point of origin.
If the secondary caster succeeds at their check at the destination
and you roll a success, the ritual is a critical success instead.
While the circle is active, any creature that moves to be fully
within the circle is instantly teleported to the destination. A
creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will
save to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature
must attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns.

The circle normally works only in one direction, though you
can double the Cost to make it work in both directions.
Critical Success You create the teleportation circle, and it’s
extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled.
Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point.
Success As a critical success, but the destination is off target by
roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum of
10 miles off target.
Failure The teleportation circle doesn’t function.
Critical Failure The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate. It
leads to a random destination roughly the same distance
from the origin point, and the chances of some other unusual
mishap are much greater.
Heightened (9th) The cost is 2,000 gp, the duration is 1 month,
and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet.
Heightened (10th) The cost is 10,000 gp, the duration is unlimited,
and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet.

## Ward Domain Ritual 6


## Uncommon

Cast 1 day; Cost rare incenses, oils, and powdered silver, worth
150 gp total; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana, Nature, or Occultism (master); Secondary
Checks Lore (any), Survival, Thievery
Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 50 feet high
Duration 1 week
This ritual has long been used to guard the private sanctums of
powerful rulers, spellcasters, and other figures of import. You
and the other casters spend the casting time burning incense,
anointing doorframes, and drawing lines of powered silver
across entryways. The ritual creates the following magical
effects within the area; these effects are heightened to the rank
of ward domain and remain throughout the duration.
All gates, doors, windows, and similar apertures in the area
(if any) are locked, with the effects of lock. In addition, you can
obscure up to six doors, doorways, or similar entrances within
the area with the effects of illusory object to appear as plain
walls. Scrying spells can’t perceive any stimuli from the area,
and ward domain attempts to counteract teleportation effects
into or out of the area, including attempts to summon creatures
into the area, using a modifier equal to the ritual’s save DC – 10.
A successful dispel magic used on a specific effect removes
only that effect (such as the lock effect on one window). A
successful detonate magic ends the entire ritual.
Critical Success You create the effects described above, and you
protect an area twice as large.
Success You create the effects described above.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The area becomes trapped and hostile to you
and your allies in a way you didn’t anticipate.
Heightened (+1) The ward covers an additional area 100 feet ×
100 feet, up to 50 feet high, contiguous with the original area.

## Phantasmal Custodians


The investigator’s trusty detective tools, a swashbuckler’s flashy dueling cape, and a
champion’s shining armor are nearly as iconic as the characters who use them. For any
hero, the gear and treasure they wield and collect throughout their adventures can play
as important a role as any other facet of their character, from weapons steeped in cultural
history to fantastic treasures of unparalleled worth!

## Chapter 6:


## Treasure Trove

This chapter presents a variety of brand-new equipment
and treasure that expands on and supplements the
options provided in Chapter 6: Equipment of Player
Core and Chapter 5: Treasure Trove of GM Core. In
particular, the gear that follows is especially suitable for
the new ancestries and classes presented in this book,
but this multitude of new items can enhance and enrich
all types of characters. Rules for activating and investing
items, as well as a guide for reading an item’s stat block,
begin on page 219 of GM Core.
weapons & materials
Information on new weapons and a rare special material
begins on page 276. This section includes class kits for
the new classes presented in this book, so you can quickly
equip a new character with the armor, weapons, and
gear they’ll need to start adventuring! The full rules for
weapons and adventuring gear appear in Chapter 6 of
Player Core. This section also contains the new precious
material dragonhide.
Armor & Armaments
This section has a new assortment of new magic armor,
shields, and weapons that are all specific items. If you want
to create such an item with only abilities from runes, use
those found in GM Core.
Alchemical Items
Alchemical items are consumable, non-magical items
that rely on the properties of volatile alchemical reagents
to produce their effects. Alchemical items also appear
starting on page 244 of GM Core, but this book contains
all those items and more, particularly for the use of the
alchemist class. The alchemical items in this book are
presented by level in the Alchemical Items by Level Table
on pages 281–282 as a reference for alchemists and other
characters with alchemical abilities.
Snares
Snares are small, simple traps to damage or hamper
your foes that you can create and deploy quickly
enough to utilize on a battlefield. Snares are nonmagical
consumable items. This section includes
the full rules for creating and using snares. The Snare
Crafting feat (page 234) and snarecrafter archetype (page
216) are the primary ways to gain snares.
Momentary Magic
The items in this section are consumables. An item with
the consumable trait can be used only once and is then
destroyed. Here you’ll find new ammunition, oils, potions,
talismans, and wondrous consumables.
Trappings of Power
The permanent items found here are typically held in the
hands or worn on the body. These include new held items,
staves, a variety of specific magic wands, and worn items.
Treasure Table
The Treasure Table on pages 312–314 presents all the new
items appearing in this book, organized by level and item
category to help you find the appropriate gear for your
character or adventure. The tables are divided by level,
split into consumables or permanents, and then organized
by item categories within each table.

273

Weapons
From tripkee clubs to catfolk blades to tengu slings,
many of the weapons presented here are often used by
particular societies.
New Weapon Traits
The weapons in this section use the following new traits, in
addition to those found on pages 282–283 of Player Core.
Hampering: A weapon with the hampering trait includes
a disruptive limb or flange. After you hit with the weapon,
you can use an Interact action to give the target a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all Speeds. The penalty ends after
the target takes a move action, at the start of your next
turn, if you attack with the weapon, or if you move out of
reach of the target, whichever comes first.
Modular: The weapon has multiple configurations that
you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically,
switching between configurations of a modular weapon
allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the
trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s possible for
a modular weapon’s description to list more complicated
configurations.
Razing: This weapon is particularly good at damaging
objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal
damage to an object (including shields and animated
objects), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the
object takes an amount of additional damage equal to
double the number of weapon damage dice.
Tethered: This weapon is attached to a length of rope
or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your
hand. If you have a free hand (including if you’ve just
thrown a two-handed tethered weapon and have a hand
holding nothing but the weapon’s tether), you can use an
Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp
after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has
been disarmed (unless it’s being held by another creature).
Weapon Descriptions
Each of the weapons listed in the weapon tables on page
275 are described below.
Adze: A common cutting tool, an adze resembles an
axe—but the cutting edge is horizontal, rather than vertical.
The adze’s shape makes it popular among woodworkers,
and tripkee builders often use them to construct their
treetop homes. The tool also serves as an effective weapon,
due in part to the immense strength required to swing it.
Breaching Pike: Forged with a heavy metal wedge
effective at damaging enemy shields, breaching pikes are
often used by hobgoblin infantry alongside a tower shield.
Capturing Spetum: Hobgoblins use these polearms both
as standard issue for aggressive military units and on an
individual basis for hunting fugitives.
Claw Blade: This handheld weapon’s three parallel
blades extend between the fingers to resemble the natural
claws of the amurruns who created them, providing a way
for those catfolk without suitable natural claws to share
the fighting customs of their kin.
Cruuk: This specialized club is designed for throwing
and useful in both combat and hunting. Tripkees use them
to take down creatures that hide high in treetops.
Daikyu: This asymmetrical bow, made of laminated
bamboo, wood, and leather, stands 6 feet or more in height.
It’s most often used while mounted.
Fangwire: This kobold wire is thin and hard to see,
making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder flicks one
handle around a vulnerable spot so that it serves as a catch
for the wire, then yanks the other handle back, pulling the
wire tight and inflicting painful lacerations. The function
and name come from a wire-based trap called a “slow fang.”
Hand Adze: The adze’s smaller version is useful for
delicate woodworking in cramped spaces. Tripkees use hand
adzes for crafting and as close quarters weapons.
Khopesh: This curved sickle sword has a pointed tip,
allowing it to be swung in wide arcs or thrust vertically
around enemy defenses. The tip of a khopesh is hooked
and can be used to trip an opponent.
Mambele: Also known as a hunga munga or danisco,
this knife-axe hybrid consists of a hilt and blade that curves
backward toward the wielder. The blade’s curve is such
that, after a mambele has struck a victim, more damage
is dealt as the weapon is extracted from the victim’s body.
Flying Talon: This weapon consists of a three-pronged
barbed hook attached to a length of chain. It can be used
in melee to stab foes or hurled at a range. Some kobolds are
particularly fond of using flying talons, especially as a sort
of badge of office above those who serve them.
Spirit Thresher: Bones, some solid and others splintered,
are affixed to metal chains at the end of a long stick to form
a powerful flail. Many kholo warriors insist the vicious
crack the weapon makes as it strikes loosens fragments of
the soul like husks struck from grains.
Tengu Gale Blade: This fan-shaped sword designed by
tengu smiths has five broad blades that join at its hilt. Tengu
sailors use them as makeshift weather vanes, for the sword
spins in the wind’s direction when loosely held aloft.
Thunder Sling: Tengu use these specialized slings to fire
darts further and with greater force than when thrown by
hand. A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also
The following weapons and new dragonhide material are of particular interest to members
of ancestries and classes introduced in this book.

## Weapons & Materials


hurl blowgun darts as ammunition but deals 1d4 piercing
damage instead of 1d6 when used this way.
Tricky Pick: This ingenious kobold pick conceals
several hidden traps that the wielder can activate to trick
and befuddle foes with a variety of damaging blades and
bludgeoning surfaces.
Whip Claw: The whip claw is a long tether affixed to
claw-like daggers, allowing the wielder to fling and retract
them with deadly precision. Catfolk first developed
this weapon to provide extended reach when hunting
dangerous animals, and they wield them with unmatched
expertise.

Precious Materials
Materials with the precious trait can be substituted for base
materials. Items made of a precious material cost more than
typical items; not only does precious material cost more,
but the crafter must invest more time working with it. In
addition, more powerful items require precious materials
of greater purity. Many precious materials and the process
for crafting with them are described starting on page 252
of GM Core. A new precious material, dragonhide, is
described below. The Price entry gives the price of a simple
non-magical item made of that material, based on its Bulk
(if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk, use the price for 1 Bulk) as
well as prices for different amounts of the material. Armor
and shields made of dragonhide are included here.

## Dragonhide Material 8+


## Uncommon Precious

The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item
normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies
in color and texture, depending on the dragon it came from.
Due to dragonhide’s resiliency, it can also be used to Craft
armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate,
half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made
without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage
type, depending on the tradition associated with the dragon
(see the table below).
Type standard-grade dragonhide object; Level 8; Price 350 gp
per Bulk
Type high-grade dragonhide object; Level 16; Price 6,000 gp
per Bulk
Precious Material Armor
You can make leather, hide, or any armor usually made
out of plates (such as breastplate, half plate, and full
plate) from dragonhide. Because armor’s Bulk is reduced
when the armor is worn, use its carried Bulk when
determining its material Price.

## Dragonhide Armor Item 12+


## Uncommon

Usage worn armor; Bulk varies by armor
Dragonhide armor is immune to one damage type based on
the type of dragon it’s made from (as listed in the table
below). Wearing armor made from dragonhide also grants
you a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC and saving throws
against attacks and spells that deal the corresponding
damage type.
Type standard-grade dragonhide armor; Level 12; Price 1,600

Armor
These suits of armor have abilities far different from
what can be gained by etching runes. A specific magic
armor lists its fundamental runes, which you can
upgrade, add, or transfer as normal. You can’t etch or
transfer any property runes onto a specific armor that it
doesn’t already have or remove its property runes.

## Dragonplate Item 16


## Uncommon Invested Magical

Price 10,000 gp
Usage worn armor; Bulk 4
This suit of +2 greater resilient dragonhide (page 276) full plate
makes you look like a fearsome dragon. The armor comes in
many different varieties depending on the type of dragon
from which it’s made, though they usually conform to the four
magical traditions.
Activate—Dragon Breath [two-actions] (manipulate) Frequency once
per day; Effect You unleash a 15-foot cone of energy with
a damage type and saving throw corresponding to the
tradition of the dragon used to make the armor (shown on
the table below). The cone deals 14d6 damage; each creature
in the area must attempt a DC 36 basic saving throw.
Craft Requirements The initial raw materials must include
1,250 gp of dragonhide.

Usage worn armor; Bulk 2
Stitched together from pieces of ghoul skin, this suit of +1 hide
armor grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against
curses and makes you immune to the stench of ghouls. Ghoul
hide with a resilient rune increases the resilient rune’s item
bonus to saving throws against curses by 1 (maximum +4).

warships who want as much protection as possible but still need

CHALICE OF JUSTICE ITEM 14

## Uncommon Divine Holy

Price 4,500 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This gleaming golden sword is a +2 greater striking holy cold
iron longsword given only to the worthiest heroes of a holy
faith. It’s made of a sacred, secret alloy that makes the blade
both cold iron and silver. If you’re unholy, you’re drained 2
while holding a chalice of justice. You can’t recover from this
condition while holding the weapon.
Activate—Sip of Justice [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per
day; Effect The pommel of the weapon transmutes into
the shape of a miniature chalice. You drink deep from the
chalice and regain HP equal to the chalice’s level. If you’re
holy, you regain double the HP, and for 1 minute, whenever
you critically hit an unholy creature with the chalice of
justice, the creature takes 2d6 persistent spirit damage, and
it’s slowed 1 for 1 round. The persistent spirit damage has
the holy trait.
Craft Requirements You’re holy.

## Four-Ways Dogslicer Item 12

### Uncommon Cold Electricity Fire Magical
Price 1,700 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This +2 striking dogslicer is obviously the work of a brilliant
but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over safety. Four
toothy gems line the blade’s cutting edge, three of which
glow—one with fiery red light, one with a chill blue, and one
that gives off sparks—while the last is a glistening black. Each
of these gems embodies a weapon property rune, but only one
rune can be active at a time.
Activate—Gem Twist [one-action] (manipulate) Effect You twist the gem
along the blade corresponding with the desired weapon
property rune: red for flaming, blue for frost, or yellow for
shock. You take 1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune
deals. You can instead twist the black gem to disable the
active property rune, taking no damage.

## Infiltrator’S Accessory Item 5


## Illusion Magical

Price 150 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This elegant +1 striking sword cane serves equally well as both
a fashionable accessory and a hidden weapon suitable for
high-society events where weapons aren’t typically permitted.
Activate—Hide Magic [one-action] (manipulate) Effect You twist the
sword cane’s hilt, magically merging the blade into the
cane. While the blade is merged, it can’t be drawn and
gains the benefits of a 3rd-rank disguise magic spell to
appear non-magical. Passive observers can’t attempt a
check to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane,
if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining it
can discern the cane is more than it appears, but doing
so is extremely difficult (DC 30 Perception). Activating
the sword cane again releases the blade, allowing it to be
drawn normally.

## Spellguard Blade Item 7


## Magical

Price 320 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
The guard of this +1 striking main-gauche is inscribed with
eldritch glyphs that guard against magic. When you’re
benefiting from the circumstance bonus to AC from this
weapon’s parry trait, you also apply that circumstance bonus
to your saving throws against spells that target you.

## Spiritsight Crossbow Item 8


## Uncommon Magical

Price 450 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This +1 striking ghost touch crossbow has an array of
crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels
strangely light.
Activate—Ethereal Vision [one-action] (concentrate) Frequency once per
minute; Effect You aim through the crossbow’s crystalline
lenses, gaining imprecise vision onto the Ethereal Plane
with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses
until the end of your turn. You can sense through objects in
the Universe this way, and the sense is precise for detecting
creatures. Because this sense detects spiritual energy, a
creature that’s immune to spirit can’t be detected in this way.
Activate—Ethereal Shot [one-action] Requirements Ethereal Vision is
active; Effect You Strike with the spiritsight crossbow. This
shot travels through the Ethereal Plane, allowing it to pass
through and ignore cover from physical objects within the
range of your Ethereal Vision.

Sometimes the reactions of alchemical reagents create
effects that seem magical, and at other times, they straddle
the line between purely reactive and the inexplicable.
Alchemists explore the secrets of these reagents, learning
how to blend their essence with these special chemicals
to efficiently create short-lived alchemical items at no
monetary cost. Even in these cases, alchemical items
don’t radiate magic auras, instead using the alchemist’s
infused essence as one additional catalyst for the item’s
alchemical effects.
Rules for creating alchemical items are found in the
Craft activity (Player Core 236), and you must have the
Alchemical Crafting skill feat to use Crafting to create
alchemical items. Critically failing a Crafting check to
make alchemical items often causes a dangerous effect,
such as an explosion for a bomb or accidental exposure
for a poison, in addition to losing some of the materials.
Some alchemical items have additional requirements
beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these items list
their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry.
All alchemical items have the alchemical trait. Most
also have the consumable trait, which means that the
item is used up once activated. The bomb, elixir, mutagen,
and poison traits indicate special categories of alchemical
items, each of which is described on the following pages.
Alchemical items without any of these traits are called
alchemical tools and are described further on page 295.

Alchemical items aren’t magical. They instead use the properties of volatile chemicals,
exotic minerals, potent plants, and other substances, collectively referred to as alchemical
reagents. As such, alchemical items don’t radiate magical auras, and they can’t be dismissed
or affected by dispel magic. Their effects last for a set amount of time or until they’re
countered in some way, typically physically.

Alchemical Bombs
An alchemical bomb combines volatile components that
explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most
alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce
other effects. Bombs have the bomb trait.
Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range
increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you make
a weapon attack roll against the target’s AC, as you would
for any other weapon. It takes one hand to draw, prepare,
and throw a bomb. The bomb is activated when thrown
as a Strike—you don’t have to activate it separately. As
consumables, bombs can’t have runes etched onto them,
have talismans attached to them, or benefit from runes
granted in other ways (such as from spells or from items
that replicate runes from other items). Spells and magic
items that give you a bonus to all your attacks (or to all
thrown weapons, for example) can still apply to them.
Splash Trait
Some weapons and effects, such as alchemical bombs,
have the splash trait. When you use a weapon or effect
with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength
modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon or effect
deals any listed splash damage to the target on a failure,
success, or critical success and to all other creatures
within 5 feet of the target on a success or critical success.
On a critical failure, the weapon or effect misses entirely,
dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with
the initial damage against the target before applying
the target’s resistance or weakness. You don’t multiply
splash damage on a critical hit.
For example, if you throw a lesser acid flask and hit
your target, that creature takes 1 acid damage, 1d6
persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage. All
other creatures within 5 feet of it take 1 acid splash
damage. On a critical hit, the target takes 2 acid damage
and 2d6 persistent acid damage, but the splash damage
is still 1. If you miss, the target takes only 1 splash
damage. If you critically fail, no one takes any damage.

Alchemical Poisons
Alchemical poisons are potent toxins distilled or extracted
from natural sources. Each poison’s stat block includes
the price and features for a single dose. Poison doses are
typically kept in a vial or some other secure container.
Applying alchemical poisons uses manipulate actions. A
poison typically requires one hand to pour into food or
scatter in the air. Applying a poison to a weapon or another
item requires two hands, with one hand holding the
weapon or item. The Usage entry for a poison indicates the
number of hands needed for a typical means of application,
but the GM might determine that using poisons in other
ways functions differently. Weapons and items can have
only one poison applied to them at a time, even if those
poisons have different methods of exposure. If a second
poison is applied to an item, the lower-level poison is
removed (chosen randomly if both are the same level).
The full rules for how poisons and other afflictions
work are on page 430 of Player Core. A creature
attempts the listed saving throw as soon as it’s exposed
to the poison; on a failed save, the creature advances to
Stage 1 of the poison after any listed onset time elapses.
Virulent Poisons: Some poisons have the virulent trait.
You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a
virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical success reduces
a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2.
Method of Exposure
Each alchemical poison has one of the following traits,
which define how a creature can be exposed to that poison.
Contact: A contact poison is activated by applying it to
an item or directly onto a living creature’s skin. The first
creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving
throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly,
the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately
when the poison touches its skin. Contact poisons are
infeasible to apply to a creature via a weapon attack due to
the logistics of delivering them without poisoning yourself.
Typically, the onset time of a contact poison is 1 minute.
Ingested: An ingested poison is activated by applying
it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature,
or by placing it directly into a living creature’s mouth. A
creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison
when it consumes the poison, or the food or drink treated
with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons
typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day.
Inhaled: An inhaled poison is activated by unleashing
it from its container. Once unleashed, the poison creates a
cloud filling a 10-foot cube lasting for 1 minute or until a
strong wind dissipates it. Every creature entering this cloud
is exposed to the poison and must attempt a saving throw
against it; a creature aware of the poison before entering
the cloud can use a single action to hold its breath and gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw for 1 round.
Injury: An injury poison is activated by applying it to
a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the
first Strike made using the poisoned item. If that Strike is
a success and deals piercing or slashing damage, the target
must attempt a saving throw against the poison. On a failed
Strike, the target is unaffected, but the poison remains on
the weapon and you can try again. On a critical failure, or if
the Strike fails to deal slashing or piercing damage for some
other reason, the poison is spent, but the target is unaffected.

## Alchemical Consumable

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
Originally formulated as a means of dissolving everlasting
adhesive, this powerful solvent can break almost any adhesive’s
grip. As absolute solvent is particularly effective against

depending on the type.

## Everlasting Adhesive Item 7


## Alchemical Consumable

Price 55 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate 1 minute (manipulate)
This peculiar amber adhesive bonds two surfaces together
almost inseparably. A single flask covers an area up to 1 square
foot and must be used all at once to form a single bond between
two surfaces. If the activation is interrupted, the bond fails, and
the adhesive is wasted.
Once two surfaces are joined with everlasting adhesive, a
creature can separate them only with a successful DC 50 Athletics
check. The adhered objects tend to break before the adhesive does
unless they’re particularly durable, though a creature determined
to separate the objects can break off the parts connected by the
everlasting adhesive and later Repair the objects.
The adhesive can affect creatures only if they’re willing, and
its bond can be broken by exfoliating the outermost layer of skin.

## Forensic Dye Item 1


## Alchemical Consumable

Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
Activating this vial of colorless liquid requires inserting a small
amount of another chemical or material, such as blood or mud.
The vial reacts rapidly, transforming into a murky, reddish-brown
substance for a brief moment before turning clear once more.
Once activated, the dye remains potent for up to 10 minutes,
during which time you can spend 1 minute to brush it onto a
single object of up to 1 Bulk or across the ground in a single 5-foot
square. Where the dye comes in contact with an exact match for
the activating chemical, it takes on a bright blue hue while staying
transparent in areas with no activating component present.

## Ghost Ink Item 1


## Alchemical Consumable

Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate 10 minutes (manipulate)
This pale-blue ink dries rapidly, becoming fully transparent 1
minute after application. The ink glows red when exposed to
heat, such as that from a torch or other open flame. This glow
lasts only as long as the ink is exposed to heat, after which the
ink becomes invisible again. The crafter of the ghost ink can
alter the formula slightly to instead make the ink sensitive to
sunlight, starlight, magical light, or heatless light created by an
alchemical effect, such as a glow rod.
While the text isn’t glowing, a creature closely examining a
surface marked with ghost ink can detect the presence of the
ink with a successful DC 25 Perception check. On a critical
success, they can make out the ink well enough to use Society
to Decipher Writing. One vial of ghost ink is sufficient to write
a page worth of text.

## Glow Rod Item 1


## Alchemical Consumable Light

Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)

## Alchemical Consumable Fire

Price 2 sp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
An alchemical substance applied to one end of this tiny wooden
stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a
flame with a matchstick is much faster than creating a flame
with flint and steel. You can ignite it and touch it to a flammable
object as part of the same Interact action. A matchstick remains
lit for 1 round, after which it’s consumed and extinguished.

## Philosopher’S Stone Item 20


## Uncommon Alchemical Consumable

Price —
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
Activate [one-action] (manipulate) or 1 or more days; see below
An alchemist with the Craft Philosopher’s Stone feat adds the
formula for this item to their formula book. This allows them
to create a philosopher’s stone once per month during their
daily preparations using advanced alchemy. Unlike other items
created with advanced alchemy, the philosopher’s stone remains
potent for 1 month or until the alchemist creates a new one. This
is the only way to create a philosopher’s stone.

295

At a glance, a philosopher’s stone appears to be an ordinary,
sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a
Force Open action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone’s heart.
The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can
transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir
of rejuvenation (page 288).
To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in Crafting and
have the Alchemical Crafting feat. You can then use the stone’s
quicksilver for one of two effects.
- You can apply the stone’s quicksilver to an infused true
elixir of life using an Interact action. This turns the elixir
into an infused elixir of rejuvenation instantaneously. This
doesn’t require any crafting time or additional materials.
- You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the
quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create
gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to Earn Income using
Crafting, except that you create 500 gp worth of your
chosen metal per day on a success or 750 gp worth per
day on a critical success.

## Silver Salve Item 2

material (such as cold iron) for any physical damage it deals.

symptom of an affliction or condition (such as sores from a
disease or discoloration from a poison). For the next hour,
the symptom disappears, and the wounded or afflicted
creature doesn’t feel as if it still has the wound or affliction,
though all effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse
by succeeding at a DC 17 Perception check, but only if it
uses a Seek action to specifically examine the snake oil’s
effects.

Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
You sprinkle these salts onto a single object up to 10 cubic
feet in volume and no more than 40 Bulk to preserve it for
1 week. The object doesn’t decay, and effects that require
the object to be fresh don’t count the time passing during
this duration as having elapsed. When sprinkled on a corpse,
this extends the period in which a creature can be revived
by magic as well as the wait time required before a corpse
can be targeted again with talking corpse. The salts prevent
ordinary pests from consuming the target (such as maggots
for a corpse or moths for a piece of clothing). Any creature
can use an Interact action to disperse the salts from an
unattended object and end this effect.


## Ghost Ink Philosopher’S Stone

Crafting Snares
A snare is built within a single 5-foot square. Only one
snare can occupy a single 5-foot square at a time. Once
constructed, it can’t be moved without destroying (and
often triggering) the snare. Snares usually last until they’re
triggered, though at the GM’s discretion, certain snares
might become inert after extended periods of time (such
as months or years). Snares made for quick deployment,
such as those from the Snarecrafter archetype, are less
durable and become inert after 24 hours.
You must have the Snare Crafting feat as well as be
wielding or wearing a snare toolkit (which is a type of
artisan’s toolkit, as found on page 287 of Player Core) to
create snares. You can spend 1 minute to Craft a snare by
expending an amount of money equal to the snare’s listed
Price. This expenditure represents the use of raw materials
that are included in your snare toolkit. If you want to
Craft a snare at a discount, you must spend downtime as
described in the Craft activity. Some snares have additional
requirements beyond those stated in the Craft activity;
these snares list their requirements in a Craft Requirements
entry. Despite having the consumable trait, you make only
one snare when you spend the minute to Craft a snare.
Detecting Snares
Creatures can detect snares they aren’t already aware of
as they would any trap or hazard (as described on page
98 of GM Core), using the creator’s Crafting DC as the
snare’s Stealth DC. If your proficiency rank is expert or
better in Crafting, only creatures actively searching can
find your snares.
Triggering Snares
Unless stated otherwise in a snare’s description, when a
Small or larger creature enters a snare’s square, the snare’s
effect occurs, and then the snare is destroyed.
Disabling Snares
Once a creature discovers a snare, it can disable it much
like it can other physical traps, using the Disable a Device
action of the Thievery skill and using the Crafting DC of
the snare’s creator as the DC. You can automatically disarm
a snare that you personally Crafted without triggering it by
taking an Interact action while adjacent to the snare.
Snares can’t be targeted by Strikes or other attacks
unless otherwise noted. At the GM’s discretion, a snare
might be triggered or destroyed by a particularly large
effect, such as a boulder rolling through the snare’s square,
or an area effect that specifically mentions unattended
objects, such as hydraulic torrent.

## Alarm Snare Snare 1

### Auditory Consumable Mechanical Snare Trap
Price 3 gp
You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy objects
to a trip wire or pressure plate. When you create an alarm

the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that it can be
heard by all creatures in the range you designated.

again repeatedly for 1 minute, forcing any creature that enters
the space or ends its turn in the space to take damage from the
spines (attempting the same basic Reflex save).

## Bomb Snare Snare 6


## Consumable Mechanical Snare Trap

Price 40 gp
You create a snare that causes three 3rd-level moderate
alchemical bombs of the same type to explode when a creature
triggers the snare. The target and all creatures in adjacent
squares must attempt a DC 24 Reflex save, as the snare deals
damage equal to three times the direct hit damage from one
of the component bombs (for example, 6d6 electricity damage
from three moderate bottled lightnings) with no splash
damage or other effects.
Snares are simple traps that can be created quickly with the Snare Crafting feat (page 234)
to injure or bedevil intruders. Unlike other items, found snares can’t be collected or sold in
their complete form. Snares have the snare trait.

visible from up to 2 miles away on a clear day or up to 5 miles
away on a clear night.
FLYING BLADE WHEEL SNARE SNARE 20

## Consumable Mechanical Snare Trap

When a creature enters the square, a deadly flying wheel of
spinning blades launches at it, making a Strike with an attack
modifier of +35 that deals 8d8 slashing damage on a hit.
Once on each of your turns, you can use an Interact action
within 120 feet of the wheel to cause it to Fly up to 60 feet
toward the creature it’s chasing and make another Strike if it’s
within 5 feet of its target after it moves. After 1 minute, the
spinning ceases, and the wheel falls to the ground. Creatures
can destroy the wheel to stop it (AC 37, Fort +29, Ref +20,
Hardness 10, HP 200, object immunities).

to interfere with a creature’s movement. The square with
this snare as well as three adjacent squares (to form a
10-foot-by-10-foot area) become difficult terrain when the
first creature enters the snare’s square. The difficult terrain

affects the creature’s movement right away, including its
movement into the triggering square, and it lasts for 1d4
rounds after the snare is triggered. A creature can use an
Interact action to clear the difficult terrain out of a single
square early.

slashing damage (DC 32 basic Reflex save).

## Signaling Snare Snare 1


## Consumable Mechanical Snare Trap

Price 3 gp
A subtle snare used in hunting or tracking, a signaling snare
often consists of carefully prepared earth, piled sand or stones,
specific arrangements of vegetation, and so forth. When a
creature enters a square of a signaling snare, nothing happens
to the creature, but instead it causes a small, unobtrusive
disruption to the terrain that allows the snare’s creator or
another creature who knows what to look for to determine
whether a creature of the appropriate size entered the square.
SNAGGING HOOK SNARE SNARE 10

## Consumable Mechanical Snare Trap

This snare snags a creature with its wicked metal hooks. The

enters the square of a stalker bane snare must attempt a DC

telltale footprints. Being invisible makes the target hidden,
rather than undetected, to creatures that could see it if it

Being invisible makes the target concealed, rather than
hidden or undetected, to creatures that could see it if it

Price 15 gp
You set a cunning wire to trip a creature. A Medium or
smaller creature that enters this snare’s square must attempt
a DC 21 Reflex save.
If you want to create a trip snare to trip a larger creature,
you must create a group of contiguous snares of a length
equal to the edge of that larger creature’s space, and the
creature must be moving such that it moves into the full set
of snares. For example, three trip snares in a 15-foot-line can
trip a Huge creature coming down a corridor into the line
of snares.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is off-guard until the start of its next
turn.
Failure The creature falls prone.

Ammunition
These magic items are ammunition for ranged weapons.
Each item’s stat block includes an Ammunition entry
that lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as,
or “any” if it’s not limited to any particular type. All stat
blocks for ammunition omit the Usage and Bulk entries;
use the standard rules in Chapter 6 of Player Core for
the type of ammunition to determine reloading times
and Bulk.
When using magic ammunition, use your ranged
weapon’s fundamental runes to determine the attack
modifier and damage dice. Don’t add the effects of your
weapon’s property runes unless the ammunition states
otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic
ammunition deals damage on a hit normally in addition
to any listed effects unless its description states otherwise.
Regardless of whether an attack with magic
ammunition hits or misses, launching the ammunition
consumes its magic. Magic ammunition is made
of normal materials, not precious materials, unless
stated otherwise.

## Antler Arrow Item 2


## Consumable Magical

Price 7 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
The creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter
with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain
an escaping foe. When an activated antler arrow hits a target,
glowing antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed
at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking
the critical specialization effects of a bow (Player Core 283).
If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you have
access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the
Athletics check increases to 15.

## Corrosive Ammunition Item 7


## Acid Consumable Magical

Price 70 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This peculiar ammunition is coated in yellow dust that leaves
a stain on anything it touches. When activated corrosive
ammunition hits a target, it dissolves across the target’s armor.
The armor takes 1d8 persistent acid damage that ignores the
armor’s Hardness; if the target isn’t wearing armor, it takes
the acid damage instead. This damage occurs at the end of the
target’s turns.
The creature can end this effect by spending an Interact
action to wipe off the corrosive dust. Otherwise, the effect
ends once the armor becomes broken.

## Disintegration Bolt Item 15


## Uncommon Consumable Magical

Price 1,300 gp
Ammunition bolt
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling
it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an
activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it’s subject to a
disintegrate spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with
the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target’s
saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of disintegrate.

## Freezing Ammunition Item 5


## Cold Consumable Magical

Price 25 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This chilly ammunition is dark blue and cold to the touch.
When activated freezing ammunition hits a target, the target
must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for
1 round by the intense cold (slowed 1 for 1 minute on a
critical failure).

## Slumber Arrow Item 3


## Consumable Magical Mental Sleep

Price 10 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
Sleep arrows often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their
fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated sleep
arrow deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it grows
lethargic and must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. On a
failure, it takes a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1
round, and is also slowed 1 for 1 round on a critical failure.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of sleep.

## Storm Arrow Item 9


## Air Consumable Electricity Magical

Price 130 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper.
When an activated storm arrow hits a target, it’s buffeted
by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals
This section contains magical items with the consumable trait, which might turn the tide of
battle but are destroyed after activation.

## Momentary Magic


301

3d12 electricity damage, and the target must attempt a DC
25 Reflex saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon
with a shock property rune, the save DC increases to 27,
though the attack doesn’t benefit from the shock property
rune itself.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage and isn’t affected by
the wind.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is buffeted by
winds for 1 round, taking a –2 circumstance penalty to
ranged attack rolls and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to
its fly Speed.

## Terrifying Ammunition Item 6

### Consumable Emotion Fear Magical Mental
Price 50 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult symbols
and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated terrifying ammunition
damages a creature, the creature’s mind is filled with visions
of its failures, its tragedies, and eventually, its own death. The
creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 1 and can’t reduce its
frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which
has the concentrate trait, to calm itself down.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is frightened 2.

## Viper Arrow Item 4


## Consumable Magical

Price 17 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its
iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an
activated viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into
a viper (Monster Core 316). The target is affected by the viper’s
venom, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in an open
space adjacent to the target.
The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of
your turn, even though you didn’t use the Sustain action. It’s
under the GM’s control, but it generally attacks the creature
the arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when
slain.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of summon animal.

## Disintegration Bolt


## Slumber Arrow


## Storm Arrow

Oils
Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that
are typically applied to an object and are used up in the
process. They have the oil trait. Applying an oil usually
takes two hands: one to hold the jar containing the oil,
and another to extract the oil and apply it. You can
only apply an oil to an item or creature within your
reach. Because the process is so thorough, it’s usually
impossible to apply an oil to an unwilling target or an
item in the possession of an unwilling target unless that
target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.
OIL OF DYNAMISM ITEM 8+

## Uncommon Consumable Magical Oil

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk —
Activate [two-actions] (manipulate)
This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully
spreading the oil over an object turns it into an animated object
(Monster Core 18–19) of the same type. For example, sprinkling
it on a statue makes an animated statue. If the animated
object’s level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to
animate it and ultimately fails.
This animated object has the minion trait, meaning it can use
2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for
the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains
animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can
have a maximum of four minions under your control.
Type oil of dynamism; Level 8; Price 85 gp
Type greater oil of dynamism; Level 16; Price 1,400 gp
You can animate an object with a level of 11 or lower.
OIL OF REVELATION ITEM 5

## Consumable Magical Oil

Price 25 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This bright oil, first created by humans as a tool to help them
fight in darkness, holds flecks of tiny gemstones in suspension
and smells like a struck matchstick.
The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a
creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the
creature is invisible, the light’s position means it’s merely
hidden to creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it,
rather than undetected. The light also negates the concealed
condition due to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon
doesn’t damage a creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off
and loses its power.

## Shielding Salve Item 1


## Consumable Magical Oil

Price 4 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This shimmering paste has many properties of a shield spell.
When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains
a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. The first time a
physical attack or a force barrage hits the target during that
round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and
then the oil’s effect ends.

## Tricky Liniment Item 5


## Consumable Magical Oil

Price 25 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This greenish, persistent grease can be applied to armor to
make it extremely slippery for 8 hours, granting the wearer a
+2 item bonus to Acrobatics checks to Escape or to Squeeze.

Potions
A potion is a magical liquid that’s activated when you
drink it, which uses it up. Potions have the potion trait. You
can activate a potion with an Interact action as you drink
it or feed it to another creature. You can feed a potion only
to a creature that’s within reach and willing or otherwise so
helpless that it can’t resist. You usually need only one hand
to consume a potion or feed it to another creature.
POTION OF DISGUISE ITEM 5+
### Uncommon Consumable Magical Polymorph Potion
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
Upon imbibing this potion, you take on the appearance of a
specific type of creature for 2d12 hours. The type of creature
is determined when the potion is created. For example, you
might have a potion of elf disguise or potion of frog disguise.
Drinking the potion doesn’t impart the knowledge of how long
the effect lasts; the GM rolls the duration in secret.
The disguise doesn’t change your traits or statistics, nor
does it give you any of the special abilities of the creature
you’re imitating. It might affect what items you can hold or
wear (for example, your new form might lack opposable
thumbs). The potion shrinks you down to a minimum of size
Small or maintains your size if the creature is your size or
larger. For example, if you are Medium and drink a potion of
fire giant disguise, you’ll take on the appearance of a fire giant
but remain Medium. The creature has to be of a specific kind,
such as “leopard” or “lion” rather than just “cat,” or “fire giant”
or “ogre” rather than just “giant,” but the potion can’t cause
you to mimic a specific individual creature.
The effects of this potion use the same rules as the Impersonate
activity of Deception. Onlookers always assume you’re the
chosen type of creature unless they’re actively Seeking. You gain
a +4 status bonus to your Deception DC against such Perception
checks and add your level even if untrained.
Type lesser; Level 5; Price 30 gp; Craft Requirements Initial
raw materials must include a bit of blood, hair, or flesh of
the creature the potion will allow the drinker to imitate.
Type moderate; Level 8; Price 100 gp; Craft Requirements
Initial raw materials must include a bit of blood, hair, or flesh
of the creature the potion will allow the drinker to imitate.
The moderate potion of disguise can increase your size if the
creature is larger than you, to a maximum of Large, and it can
shrink you to a creature of size Tiny. This doesn’t change any
of your statistics, with the exception of reducing your reach to
0 feet as a Tiny creature.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 300 gp
While drinking a greater potion of disguise, if you picture
the specific form you want to transform into, the potion will
change you into that form. You can attempt to Impersonate
a specific individual, though you still need to roll Deception.

with sacred light. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven pieces of straw.
When you activate the hunter’s bane, you sense the exact
location of the attacker. It becomes observed by you if it

## Iron Cudgel Item 14


## Consumable Magical Talisman

Price 900 gp
Usage affixed to a melee weapon; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This miniature club is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron
chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use Brutal Finish, as

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add an additional weapon
damage die on a success or a failure to the normal results.

## Flame Navette


## Hunter’S Bane


## Iron


## Equalizer


## Jade Bauble

Wondrous Consumables
Though many consumables are grouped into specific
categories, such as potions and talismans, some
consumables don’t fit into those categories.
CANDLE OF REVEALING ITEM 7

## Consumable Magical

Price 60 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
When lit, this black candle’s eerie blue flame reveals the
presence of invisible creatures. Within a 10-foot radius of the
lit candle, creatures don’t benefit from the invisible condition.
Their bodies are outlined, not fully visible, so they’re concealed.
Once lit, the candle burns for 1 minute, after which the effect
ends. If extinguished, it can’t be relit.
DUST OF CORPSE ANIMATION ITEM 8+

## Uncommon Consumable Magical

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk —
Activate [two-actions] (manipulate)
This black pouch contains what appears to be fine bone dust.
Pouring the dust in a special pattern over a corpse turns it into
an undead creature. The type of undead created depends on the
condition of the corpse, resulting in either a skeleton (Monster
Core 312) or a zombie (Monster Core 356). If the undead’s level
would be greater than 3, the dust fails to animate it. The body
must be of an appropriate size and type for the undead you
wish to create—for example, you must sprinkle the dust on a
horse’s skeleton to animate a skeletal horse. If more than one
undead in the level range is appropriate, such as skeletal guard
or skeletal champion for a Medium humanoid skeleton, you
choose.
The animated undead has the minion trait, meaning it can
use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command
for the current turn as part of the activation. The undead
creature remains animated for 1 minute before collapsing back
into its corpse form. You can have a maximum of four minions
under your control.
Type dust of corpse animation; Level 8; Price 100 gp
Type greater dust of corpse animation; Level 16; Price 1,500 gp
You can animate an undead with a level of 11 or lower.
INCENSE OF DISTILLED DEATH ITEM 12

## Consumable Magical Void

Price 350 gp
Usage held in 1 hands; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This black incense smells of fresh earth and ash. You activate
the incense by lighting it, whereupon it fills a 10-foot
emanation with oily smoke and potent void energy. Undead
creatures gain fast healing 4 while in the area; though this
healing comes from void energy, it doesn’t negatively impact
living creatures. Once lit, the incense burns for 1 minute, and it
can’t be extinguished.
TAPER OF SANCTIFICATION ITEM 13

## Uncommon Consumable Divine

Price 600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] (manipulate)
This thin golden candle bears the symbol of a specific deity
emblazoned on its surface, surrounded by the iconography of
that deity’s faith. A taper of sanctification must be dedicated
to a deity who can be sanctified to holy or unholy, and has
the corresponding trait. If the deity’s sanctification lists
both options, the crafter must choose one when the candle
is made.
Once lit, this candle burns for 1 hour, and it can’t be
extinguished. When a willing creature spends the full hour
within 10 feet of the lit candle engaging in prayer to the
deity, that creature’s Strikes gain the holy or unholy trait (as
appropriate for the candle) until the next time that creature
makes their daily preparations. During this time, the creature
is bound by the deity’s anathema. If they violate anathema,
they lose the benefit of the taper of sanctification. A holy
creature can’t benefit from an unholy taper of sanctification,
nor can an unholy creature benefit from a holy one.

### Candle Of Revealing Dust Of Corpse Animation
Held Items
CLOTH OF NULLIFICATION ITEM 20

## Rare Magical

Price 75,000 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This small piece of embroidered cloth is inimical to all magic.
Activate—Nullify Magic [two-actions] (manipulate) Effect You cover
a magic item with the cloth or wave the cloth near a magic
effect and attempt to counteract the effect or item. The cloth’s
counteract check modifier is +32, and its counteract rank is
10. Regardless of the result, the cloth of nullification can’t be
activated again for 2d6 hours. On a success, the effect or item
is deactivated for the same amount of time, and its duration,
if any, continues to expire during that time. With a successful
counteract check, you can instead choose to completely
absorb the magic from the effect or item into the cloth of
nullification. If you do, both become completely non-magical
and their magic can’t be recovered, even by the remake spell.
The cloth of nullification automatically fails to counteract
most artifacts and similarly powerful items.

## Earthsight Box Item 9


## Uncommon Magical Scrying

Price 575 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This fine wooden box is inlaid with Dwarven runes, with hinges
and a clasp of iron. The box contains handfuls of fine sand.
Activate—Replicate Earth 1 minute (concentrate, manipulate)
Frequency once per day; Effect You hold the box closed and,
while envisioning the terrain, turn the box clockwise three
times. When you open the box, the sand reveals, in miniature,
the stone terrain surrounding you, to a range of 60 feet. This
shows details of paths, hills, embankments, boulders, and even
artificial structures like walls and ditches, as long as they’re
made of stone and earth. If you’re underground, it reveals
tunnels and voids in the earth within 60 feet at your current
depth. The sand maintains its shape until you close the box.
PREDICTABLE SILVER PIECE ITEM 1

## Magical

Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This seemingly unremarkable, weathered silver coin bears the
bust of an unnamed monarch on the face and a majestic bird on
the tail. You can toss the coin without activating it, in which case
it follows the normal laws of probability.
Activate—Cheat Fate [one-action] (manipulate) Effect You rub your thumb
on one side of the coin with the intent of slightly tweaking
the strands of fate, then flip the coin into the air in a coin
toss. No matter how the toss is resolved—letting the coin fall
to the ground, slapping it down on the back of your hand, or
catching it on your open palm—it always lands with the side
you rubbed face up.

## Twisting Twine Item 3+


## Magical

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This ball of hempen twine resists efforts to unravel it by hand.
Activate—Unravel Twine [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per
day; Effect You toss the ball of twine into a square within
20 feet. The twine then unravels and animates, attempting to
Disarm or Trip (your choice) a creature in the square with a
total of +9 to the Athletics check. At the end of your turn, the
twine winds itself back into a ball and returns to your hand;
if you don’t have a free hand, it returns to your space instead.
Type lesser twisting twine; Level 3; Price 45 gp
Type moderate twisting twine; Level 5; Price 125 gp
You can activate the moderate twisting twine once per hour
instead of once per day, and the Athletics modifier is +12.

frequency limit, and the Athletics modifier is +15.
URN OF ASHES ITEM 9

## Magical Void

Price 700 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This pewter urn contains the ashes of a benevolent ancestor,
with a sliver of lingering spirit that strives to protect you.
Activate—Doom the Urn [reaction] (concentrate) Trigger You would
become doomed, or your doomed value would increase;
Requirements The ashes aren’t doomed; Effect The ashes in
the urn intervene, taking the doomed condition in your place,
and you don’t gain or increase the value of your doomed
condition. Each night when you get a full night’s rest, you
can reduce your own doomed condition or that of the urn,
but not both.
Activate—Spirit’s Wrath [one-action] (attack, concentrate, manipulate)
Frequency once per round; Effect The urn shoots a bolt of
void energy at a foe within 30 feet. Attempt a spell attack roll
against the target’s AC, using a modifier of +15 or your own
spell attack modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the
bolt deals 4d4 void damage (doubled on a critical success).
