## Tengu

You might...
- Be gregarious and eager to find a flock of your own.
- Voraciously absorb the practices of those around you,
sometimes even forgetting where they came from.
Others probably...
- Get confused by your simultaneous respect for and
disregard of tradition.
- Have trouble reading your expressions or regard
you with suspicion and superstition.
Physical Description
Tengu have many avian characteristics. Their faces are tipped
with sharp beaks and their scaled forearms and lower legs
end in talons. As closed footwear tends to fit poorly unless
custom made, many tengu wear open sandals or simply go
barefoot. Tengu are rarely more than 5 feet tall, and they
are even lighter than their smaller frames would suggest, as
they have hollow bones. A small number of tengu have
vestigial wings.
Society
The greatest divide in tengu society is between
tengu remaining in their ancestral home and those
who have dispersed across the world. Tengu refer to
these two groups as those “in the roost” and those
“migrating,” respectively. Roosted tengu tend to be
more traditionalist and conservative and are especially
concerned with preserving their culture in the face of
years of erosion from oppression. Migrating tengu, on
the other hand, voraciously absorb the culture of the
various nations and settlements that they now call home.
Roosted tengu tend toward more traditional names,
while migrating tengu readily absorb and repurpose the
culture of those around them.
Sample Names: Arkkak, Chuko, Dolgra, Dorodara,
Kakkariel, Kora, Marrak, Mossarah, Pularrka, Rarorel,
Ruk, Tak-Tak, Tsukotarra
Beliefs
Tengu often follow the faith of the region in which they
were raised, though the tengu ancestral deity is the storm
god Hei Feng. Before their diaspora, tengu practiced a
syncretic faith that blended a polytheistic worship of
the deities responsible for creating the natural world. As
tengu folklore posits that tengu long ago descended from
the night sky on shooting stars to rest upon Golarion’s
highest peaks, animist rites were practiced on mountains
and other great natural features.
Popular Edicts protect tengu traditions, adopt the lessons of
other cultures, seek out natural wonders
Popular Anathema lose control of your emotions

Tengu Heritages
As a fluid people scattered from their original homes, there are a wide variety
of tengu on Golarion. Choose one of the following tengu heritages at 1st level.
Dogtooth Tengu
In addition to a beak, your mouth also features a number of vicious, pointed
teeth. Some legends claim your powerful jaws can even bite through steel.
While you aren’t that strong yet, your fangs can still leave terrible wounds.
Your beak unarmed attack gains the deadly d8 trait.
Jinxed Tengu
Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now they slide off
your feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or
misfortune effect, you get a critical success instead. When you would gain
the doomed condition, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, reduce the
value of the doomed condition you would gain by 1.
Mountainkeeper Tengu
You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits
of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the vitality lash cantrip as
a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to
half your level rounded up. Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage
or ancestry feat, you can decide whether it’s a divine or primal spell.
Skyborn Tengu
Your bones may be especially light, you may be a rare tengu with wings,
or your connection to the spirits of wind and sky might be stronger than
most, slowing your descent through the air. You take no damage from falling,
regardless of the distance you fall.
Stormtossed Tengu
Whether due to a blessing from Hei Feng or hatching from your egg during
a squall, you are resistant to storms. You gain electricity resistance equal to
half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the flat check to
target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by rain or fog.
Taloned Tengu
Your talons are every bit as sharp and strong as your beak. You gain a talons
unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your talons are in the
brawling group and have the agile, finesse, unarmed, and versatile P traits.
Wavediver Tengu
You’re one of the rare tengu who can cut through water like a bird through
air, and you often lurk in rivers or oceans where few expect you. You gain a
swim Speed of 15 feet.

effect.

The triggering effect is disrupted. If it’s a misfortune effect,
Eat Fortune gains the fortune trait; if it’s a fortune effect, Eat

has red undertones, no matter the skin color of your human
form. Using Long-Nosed Form counts as creating a disguise
for the Impersonate use of Deception. Due to your imperfect
transformation, your transformation doesn’t automatically defeat
Perception DCs to determine whether you are human, though
you may be able to explain away or hide your tengu traits.
You lose your beak unarmed Strike in your human form, as

heritage or ancestry feat. You remain in your human form

Tripkees are a shy and cautious people who generally seek
to avoid being drawn into the affairs of others. Despite
their cautious outlook and small stature, adventurous
tripkees still take bold and noble action when the situation
demands it.
Tripkees are reclusive treetop survivalists who harvest
their homes’ bounty, utilizing their canopy homes as
natural fortifications against the threats posed by larger
predators. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools
has led to tripkees often being mischaracterized as
rudimentary, though this does poor justice to their skill
in the cultivation of hidden orchards and camouflaged
causeways tucked away in treetop nations. Tripkees are
most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade,
explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.
If you want a character who is small in stature but
large in spirit, and possesses qualities of a tree frog, you
should play a tripkee.
You might…
- Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment
when overcoming challenges.
- Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales
of exploitative strangers.
Others probably...
- Trust in your impartial, measured approach to
understanding situations and solving problems.
- Give you space, fearing that touching you would
prove toxic.
