## Ratfolk

Physical Description
Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless
tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or
black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs
around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however;
even a single family group can exhibit substantial
variation in hair color, eye color, or size.
Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though
this is also reinforced through their strong social
structures. Because their appearance is often considered
disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even
mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their
physical features with layers of clothing when moving
through spaces dominated by other ancestries.
Society
Ysoki culture values cooperation and community.
Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social
occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and
connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a
long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk
travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons
are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen
vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large
giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals.
Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have
been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes
with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are
often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids
they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and
endure them only when outside their communities.
Sample Names: Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto,
Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak,
Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess
Beliefs
Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract
concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be
chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but
they also obey strict social codes.
Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to
acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area,
Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother
Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to
ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own
interests above others. To most ratfolk,
Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those
things they need done, but which they
would not wish to do.
Popular Edicts put your community’s interests above your own,
maintain a cleanly appearance, be honest in your dealings

Ratfolk Heritages
Ratfolk are native to underground regions, but they are a highly adaptable
ancestry that has been found in almost every environment. Choose one of
the following ratfolk heritages at 1st level.
Deep Rat
Your ancestors lived deeper underground than other ratfolk, granting you
the ability to see in the dark. You gain darkvision.
Desert Rat
You are native to arid plains and likely grew up traveling the roads. If you
have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on
all fours. In addition, environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for
you, and you can go 10 times longer than normal before you are affected by
starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter,
environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
Longsnout Rat
Your long snout gives you a keener sense of smell than most ratfolk. You gain
imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense
of smell to determine a creature’s location, as explained on page 433 of the
Player Core. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from
the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to
Seek a creature or object within the range of your scent.
Sewer Rat
You come from a long line of ratfolk with a community based in the sewers
beneath a large settlement. You are immune to the disease putrid plague. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons.
If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get
a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve
the save in this way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you
roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.
Shadow Rat
Your ancestors lived in dark spaces underground, granting you dark fur and a
vaguely unnatural mien. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Intimidation
and can use Intimidation to Coerce animals. When you Demoralize an animal,
you don’t take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If you would
automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class,
for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice.
Animals’ attitudes toward you begin one degree worse than normal,
usually starting at unfriendly instead of indifferent for domesticated animals,
and hostile instead of unfriendly for wild animals.
Snow Rat
You have a thicker coat and bulkier frame to defend against the cold,
granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat
environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible
cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Tunnel Rat
You can easily compress your body and squeeze through gaps. You gain the Quick
Squeeze feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren’t trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces
not tight enough to require the Squeeze action aren’t difficult terrain for you.

Ratfolk Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th,
13th, and 17th levels). As a ratfolk, you select from among
the following ancestry feats.

## 1St Level


## Cheek Pouches Feat 1


## Ratfolk

Your cheeks are stretchy, and you can store up to four items of
light Bulk or less in these cheek pouches. None of these items
can have a dimension longer than 1 foot. As long as you have at
least one item in your cheek pouches, your speech is noticeably
difficult to understand. Placing an item in your cheek pouch or
retrieving one is an Interact action. You can empty your mouth
with a single action, causing everything you had stored in your
cheek pouches to fall to the ground in your square.

## Pack Rat Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You’ve learned how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You
can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane
storage containers or vehicles. For example, you can fit 6 Bulk
in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn’t alter the items’
Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or
extradimensional storage space, such as a spacious pouch.

## Rat Familiar Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You have a pet rat that has become magically bonded to you. You
gain a familiar using the rules on page 212 of the Player Core,
and this familiar must be a rat. It still gets the benefits of familiar
abilities, but its base form remains a rat.

## Ratfolk Lore Feat 1


## Ratfolk

Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made
you nimble, and you’ve learned to run and hide when enemies
threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics
and Stealth. If you would automatically become trained in one
of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Ratfolk Lore.

## Ratspeak Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the
Diplomacy skill with rodents, including beavers, mice, porcupines,
rats, and squirrels, but not with other mammals, such as dogs or
bats. The GM determines which animals count as rodents.

## Tinkering Fingers Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You’re trained in Crafting. If you are trained in Crafting from
another source (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can Repair
an item without using a repair toolkit without taking the –2
circumstance penalty, improvising tools from whatever you have
at hand. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to
Repair an item when you have a repair toolkit.

## Vicious Incisors Feat 1


## Ratfolk

Your jaws unarmed attack deals 1d6 piercing damage instead of
1d4, and gains the backstabber trait. You can file down your teeth
and regrow them later on, enabling you to select this feat at any
level, and to retrain into and out of this feat.

## Warren Navigator Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You gain the trained proficiency rank in Survival. If you would
automatically become trained in Survival (from your background
or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your
choice. When you Sense Direction or attempt a roll against a
quandary spell, you get a result one degree of success better than
you rolled. You don’t take a penalty to Sense Direction when you
lack a compass.

## 5Th Level


## Cornered Fury Feat 5


## Ratfolk

If a foe of a larger size than you critically hits and damages you,
that foe is off-guard to you for 1 round.

## Lab Rat Feat 5


## Ratfolk

You’ve spent more than your share of time in an alchemy lab. You
have been exposed to a wide variety of alchemical poisons and
harmful substances, leaving you with an increased tolerance of
their effects. You have a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against
poisons and diseases. If you roll a success on your saving throw
against a poison or disease, you get a critical success instead.
### Quick Stow [free-action] FEAT 5

## Ratfolk

Prerequisites Cheek Pouches
Frequency once per round
You Interact to store one item you’re holding in your cheek
pouches (provided it fits).

## Rat Magic Feat 5


## Ratfolk

There always seems to be a little rat around to carry messages
for you. You can cast animal messenger once per day as a primal
innate spell. When you do, the animal that responds is always a
rat. If there are no rats within range, the spell is lost.
### Ratfolk Roll [two-actions] FEAT 5

## Move Ratfolk

You roll up into a ball and move up to four times your Speed in

a straight line down an incline. If you reach the bottom of the
incline or hit an obstacle during this first turn of movement,
you stop rolling safely. Otherwise, you automatically keep
rolling at this Speed during subsequent turns until you hit
the bottom of the incline or an obstacle ends this movement
(which can happen in the middle of your turn). You’re slowed
2 each turn after the first that you keep rolling, and if you hit
an obstacle on a turn after the first, you and the obstacle both
take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and you stop rolling.

## 9Th Level


## Big Mouth Feat 9


## Ratfolk

Prerequisites Cheek Pouches
Instead of storing up to four items of Light Bulk in your
cheek pouches, you can store up to 1 Bulk worth of items. The
maximum size of a given item is unchanged.

## Overcrowd Feat 9


## Ratfolk

As long as you are Small, you can end your movement in the
same square as a Small ally. Only two creatures total can share
the same space when using this ability or a similar one.
### Rat Form [one-action] FEAT 9

## Concentrate Polymorph Primal Ratfolk

You can transform into an innocuous-looking
rat. You gain the effects of a 1st-rank pest
form spell, but you must assume the battle
form of a Tiny rat.

## Uncanny Cheeks Feat 9


## Ratfolk

You gain the Prescient Consumable and Prescient
Planner feats (Player Core 260), except that you
always withdraw the objects from your cheek
pouches. This means the object you retrieve must
fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of
negligible Bulk unless you also have the Cheek Pouches
feat.

## 13Th Level


## Shinstabber Feat 13


## Ratfolk

Prerequisites Overcrowd
As long as you’re Small or smaller, you can end your movement
in the same square as an ally of any size. Only two creatures
total can share the same space when using this ability or a
similar one.

## Skittering Sneak Feat 13


## Ratfolk

You squish, slink, and skitter from cover to cover with great speed
and stealth. You can move up to your full Speed when you Sneak.

## Warren Digger Feat 13


## Ratfolk

You’ve learned to put your sturdy claws to work digging
through the earth. You gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet.

## 17Th Level

### Call The Swarm [three-actions] FEAT 17

## Ratfolk

Prerequisites Ratspeak
Frequency once per day
You give a shrill whistle and point, and a massive swarm of rats
pours forth from the surrounding terrain to fill a 30-foot burst
within 120 feet. The rats scurry over the ground and climb up
walls and surfaces, biting and clawing as they deal 6d8 piercing
damage to all enemies in the area. The rats continue to swarm
in the area for the next minute, dealing 3d8 piercing damage to
any enemy that ends its turn in the area and transforming the
area into difficult terrain (though the rats allow you and your
allies to pass normally). You can Dismiss the effect.
### Greater Than The Sum  FEAT 17

## Ratfolk

You call upon the familial bonds you share with your allies
and other ratfolk to become an overwhelming force in
battle. You can cast enlarge as a 6th-rank primal
innate spell once per day.

Tengu are survivalists and conversationalists, equally at
home living off the wilderness and finding a niche in dense
cities. They accumulate knowledge, tools, and companions,
adding them to their collection as they travel.
The tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search
of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to
lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengu
notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”—
members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately or
otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of
conditions and locations, tengu tend to be nonjudgmental,
though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has
often led some to regard them with suspicion.
If you want to play a character hailing from a rich history
of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new
practices as needed, you should play a tengu.
