## Kholo

- Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.
Others probably...
- Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.
- Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.
Physical Description
Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles,
sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their
bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and
softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in
an off-white, tan, or brown shade; spots and stripes are
both common. Kholo typically stand between 6 and 7 feet
tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and
correspondingly stronger. Kholo are considered adults at
15 and live about 60 years on average.
Society
Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20
family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members.
They are ruled by a council of female kholo who are typically
selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus
on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—
they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon
their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers
and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic
knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything
else relevant to the clan.
Newborn kholo are given a root name, typically
that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as
this is considered narcissistic). As a kholo reaches certain
milestones in their life, they add descriptors to their name.
Sample Names: Baobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in
Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia,
Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker
Beliefs
Kholo have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to
life and prioritize results over methods. They are usually
loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward
outsiders—whether this behavior is considered acceptable
varies depending on who they view as “their people.”
Many kholo pay homage to Lamashtu, both as the
originator of their people and a guide in a chaotic world.
However, some kholo often give homage to Calistria and
Shelyn. Nethys is the patron of bonekeepers.
Popular Edicts strengthen your allies and packmates,
recount the tales of your ancestors, neutralize foes
with tactics and cunning
Popular Anathema risk yourself or your
packmates for no reason, let a dead kholo or
loved one rot like carrion

Kholo Heritages
Kholo physiology can vary greatly across the land. Choose one of the
following kholo heritages at 1st level.
Ant Kholo
You’re a sharp-featured, big-eared kholo about 3 feet tall. Many are
skeptical that you are in fact a kholo. Your size is Small instead of Medium.
You are trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained
in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to
Lie when specifically claiming innocence, to Deception DCs against Sense
Motive checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative checks when you roll
Deception for initiative.
Cave Kholo
Storytellers spin ancient tales claiming that kholo lived in caves and
underground before most of your kind ventured into the light. You’re a
throwback to these ancients, with a broad chest and markings that resemble
short black slashes instead of spots. Your eyes are developed to see perfectly
in the dark, a valuable advantage to your clan. You gain darkvision.
Dog Kholo
You’re a nimble-bodied kholo with a prehistoric, almost dog-like build.
Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight
like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. If you have both
hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
Great Kholo
You’re an imposing, powerful kholo, with tawny fur and brown spots on
your hide. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8 and gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Reposition, Shove, or Trip.
Sweetbreath Kholo
You’re a striped, pale-furred kholo with oddly pleasant breath, which
you can use to entrance your prey. You are trained in Diplomacy (or
another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to checks to Make an Impression if the target can
smell your breath.
Winter Kholo
You’re a hardy kholo covered in thick, tufted fur that makes you able to
survive in the harsh winters of the colder territories. You gain cold resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as
if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme
cold becomes severe, and so on).
Witch Kholo
You’re a shaggy, dark-furred kholo capable of making some truly uncanny
sounds. You can cast the figment cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A
cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. In
addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Create a Diversion
and Impersonate when using only your voice.

Every kobold instinctively understands the importance
of power, and many are inclined to venerate those who
have it, whether they be mighty dragons, cruel fiends,
imperious fey, or even ancient artifacts. Kobolds seek
out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—
after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves
an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs
incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits
(and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren’s
benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters
and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their
territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever
ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove
happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it’s to
their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make
their fortunes in the wider world.
If you want a character with deadly cunning and who
bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should
play a kobold.
You might...
- Analyze your surroundings, always looking for
ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.
- Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group
dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.
