## Lizardfolk

You might...
- Hold your people’s history in high regard and look
to the past for solutions to present problems.
- Strive to adapt perfectly to your environment while
also keeping your culture and traditions intact.
Others probably...
- Assume you are beholden to tradition and have
ancient knowledge.
- See you as cold-blooded and callous due to your
subdued physical reactions.
Physical Description
Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but
share toothy snouts and long, powerful tails. Many sport
dorsal spikes or flashy neck frills that hint at their clan
lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15
and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands
6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime,
gaining strength and size with age.
Society
Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are
raised communally from the moment they break from
their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching
back thousands of years, brought to life through
epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites
performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk
are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future.
If they seem slow to act, it’s because their long history
has taught them the value of patience.
True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they
are partially or mostly submerged in water. Lizardfolk
bones often adorn the walls, as many lizardfolk believe
these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when
the residents are in danger.
Lizardfolk names are typically chosen by the clan’s
astrologer in accordance to omens and which star
signs are ascendant when an iruxi egg hatches.
Sample Names: Arasheg, Barashk, Essaru, Enshuk,
Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru,
Tizkar, Utakish, Zelkelek
Beliefs
Most iruxis are unconcerned with heavy questions of
morality and focus their efforts on a local level. Iruxi religion
plays a large role in their culture, but in a heavily practical
way, blending animism and ancestor worship with druidic
rites. Of the gods, only Gozreh is commonly revered.
Popular Edicts keep memories of the past alive, wait for
your prey, adapt your plans to fit the environment
Popular Anathema defy the will of the stars

Lizardfolk Heritages
While most lizardfolk prefer wetlands, eons of evolution and cultural
adaptation enable them to live in more challenging environments. Choose
one of the following lizardfolk heritages at 1st level.
Cliffscale Lizardfolk
Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the Combat Climber
feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren’t wearing footwear, you can use the
sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you
roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.
Cloudleaper Lizardfolk
Your body is light with flaps of skin along your limbs that catch the air that
passes beneath you. As long as you can act and have enough room, you can
open the flaps to slow any fall just enough to avoid taking damage (whether
you have the room to do so depends on the GM’s discretion).
Frilled Lizardfolk
You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, Demoralizing your foes.
When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and
you don’t take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn’t
understand your language. You also gain the Threatening Approach action.
Threatening Approach [two-actions] Effect You Stride to be adjacent to a foe and Demoralize
that foe. If you succeed, the foe is frightened 2 instead of frightened 1.
Sandstrider Lizardfolk
Your thick scales help you retain water and combat the sun’s glare. You gain fire
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). Environmental heat effects are
one step less extreme for you, and you can go 10 times as long as normal before
you are affected by starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear
or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
Unseen Lizardfolk
You can change your skin color to blend in with your surroundings, making
minor shifts with a single action and dramatic changes over the course of
an hour. When you’re in an area where your coloration is roughly similar
to the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the
minor, single-action application of this ability to make localized changes that
help you blend into your surroundings, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks until your surroundings change in coloration or pattern.
Wetlander Lizardfolk
Your family is descended from the most common lizardfolk heritage, and you
are accustomed to aquatic environments. You gain a 15-foot swim Speed.
Woodstalker Lizardfolk
You move easily through thick forest and jungle, using every branch or bush.
You can always use the Take Cover action when in forest or jungle terrain to
gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you would normally be able
to Take Cover behind. You gain the Terrain Stalker feat, even if you’re not
trained in Stealth, and you must choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
Lizardfolk Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a lizardfolk,

the primal spell list. You can cast this cantrip as an innate spell
at will, and it’s heightened to a spell rank equal to half your

get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability
that would improve the save in this way (such as the battle
hardened fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on

Ysoki are beings that most surface-dwelling humanoids
refer to as “ratfolk.” They are a communal people who
prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals
living in a given home. If they can’t find homes in town,
ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes,
as these provide great storage for the many and varied
goods they bring back from trading expeditions.
Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found
on the road in merchant caravans. They’re good with
their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything
out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They’re
also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed
full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous
generations and stowed away in preparation for some
future emergency.
If you want a character who is smart, fast, welltraveled,
and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!
You might...
- Have pride in your large extended family, and stay
in contact with everyone in it.
- Like to travel near and far in search of new
experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way.
Others probably...
- Are surprised by your careful grooming and other
fastidious habits.
- Think you’re crowding them and invading their
personal space.
