## Kobold

Others probably...
- Assume that you are cowardly and won’t stick
around in the face of danger.
- Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness,
especially when it comes to building defenses.
Physical Description
Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids
with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns. Their
features often reflect the nature of their warren’s benefactor,
such as vestigial draconic wings or glowing crystalline
growths. These differences set warrens apart, though all
kobolds are generally easily recognizable as such.
Kobolds mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12
years and living to about 60. Some rare kobolds live even
longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor.
Society
Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them
alive. They’re secretive or subservient around powerful
creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades
once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a
dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an
artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly
adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their
benefactor’s personality. However, kobolds are infamous
for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source
of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.
A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a
syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and
accomplish great deeds, they might add more syllables to
their names. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an
effort to better fit into a community, in which case they
typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that
group.
Sample Names: Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn,
Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak,
Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz
Beliefs
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural
respect for hierarchies and rules, relying on their
ancestral social strategies for survival.
Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds. They’re
often drawn to deities related to their benefactors, such as
Asmodeus if the benefactor is a devil, or dragon deities like
Apsu and Dahak if the benefactor is a dragon. Kobolds also
often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with
powerful magical creatures as figureheads.
Popular Edicts find your place in any power structure, take
pride in your allies’ strength, win with your wits
Popular Anathema face a threat alone, throw caution to the wind

Kobold Heritages
Proud, opportunistic, and crafty, kobolds manifest certain physical aspects
due to their benefactor. Choose one of the following kobold heritages at
1st level.
Cavernstalker Kobold
You hatched in a warren with narrow tunnels that was also home to a
being of primal earth energy, which has made you limber and flexible. When
Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone features, you move
at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and
you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb). This doesn’t
affect you if you’re using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an Acrobatics
check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
Dragonscaled Kobold
Thanks to your warren’s association with a dragon, your scales are sturdier
than other kobolds’. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of
6. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against dragon breath, effects
with the sleep trait, and effects that would make you paralyzed.
Elementheart Kobold
When you hatched, you imprinted on a creature strongly associated with
one of the Elemental Planes, such as an elemental or genie. Choose air, earth,
fire, metal, water, or wood for your elemental benefactor. You gain resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage type associated with
your elemental benefactor: cold for air, electricity for earth, fire for fire, sonic
for metal, acid for water, or poison for wood.
Spellhorn Kobold
Since hatching in the vicinity of a powerful source of magic, a trace of it
flows through your veins. Choose one common cantrip from the arcane
spell list (238, Player Core 304–307). You can Cast this Spell as an arcane
innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your
level rounded up. You are trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC
statistics, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
Strongjaw Kobold
Your warren is noted for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, either to help
protect against natural predators or due to reverence of a mighty beast. You
gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your jaws are in
the brawling group and have the finesse and unarmed traits.
Tunnelflood Kobold
You grew up in a warren crisscrossed by underwater passages, whether
natural or excavated, and were influenced by a powerful aquatic entity or
being of primal water. You gain a swim Speed of 15 feet.
Venomtail Kobold
Thanks to the proximity of a venomous creature to your warren, you were
born with a vestigial spur in your tail that secretes deadly venom. You gain
the Tail Toxin action.
Tail Toxin [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per day; Requirements You are wielding
a piercing or slashing weapon; Effect You apply your tail’s venom to a piercing or
slashing weapon. If your next Strike with that weapon before the end of your next
turn hits and deals damage, you deal persistent poison damage equal to your level
to the target.

At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a kobold, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.

## 1St Level

### Cringe [reaction] FEAT 1

## Emotion Kobold Mental Visual

Strike against you and would deal damage to you.

attack. The attacking creature takes a circumstance penalty
to the damage of the triggering Strike equal to your level + 2.
This penalty applies after doubling the damage for a critical
hit. The attacker is then immune to your Cringe for 24 hours.

## Dragon’S Presence Feat 1


## Kobold

Prerequisite dragonscaled kobold heritage
As kin to dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence (that

fear effect, you get a critical failure instead.

your level or lower, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the
Intimidation check.

## Kobold Lore Feat 1


## Kobold

You attentively learned key kobold survival strategies from
your elders. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Stealth

example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Kobold Lore.

preparations, you can prepare three snares from your formula
book for quick deployment (increasing to four snares if you’re
a master in Crafting and five if you’re legendary). Snares
prepared in this way don’t cost you any resources to Craft.

of its next turn.

## Kobold

Through the lingering influence of your warren’s patron, you’ve
sprouted a small set of wings. While not suitable for full flight,
these weak wings can help you jump further with a small flap.

additional distance isn’t cumulative with the increased Leap
distance from the Powerful Leap feat. In addition, when you
attempt a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet
farther than you normally would based on the result of your
Athletics check, though you still can’t jump farther than your

Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires
considered ancient even by the elves.
Lizardfolk move through the societies of other
humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators.
They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding
rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though lizardfolk
have adapted to many different environments, many of
them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using
their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As
a result, they usually prefer equipment that is not easily
damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for
gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.
