## Hobgoblin

Others probably...
- Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation
and intimidating appearance.
- Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication,
and discipline.
Physical Description
Hobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as
well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned.
They’re remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from
illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long
periods of time with little difficulty.
Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk,
and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They
reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood
around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age.
Society
Hobgoblins structure their society after military
hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming
collectives or trading houses organize into regiments,
companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high
place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors.
Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most
hobgoblins don’t trust it over the strength of their own
sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many
hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing
the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing.
Like goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple,
though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural
and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter
their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually
in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event.
Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both
pointless and presumptuous; an individual’s merits and
demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an
association with a particular lineage.
Sample Names: Aze, Druknar, Ghargam, Hathkren,
Imakra, Kralaeng, Mazkol, Olzu, Rezal, Sivkrag,
Volmak, Zornum
Beliefs
Most hobgoblins prefer to live within established hierarchies.
While many consider sentimentality weak, those with mild
temperaments have recently found success in diplomacy and
international outreach. Faith has little place in hobgoblin
society, as many feel it is impractical, though religious
hobgoblins can gain a begrudging modicum of acceptance
due to their useful healing magic.
Popular Edicts disdain arcane magic, hide sentimentality and
positive emotions, jump at chances to prove yourself
Popular Anathema disobey military orders

Hobgoblin Heritages
Hobgoblins have a wide range of physiological differences based primarily
on their family lineage. Choose one of the following hobgoblin heritages at
1st level.
Elfbane Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund
goblins to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately
freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral
resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist
Elf Magic reaction.
Resist Elf Magic [reaction] Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but
haven’t rolled yet; Effect Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the triggering effect is
arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.
Runtboss Hobgoblin
You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are
smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you
bellow. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an
Intimidation check to Coerce a goblin, you get a critical success instead; if
you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
Shortshanks Hobgoblin
You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins,
making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong,
muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you
in riding and climbing—and you’ve trained at riding in a saddle from an
extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not offguard
while you Climb.
Smokeworker Hobgoblin
Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations,
laboring on projects that bring smoke and fire to the field of battle. You
gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically
succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature
is concealed only by smoke.
Warmarch Hobgoblin
You come from a line of wandering mercenaries constantly on the march and
scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but don’t critically fail, to Subsist
in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When
exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop.
Warrenbred Hobgoblin
Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other
hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. While you’re underground, when you
target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce
the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In
addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a
critical success instead.
Hobgoblin Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a
hobgoblin, you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

## 1St Level


## Alchemical Scholar Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat. If you would
automatically gain that feat (from your background or the
alchemist class, for example), you instead gain a different
1st-level Crafting skill feat. Add an additional common 1st-level
alchemical formula to your formula book when you take this
feat. Each time you gain a level beyond 1st, add one common
alchemical formula of that level to your formula book.

## Cantorian Reinforcement Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

The life energy that helped create the first hobgoblins is
particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing
maladies. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a
disease or poison, you get a critical success instead. If you
have a different ability that would improve the save in this
way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you
roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

## Hobgoblin Lore Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You’ve studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all
of which have a militaristic bent. You gain the trained proficiency
rank in Athletics and Crafting. If you would automatically become
trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You gain the Additional Lore general feat for Hobgoblin Lore.
### Hobgoblin Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 1

## Hobgoblin

You gain access to all uncommon weapons with the hobgoblin
trait. You have familiarity with weapons with the hobgoblin trait
plus the composite longbow, composite shortbow, glaive, longbow,
longsword, and shortbow—for the purpose of proficiency, you
treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons
and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
### Leech-Clip [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Hobgoblin

You are trained to capture deserters, or “leeches.” Make a melee
Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes
a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty
on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the
target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable
appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed,
this can’t reduce a creature’s Speed below 5 feet.

## Remorseless Lash Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You’re skilled at beating an enemy when their morale is already
breaking. When you succeed at a melee weapon Strike against
a frightened enemy, that enemy can’t reduce their frightened
condition below 1 until the beginning of your next turn.

## Sneaky Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

Stealth is an important tool in your arsenal. You can move 5
feet farther when you take the Sneak action, up to your Speed.
In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions
and succeed at your Stealth check, you don’t become observed
if you don’t have cover or greater cover and aren’t concealed
at the end of the Sneak action, as long as you have cover or
greater cover or are concealed at the end of your turn.

## Stone Face Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You’ve mastered the art of composure, even in the face of fear.
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against effects with
the fear trait and a +2 circumstance bonus to your Will DC
against Intimidation skill actions, such as Demoralize.

## Vigorous Health Feat 1


## Hobgoblin

You can withstand blood loss startlingly well. Whenever you
would gain the drained condition, you can attempt a DC 17 flat
check. On a success, you don’t gain the drained condition.

## 5Th Level


## Agonizing Rebuke Feat 5


## Hobgoblin

When you terrorize your enemies, you also cause them painful
mental distress. When you successfully Demoralize an enemy,
that enemy takes 1d4 mental damage at the start of each of
its turns. This effect ends if the creature loses the frightened
condition, if it is more than 30 feet away from you, or if 1 minute
passes, whichever comes first. If you have master proficiency
in Intimidation, the damage increases to 2d4, and if you have
legendary proficiency, the damage increases to 3d4.
### Expert Drill Sergeant  FEAT 5

## Hobgoblin

While exploring, when you are leading and allies are Following
the Expert, instead of granting a +2 circumstance bonus in the
applicable skill, you grant a +3 circumstance bonus if you’re an
expert and a +4 circumstance bonus if you’re a master.
### Recognize Ambush [free-action] FEAT 5

## Hobgoblin

Trigger You roll initiative.
Your combat training has honed you to be ready for an attack
at all times. You Interact to draw a weapon.

embarrassments or expendable annoyances, you have

studied the methodology behind their irresponsible and
incomprehensible actions. You gain the Adopted Ancestry
general feat and must select goblin as the feat’s chosen
ancestry. You also gain one 1st-level goblin ancestry feat.

You have trained with your animal companion to become a
terrifying juggernaut on the battlefield. Your animal companion
becomes trained in Intimidation. If your animal companion uses
Support while serving as your mount, it grants you the effects of
the Aid reaction on your first Intimidation check to Demoralize on
the same turn, even though it can’t take reactions.
### Pride In Arms [reaction] FEAT 9

## Auditory Emotion Hobgoblin Mental

Trigger An ally within 30 feet brings an enemy to 0 Hit Points.
With a shout of triumph, you grant inspiration to an ally fight
on. The triggering ally gains temporary Hit Points equal to
their Constitution modifier until the end of their next turn.

consequence; your ally’s wounded condition increases by 1.

The energy that flows in your blood can save a life in the direst
of times. You prevent the creature from dying and restore

use Cantorian Restoration if the triggering effect was a death
effect or an effect that leaves no remains, such as disintegrate.
### Rallying Cry [two-actions] FEAT 17

## Auditory Hobgoblin

Frequency once per day
You call out to your allies and push them to give their all in
combat. All allies in a 30-foot emanation that can hear you
gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level. In
addition, these allies become quickened for 1 minute but can
use the extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike.

Kholo have bad reputations as brutal raiders and
demon-worshipers. Many believe that kholo are witches,
cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex. Kholo
are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders.
To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any
loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their
packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but
victory, whether it’s mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of
immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints,
and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the
kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism.
Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a
grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons.
Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring
their enemy’s cunning or strength into the clan.

- Be physically demonstrative—hugging,
punching, or licking your friends.
