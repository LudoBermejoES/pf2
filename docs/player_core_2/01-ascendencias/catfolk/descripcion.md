## Catfolk

You might...
- Demonstrate genuine interest by asking a lot of
enthusiastic questions.
- Avoid interpersonal conflict by giving someone a
cold shoulder or by simply leaving the area.
Others probably...
- Think you monopolize conversations with your
incessant queries or opinions.
- Ascribe more emotion than you feel to your
involuntary purrs or growling.
Physical Description
Although all catfolk walk upright and have soft fur, a
tail, large ears, and vertical pupils, they show at least as
much variety as ordinary felines. Catfolk have nimble
fingers with short claws that are usually retractable.
Catfolk mature quickly and are able to walk at only a few
months old, but they start their careers at roughly the same
age as humans do and live to be 60 or 70 years of age.
Society
Catfolk call themselves amurruns, although many
consider this name to be private. They raise their children
in large extended families, where they are given latitude
to explore and get into trouble from a remarkably young
age. Catfolk learn a trade in a loose apprenticeship, and
the majority learn several trades over their lives.
Catfolk societies are often led by an appointed leader
who speaks on behalf of the community and mediates
disputes. They prefer to deal with grievances by making
an elaborate showing of disinterest, or even leaving a
community for a time so the problem can die away.
Catfolk are given short names in their youth.
Adolescent catfolk are free to choose a different
name when they first leave home.
Sample Names: Alyara, Crinto, Drewan, Espes,
Ferrus, Gerran, Halhat, Hoya, Ruun, Sevastin,
Tespa, Yonsol, Zakkar, Zathra
Beliefs
Most catfolk believe they were uplifted
from great primeval cats to confront the evil
abominations despoiling natural places and
laboring to unmake reality. Many, however, enjoy
the freedom to travel and like to set their own paths
in life. Religious catfolk most often practice a nebulous
form of animism, appeasing the spirits of the land and the
creatures they hunt to preserve the natural order.
Popular Edicts travel the world, protect natural places,
fastidiously maintain your appearance
Popular Anathema leave questions unanswered

Catfolk Heritages
Catfolk have ancestors as varied as any felines. Choose one of the following
catfolk heritages at 1st level.
Clawed Catfolk
Your family has particularly long, sharp claws capable of delivering bleeding
wounds with a wicked swipe. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d6
slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile,
finesse, and unarmed traits.
Hunting Catfolk
You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a
particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30
feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s
location, as explained on page 433 of Player Core. The GM will usually
double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range
if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Track a creature or
object if you’ve smelled it before.

and underbrush. You ignore difficult terrain from undergrowth, and greater
difficult terrain from undergrowth is only difficult terrain for you.

between dimensions grow thin. You can cast the detect magic cantrip as an occult
innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to half your level rounded up. You
also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Recall Knowledge
about creatures that originated on planes other than the Universe.
Nine Lives Catfolk
Your family has always seems to bounce back from disaster, not through
physical hardiness or specialized skill, but from sheer luck. Other catfolk
whisper that you have nine lives. While you’re dying, you don’t add your
dying value to the DC of your recovery checks (this means the DC is typically
10). In addition, you gain the Diehard general feat.

perk up at any unexpected sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek
action. As long as you’re aware of a creature via sound, once per round, your
ears can help you Point Out the creature to all allies as a free action.
Winter Catfolk
You have a thick coat of fur that protects you from the cold. You gain cold
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental
cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes
extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).

Taller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins
are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad
shoulders and long, powerful arms. The Avistani cycle
of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been
upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin
nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas.
Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other
nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously
investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than
conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered
terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is
simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough
strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold
soldiers might prove to be powerful allies.
You might...
- Seek out the most effective and practical solutions
to any problem.
- Encourage a clear chain of command among any
group you travel with, following orders even if you
disagree with them.
