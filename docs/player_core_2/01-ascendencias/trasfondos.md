## Introduction

More of Everything
Player Core 2 provides even more options for player
characters. Along with the ancestries and classes
summarized on the following page, there are additional
general and skill feats, equipment, spells, and treasure
round out your characters’ abilities.
Alongside the eight new multiclass archetypes for the
classes in this book, you can find archetypes for all sorts
of characters starting on page 172. These can expand any
Pathfinder character in unexpected directions, helping them
discover new abilities to match their developing stories.
Many of these archetypes support combat specializations,
like the bastion and wrestler, while others show off the
roles characters may be stepping into, like the blessed one
and marshal. Even characters’ growing skills can uncover
deeper specializations, like the archaeologist and medic.
In addition to an expansive slate of ancestries, this
book also contains three versatile heritages suitable for
characters of any ancestry:
- Dhampirs are the mortal offspring of vampires,
walking the line between life and undeath.
- Dragonbloods possess obvious draconic traits owing to
dragons’ influence, either direct or on their ancestors.
- Duskwalkers are souls reincarnated as a result of a
bargain between psychopomps, the guides of the dead.
How to Use This Book
The new options in this book expand on those in Player
Core, and that book is required to use Player Core 2. It’s easy
to dive in using an ancestry, class, and archetype from this
book, but endless variations come to life when combining
these with options from Player Core and other sources.
If you’re creating a new character, you’re probably
interested in the new ancestries (page 7), classes (page 54),
and backgrounds (page 50).
Even characters you’ve already created can benefit
from archetypes (page 172), along with new options for
feats (page 224), spells (page 236), and items (page 272).
Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. This book
combines with Player Core, expanding on its options and giving you even more ways to play
the character you want!

## Uncommon Ancestries And Heritages

Each new ancestry in this book is uncommon. Though
uncommon elements of the game are usually acquired
during play, you choose your ancestry and heritage at
the beginning of the game. This means you should talk
to your group and GM about which uncommon ancestries
and heritages make sense for the story. In the pirate-laden
Shackles, tengu are a regular sight. But they’re even
more common in the eastern continent of Tian Xia, where
halflings and dwarves are uncommon! Even if your chosen
ancestry isn’t particularly common in the area where the
story takes place, most times you can work with your GM
and the other players to find a great way to incorporate
that character into the narrative. This discussion might
point toward ways an uncommon ancestry might figure
into the game and set the stage for how they interact with
the other characters. In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the
accompanying player’s guide might include information
about additional uncommon options that make sense for
that story and its region and grant you automatic access
to play them during those adventures.

## Rare And Unique Backgrounds

Some backgrounds have enough story weight that you
need to work with the rest of your group to determine
if they’re right for a particular story, like being heir to a
throne. You can find more information about these special
backgrounds on page 52.
This chapter expands your starting character options
from those available in Player Core and includes each
of the following sections. You can also find a summary
of each ancestry and heritage, along with the classes in
this book, on page 5 so that you can make the primary
decisions for creating your character at a glance.
Ancestries
Expand beyond the populous ancestries found in the
Player Core. Many of these ancestries are less common
than those presented in that book. The ancestry entry
format is described on page 41 of Player Core.
- Catfolk (page 8), or amurruns, are humanoid
felines who believe they were created to protect the
wilderness from great danger.
- Hobgoblins (page 12) are goblins’ stronger and
taller cousins, often devoted to proving themselves
in battle.
- Kholos (page 16) are hyena-headed humanoids who
practice ancestor worship and consume their dead
to honor them.
- Kobolds (page 20) are diligent crafters whose small,
reptilian forms are influenced in the egg by the
proximity of powerful magic.
- Lizardfolk (page 24), or iruxi, have fanged snouts,
long tails, and rich oral traditions.
- Ratfolk (page 28), or ysoki, pack into tight spaces
and are markedly industrious and fastidious.
- Tengu (page 32) are corvid-like humanoids with an
affinity for blades and the rumored mystical ability
to absorb bad luck.
- Tripkees (page 36) are froglike humanoids who
rely on their cunning and curiosity to keep their
communities safe.
Versatile Heritages
As in Player Core, this book presents versatile heritages,
which are certain heritages that can occur across all
ancestries, and which you can choose instead of one of
the heritages listed in your ancestry’s section. For instance,
if your father was a vampire, you could be a dhampir
whether you’re a human, orc, or catfolk. Rules for versatile
heritages are found on page 74 of Player Core.
- Dhampirs (page 42) are part vampires due to an
early connection to vampire blood.
Your character’s ancestry and background tell the story of who you were before you became
an adventurer, as well as who you might strive to become one day. But not everyone fits
neatly into the most common ancestries or backgrounds. You might be a birdlike tengu, a
scaled kobold, or a curious catfolk with a one-of-a-kind background in your story. Perhaps
your ancestry carries the blood of dragons or vampires. Only you can decide!

## Chapter 1:


## Ancestries & Backgrounds

- Dragonbloods (page 44) are scions of powerful
dragons, often exhibiting their majesty and magic.
- Duskwalkers (page 48) are souls reincarnated
into mortal form, who are tied to psychopomp
guardians.
Backgrounds
This chapter contains new backgrounds for characters
from all walks of life, from couriers to saboteurs. This
section also includes a set of special rare backgrounds
that you and your GM might agree to use in a campaign.
- Common Backgrounds (page 50)
- Rare Backgrounds (page 52)

Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine the
features of felines and humanoids in both appearance
and temperament. They enjoy learning new things,
collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their
loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves
as the chosen guardians of natural places in the world
and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of
overwhelming opposition. They believe that strong
communities, breadth of experience, and continual selfimprovement
aid them in this fight.
As quick as their reflexes are, catfolk have quicker
tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in
an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily
purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry.
If you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly,
and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk.

## Catfolk

You might...
- Demonstrate genuine interest by asking a lot of
enthusiastic questions.
- Avoid interpersonal conflict by giving someone a
cold shoulder or by simply leaving the area.
Others probably...
- Think you monopolize conversations with your
incessant queries or opinions.
- Ascribe more emotion than you feel to your
involuntary purrs or growling.
Physical Description
Although all catfolk walk upright and have soft fur, a
tail, large ears, and vertical pupils, they show at least as
much variety as ordinary felines. Catfolk have nimble
fingers with short claws that are usually retractable.
Catfolk mature quickly and are able to walk at only a few
months old, but they start their careers at roughly the same
age as humans do and live to be 60 or 70 years of age.
Society
Catfolk call themselves amurruns, although many
consider this name to be private. They raise their children
in large extended families, where they are given latitude
to explore and get into trouble from a remarkably young
age. Catfolk learn a trade in a loose apprenticeship, and
the majority learn several trades over their lives.
Catfolk societies are often led by an appointed leader
who speaks on behalf of the community and mediates
disputes. They prefer to deal with grievances by making
an elaborate showing of disinterest, or even leaving a
community for a time so the problem can die away.
Catfolk are given short names in their youth.
Adolescent catfolk are free to choose a different
name when they first leave home.
Sample Names: Alyara, Crinto, Drewan, Espes,
Ferrus, Gerran, Halhat, Hoya, Ruun, Sevastin,
Tespa, Yonsol, Zakkar, Zathra
Beliefs
Most catfolk believe they were uplifted
from great primeval cats to confront the evil
abominations despoiling natural places and
laboring to unmake reality. Many, however, enjoy
the freedom to travel and like to set their own paths
in life. Religious catfolk most often practice a nebulous
form of animism, appeasing the spirits of the land and the
creatures they hunt to preserve the natural order.
Popular Edicts travel the world, protect natural places,
fastidiously maintain your appearance
Popular Anathema leave questions unanswered

Catfolk Heritages
Catfolk have ancestors as varied as any felines. Choose one of the following
catfolk heritages at 1st level.
Clawed Catfolk
Your family has particularly long, sharp claws capable of delivering bleeding
wounds with a wicked swipe. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d6
slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile,
finesse, and unarmed traits.
Hunting Catfolk
You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a
particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30
feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s
location, as explained on page 433 of Player Core. The GM will usually
double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range
if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Track a creature or
object if you’ve smelled it before.
Jungle Catfolk
You’re descended from jungle stalkers and can move swiftly through scrub
and underbrush. You ignore difficult terrain from undergrowth, and greater
difficult terrain from undergrowth is only difficult terrain for you.
Liminal Catfolk
You’ve inherited a closeness to the far corners of the world, where the boundaries
between dimensions grow thin. You can cast the detect magic cantrip as an occult
innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to half your level rounded up. You
also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Recall Knowledge
about creatures that originated on planes other than the Universe.
Nine Lives Catfolk
Your family has always seems to bounce back from disaster, not through
physical hardiness or specialized skill, but from sheer luck. Other catfolk
whisper that you have nine lives. While you’re dying, you don’t add your
dying value to the DC of your recovery checks (this means the DC is typically
10). In addition, you gain the Diehard general feat.
Sharp-Eared Catfolk
You were born with big, expressive ears that move with your moods and
perk up at any unexpected sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek
action. As long as you’re aware of a creature via sound, once per round, your
ears can help you Point Out the creature to all allies as a free action.
Winter Catfolk
You have a thick coat of fur that protects you from the cold. You gain cold
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental
cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes
extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level). As a catfolk,
you can select from among the following ancestry feats.

Taller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins
are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad
shoulders and long, powerful arms. The Avistani cycle
of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been
upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin
nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas.
Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other
nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously
investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than
conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered
terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is
simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough
strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold
soldiers might prove to be powerful allies.
You might...
- Seek out the most effective and practical solutions
to any problem.
- Encourage a clear chain of command among any
group you travel with, following orders even if you
disagree with them.

## Hobgoblin

Others probably...
- Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation
and intimidating appearance.
- Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication,
and discipline.
Physical Description
Hobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as
well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned.
They’re remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from
illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long
periods of time with little difficulty.
Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk,
and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They
reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood
around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age.
Society
Hobgoblins structure their society after military
hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming
collectives or trading houses organize into regiments,
companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high
place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors.
Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most
hobgoblins don’t trust it over the strength of their own
sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many
hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing
the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing.
Like goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple,
though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural
and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter
their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually
in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event.
Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both
pointless and presumptuous; an individual’s merits and
demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an
association with a particular lineage.
Sample Names: Aze, Druknar, Ghargam, Hathkren,
Imakra, Kralaeng, Mazkol, Olzu, Rezal, Sivkrag,
Volmak, Zornum
Beliefs
Most hobgoblins prefer to live within established hierarchies.
While many consider sentimentality weak, those with mild
temperaments have recently found success in diplomacy and
international outreach. Faith has little place in hobgoblin
society, as many feel it is impractical, though religious
hobgoblins can gain a begrudging modicum of acceptance
due to their useful healing magic.
Popular Edicts disdain arcane magic, hide sentimentality and
positive emotions, jump at chances to prove yourself
Popular Anathema disobey military orders

Hobgoblin Heritages
Hobgoblins have a wide range of physiological differences based primarily
on their family lineage. Choose one of the following hobgoblin heritages at
1st level.
Elfbane Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins were engineered long ago from the unreliable and fecund
goblins to be used as an army against the elves. Although the elves ultimately
freed the hobgoblins from their bondage, some hobgoblins retain ancestral
resistance to magic, which they refer to as “elf magic.” You gain the Resist
Elf Magic reaction.
Resist Elf Magic [reaction] Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect but
haven’t rolled yet; Effect Your ancestral resistance to magic protects you. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the triggering effect is
arcane, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.
Runtboss Hobgoblin
You come from a long line of hobgoblins who commanded goblins. You are
smaller than other hobgoblins, but goblins still listen to any commands you
bellow. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. If you roll a success on an
Intimidation check to Coerce a goblin, you get a critical success instead; if
you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
Shortshanks Hobgoblin
You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins,
making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong,
muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you
in riding and climbing—and you’ve trained at riding in a saddle from an
extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you are not offguard
while you Climb.
Smokeworker Hobgoblin
Your family have been alchemists, engineers, and scientists for generations,
laboring on projects that bring smoke and fire to the field of battle. You
gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You automatically
succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a concealed creature if that creature
is concealed only by smoke.
Warmarch Hobgoblin
You come from a line of wandering mercenaries constantly on the march and
scavenging food on the trail. If you fail, but don’t critically fail, to Subsist
in the wilderness, you can still keep yourself fed with poor meals. When
exploring, you can Hustle twice as long before you have to stop.
Warrenbred Hobgoblin
Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other
hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. While you’re underground, when you
target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce
the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In
addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a
critical success instead.
Hobgoblin Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a

feat. Each time you gain a level beyond 1st, add one common
alchemical formula of that level to your formula book.

particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing
maladies. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a

these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.
### Leech-Clip [two-actions] FEAT 1

You are trained to capture deserters, or “leeches.” Make a melee
Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes
a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty
on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the

appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed,
this can’t reduce a creature’s Speed below 5 feet.

## Remorseless Lash Feat 1

mental distress. When you successfully Demoralize an enemy,

its turns. This effect ends if the creature loses the frightened
condition, if it is more than 30 feet away from you, or if 1 minute
passes, whichever comes first. If you have master proficiency
in Intimidation, the damage increases to 2d4, and if you have
legendary proficiency, the damage increases to 3d4.
### Expert Drill Sergeant  FEAT 5

## Hobgoblin

Kholo have bad reputations as brutal raiders and
demon-worshipers. Many believe that kholo are witches,
cannibals, and worse. The truth is more complex. Kholo
are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders.
To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any
loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their
packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but
victory, whether it’s mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of
immoral. Kholo are masters of ambushes, tactical feints,
and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the
kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism.
Kholo consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a
grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons.
Kholo extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring
their enemy’s cunning or strength into the clan.
You might...
- Be physically demonstrative—hugging,
punching, or licking your friends.

## Kholo

- Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.
Others probably...
- Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.
- Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.
Physical Description
Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles,
sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears. Their
bodies are covered in shaggy fur, rougher on the back and
softer and lighter on the stomach and throat, usually in
an off-white, tan, or brown shade; spots and stripes are
both common. Kholo typically stand between 6 and 7 feet
tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and
correspondingly stronger. Kholo are considered adults at
15 and live about 60 years on average.
Society
Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20
family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members.
They are ruled by a council of female kholo who are typically
selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus
on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—
they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon
their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers
and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic
knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything
else relevant to the clan.
Newborn kholo are given a root name, typically
that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as
this is considered narcissistic). As a kholo reaches certain
milestones in their life, they add descriptors to their name.
Sample Names: Baobab, Jackal, Onyx Elephant in
Shadows, Red Thorn, Unbent Iron Reed, White Acacia,
Wistful Tooth, Woodpecker
Beliefs
Kholo have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to
life and prioritize results over methods. They are usually
loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward
outsiders—whether this behavior is considered acceptable
varies depending on who they view as “their people.”
Many kholo pay homage to Lamashtu, both as the
originator of their people and a guide in a chaotic world.
However, some kholo often give homage to Calistria and
Shelyn. Nethys is the patron of bonekeepers.
Popular Edicts strengthen your allies and packmates,
recount the tales of your ancestors, neutralize foes
with tactics and cunning
Popular Anathema risk yourself or your
packmates for no reason, let a dead kholo or
loved one rot like carrion

Kholo Heritages
Kholo physiology can vary greatly across the land. Choose one of the
following kholo heritages at 1st level.
Ant Kholo
You’re a sharp-featured, big-eared kholo about 3 feet tall. Many are
skeptical that you are in fact a kholo. Your size is Small instead of Medium.
You are trained in Deception (or another skill if you were already trained
in Deception). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to
Lie when specifically claiming innocence, to Deception DCs against Sense
Motive checks to uncover such lies, and to initiative checks when you roll
Deception for initiative.
Cave Kholo
Storytellers spin ancient tales claiming that kholo lived in caves and
underground before most of your kind ventured into the light. You’re a
throwback to these ancients, with a broad chest and markings that resemble
short black slashes instead of spots. Your eyes are developed to see perfectly
in the dark, a valuable advantage to your clan. You gain darkvision.
Dog Kholo
You’re a nimble-bodied kholo with a prehistoric, almost dog-like build.
Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight
like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. If you have both
hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
Great Kholo
You’re an imposing, powerful kholo, with tawny fur and brown spots on
your hide. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8 and gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Reposition, Shove, or Trip.
Sweetbreath Kholo
You’re a striped, pale-furred kholo with oddly pleasant breath, which
you can use to entrance your prey. You are trained in Diplomacy (or
another skill if you were already trained in Diplomacy). You also gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to checks to Make an Impression if the target can
smell your breath.
Winter Kholo
You’re a hardy kholo covered in thick, tufted fur that makes you able to
survive in the harsh winters of the colder territories. You gain cold resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as
if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme
cold becomes severe, and so on).
Witch Kholo
You’re a shaggy, dark-furred kholo capable of making some truly uncanny
sounds. You can cast the figment cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A
cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. In
addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Create a Diversion
and Impersonate when using only your voice.
Kholo Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry

Every kobold instinctively understands the importance
of power, and many are inclined to venerate those who
have it, whether they be mighty dragons, cruel fiends,
imperious fey, or even ancient artifacts. Kobolds seek
out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—
after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves
an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs
incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits
(and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren’s
benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters
and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their
territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever
ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove
happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it’s to
their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make
their fortunes in the wider world.
If you want a character with deadly cunning and who
bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should
play a kobold.
You might...
- Analyze your surroundings, always looking for
ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.
- Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group
dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.

## Kobold

Others probably...
- Assume that you are cowardly and won’t stick
around in the face of danger.
- Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness,
especially when it comes to building defenses.
Physical Description
Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids
with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns. Their
features often reflect the nature of their warren’s benefactor,
such as vestigial draconic wings or glowing crystalline
growths. These differences set warrens apart, though all
kobolds are generally easily recognizable as such.
Kobolds mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12
years and living to about 60. Some rare kobolds live even
longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor.
Society
Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them
alive. They’re secretive or subservient around powerful
creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades
once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a
dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an
artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly
adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their
benefactor’s personality. However, kobolds are infamous
for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source
of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.
A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a
syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and
accomplish great deeds, they might add more syllables to
their names. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an
effort to better fit into a community, in which case they
typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that
group.
Sample Names: Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn,
Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak,
Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz
Beliefs
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural
respect for hierarchies and rules, relying on their
ancestral social strategies for survival.
Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds. They’re
often drawn to deities related to their benefactors, such as
Asmodeus if the benefactor is a devil, or dragon deities like
Apsu and Dahak if the benefactor is a dragon. Kobolds also
often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with
powerful magical creatures as figureheads.
Popular Edicts find your place in any power structure, take
pride in your allies’ strength, win with your wits
Popular Anathema face a threat alone, throw caution to the wind

Kobold Heritages
Proud, opportunistic, and crafty, kobolds manifest certain physical aspects
due to their benefactor. Choose one of the following kobold heritages at
1st level.
Cavernstalker Kobold
You hatched in a warren with narrow tunnels that was also home to a
being of primal earth energy, which has made you limber and flexible. When
Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone features, you move
at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and
you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb). This doesn’t
affect you if you’re using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an Acrobatics
check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
Dragonscaled Kobold
Thanks to your warren’s association with a dragon, your scales are sturdier
than other kobolds’. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of
6. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against dragon breath, effects
with the sleep trait, and effects that would make you paralyzed.
Elementheart Kobold
When you hatched, you imprinted on a creature strongly associated with
one of the Elemental Planes, such as an elemental or genie. Choose air, earth,
fire, metal, water, or wood for your elemental benefactor. You gain resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage type associated with
your elemental benefactor: cold for air, electricity for earth, fire for fire, sonic
for metal, acid for water, or poison for wood.

Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires
considered ancient even by the elves.
Lizardfolk move through the societies of other
humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators.
They have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding
rangers and unsentimental fighters. Though lizardfolk
have adapted to many different environments, many of
them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using
their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As
a result, they usually prefer equipment that is not easily
damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for
gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone.

## Lizardfolk

You might...
- Hold your people’s history in high regard and look
to the past for solutions to present problems.
- Strive to adapt perfectly to your environment while
also keeping your culture and traditions intact.
Others probably...
- Assume you are beholden to tradition and have
ancient knowledge.
- See you as cold-blooded and callous due to your
subdued physical reactions.
Physical Description
Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but
share toothy snouts and long, powerful tails. Many sport
dorsal spikes or flashy neck frills that hint at their clan
lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15
and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands
6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime,
gaining strength and size with age.
Society
Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are
raised communally from the moment they break from
their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching
back thousands of years, brought to life through
epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites
performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk
are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future.
If they seem slow to act, it’s because their long history
has taught them the value of patience.
True iruxi settlements are often overlooked, as they
are partially or mostly submerged in water. Lizardfolk
bones often adorn the walls, as many lizardfolk believe
these remains can be animated by ancestral spirits when
the residents are in danger.
Lizardfolk names are typically chosen by the clan’s
astrologer in accordance to omens and which star
signs are ascendant when an iruxi egg hatches.
Sample Names: Arasheg, Barashk, Essaru, Enshuk,
Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru,
Tizkar, Utakish, Zelkelek
Beliefs
Most iruxis are unconcerned with heavy questions of
morality and focus their efforts on a local level. Iruxi religion
plays a large role in their culture, but in a heavily practical
way, blending animism and ancestor worship with druidic
rites. Of the gods, only Gozreh is commonly revered.
Popular Edicts keep memories of the past alive, wait for
your prey, adapt your plans to fit the environment
Popular Anathema defy the will of the stars

Lizardfolk Heritages
While most lizardfolk prefer wetlands, eons of evolution and cultural
adaptation enable them to live in more challenging environments. Choose
one of the following lizardfolk heritages at 1st level.
Cliffscale Lizardfolk
Your toes are adapted for gripping and climbing. You gain the Combat Climber
feat as a bonus feat, and as long as you aren’t wearing footwear, you can use the
sticky pads on your feet to climb, leaving your hands free. Additionally, if you
roll a success on an Athletics check to climb, you get a critical success instead.
Cloudleaper Lizardfolk
Your body is light with flaps of skin along your limbs that catch the air that
passes beneath you. As long as you can act and have enough room, you can
open the flaps to slow any fall just enough to avoid taking damage (whether
you have the room to do so depends on the GM’s discretion).
Frilled Lizardfolk
You can flare your neck frill and flex your dorsal spines, Demoralizing your foes.
When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and
you don’t take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn’t
understand your language. You also gain the Threatening Approach action.
Threatening Approach [two-actions] Effect You Stride to be adjacent to a foe and Demoralize
that foe. If you succeed, the foe is frightened 2 instead of frightened 1.
Sandstrider Lizardfolk
Your thick scales help you retain water and combat the sun’s glare. You gain fire
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). Environmental heat effects are
one step less extreme for you, and you can go 10 times as long as normal before
you are affected by starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear
or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
Unseen Lizardfolk
You can change your skin color to blend in with your surroundings, making
minor shifts with a single action and dramatic changes over the course of
an hour. When you’re in an area where your coloration is roughly similar
to the environment (for instance, forest green in a forest), you can use the
minor, single-action application of this ability to make localized changes that
help you blend into your surroundings, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks until your surroundings change in coloration or pattern.
Wetlander Lizardfolk
Your family is descended from the most common lizardfolk heritage, and you
are accustomed to aquatic environments. You gain a 15-foot swim Speed.
Woodstalker Lizardfolk
You move easily through thick forest and jungle, using every branch or bush.
You can always use the Take Cover action when in forest or jungle terrain to
gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you would normally be able
to Take Cover behind. You gain the Terrain Stalker feat, even if you’re not
trained in Stealth, and you must choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
Lizardfolk Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a lizardfolk,
you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

Ysoki are beings that most surface-dwelling humanoids
refer to as “ratfolk.” They are a communal people who
prefer cramped conditions, with up to 100 individuals
living in a given home. If they can’t find homes in town,
ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes,
as these provide great storage for the many and varied
goods they bring back from trading expeditions.
Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found
on the road in merchant caravans. They’re good with
their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything
out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They’re
also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed
full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous
generations and stowed away in preparation for some
future emergency.
If you want a character who is smart, fast, welltraveled,
and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!
You might...
- Have pride in your large extended family, and stay
in contact with everyone in it.
- Like to travel near and far in search of new
experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way.
Others probably...
- Are surprised by your careful grooming and other
fastidious habits.
- Think you’re crowding them and invading their
personal space.

## Ratfolk

Physical Description
Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless
tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or
black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs
around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however;
even a single family group can exhibit substantial
variation in hair color, eye color, or size.
Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though
this is also reinforced through their strong social
structures. Because their appearance is often considered
disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even
mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their
physical features with layers of clothing when moving
through spaces dominated by other ancestries.
Society
Ysoki culture values cooperation and community.
Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social
occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and
connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a
long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk
travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons
are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen
vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large
giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals.
Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have
been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes
with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are
often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids
they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and
endure them only when outside their communities.
Sample Names: Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto,
Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak,
Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess
Beliefs
Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract
concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be
chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but
they also obey strict social codes.
Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to
acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area,
Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother
Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to
ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own
interests above others. To most ratfolk,
Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those
things they need done, but which they
would not wish to do.
Popular Edicts put your community’s interests above your own,
maintain a cleanly appearance, be honest in your dealings
Popular Anathema throw away something that might be useful

Ratfolk Heritages
Ratfolk are native to underground regions, but they are a highly adaptable
ancestry that has been found in almost every environment. Choose one of
the following ratfolk heritages at 1st level.
Deep Rat
Your ancestors lived deeper underground than other ratfolk, granting you
the ability to see in the dark. You gain darkvision.
Desert Rat
You are native to arid plains and likely grew up traveling the roads. If you
have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on
all fours. In addition, environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for
you, and you can go 10 times longer than normal before you are affected by
starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter,
environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
Longsnout Rat
Your long snout gives you a keener sense of smell than most ratfolk. You gain
imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense
of smell to determine a creature’s location, as explained on page 433 of the
Player Core. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from
the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to
Seek a creature or object within the range of your scent.
Sewer Rat
You come from a long line of ratfolk with a community based in the sewers
beneath a large settlement. You are immune to the disease putrid plague. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons.
If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get
a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve
the save in this way (such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you
roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.
Shadow Rat
Your ancestors lived in dark spaces underground, granting you dark fur and a
vaguely unnatural mien. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Intimidation
and can use Intimidation to Coerce animals. When you Demoralize an animal,
you don’t take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If you would
automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class,
for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice.
Animals’ attitudes toward you begin one degree worse than normal,
usually starting at unfriendly instead of indifferent for domesticated animals,
and hostile instead of unfriendly for wild animals.
Snow Rat
You have a thicker coat and bulkier frame to defend against the cold,
granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat
environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible
cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Tunnel Rat

Squeeze feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren’t trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces

Ratfolk Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th,
13th, and 17th levels). As a ratfolk, you select from among
the following ancestry feats.

## 1St Level


## Cheek Pouches Feat 1


## Ratfolk

Your cheeks are stretchy, and you can store up to four items of
light Bulk or less in these cheek pouches. None of these items
can have a dimension longer than 1 foot. As long as you have at
least one item in your cheek pouches, your speech is noticeably
difficult to understand. Placing an item in your cheek pouch or
retrieving one is an Interact action. You can empty your mouth
with a single action, causing everything you had stored in your
cheek pouches to fall to the ground in your square.

## Pack Rat Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You’ve learned how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You
can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane
storage containers or vehicles. For example, you can fit 6 Bulk
in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn’t alter the items’
Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or
extradimensional storage space, such as a spacious pouch.

## Rat Familiar Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You have a pet rat that has become magically bonded to you. You
gain a familiar using the rules on page 212 of the Player Core,
and this familiar must be a rat. It still gets the benefits of familiar
abilities, but its base form remains a rat.

## Ratfolk Lore Feat 1


## Ratfolk

Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made
you nimble, and you’ve learned to run and hide when enemies
threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics
and Stealth. If you would automatically become trained in one
of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Ratfolk Lore.

## Ratspeak Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the
Diplomacy skill with rodents, including beavers, mice, porcupines,
rats, and squirrels, but not with other mammals, such as dogs or
bats. The GM determines which animals count as rodents.

## Tinkering Fingers Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You’re trained in Crafting. If you are trained in Crafting from
another source (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can Repair
an item without using a repair toolkit without taking the –2
circumstance penalty, improvising tools from whatever you have
at hand. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to
Repair an item when you have a repair toolkit.

## Vicious Incisors Feat 1


## Ratfolk

Your jaws unarmed attack deals 1d6 piercing damage instead of
1d4, and gains the backstabber trait. You can file down your teeth
and regrow them later on, enabling you to select this feat at any
level, and to retrain into and out of this feat.

## Warren Navigator Feat 1


## Ratfolk

You gain the trained proficiency rank in Survival. If you would
automatically become trained in Survival (from your background
or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your
choice. When you Sense Direction or attempt a roll against a
quandary spell, you get a result one degree of success better than
you rolled. You don’t take a penalty to Sense Direction when you
lack a compass.

## 5Th Level

have been exposed to a wide variety of alchemical poisons and
harmful substances, leaving you with an increased tolerance of
their effects. You have a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against
poisons and diseases. If you roll a success on your saving throw
against a poison or disease, you get a critical success instead.

pouches (provided it fits).

for you. You can cast animal messenger once per day as a primal
innate spell. When you do, the animal that responds is always a
rat. If there are no rats within range, the spell is lost.
### Ratfolk Roll [two-actions] FEAT 5

## Move Ratfolk

You roll up into a ball and move up to four times your Speed in

a straight line down an incline. If you reach the bottom of the
incline or hit an obstacle during this first turn of movement,
you stop rolling safely. Otherwise, you automatically keep
rolling at this Speed during subsequent turns until you hit
the bottom of the incline or an obstacle ends this movement
(which can happen in the middle of your turn). You’re slowed

an obstacle on a turn after the first, you and the obstacle both
take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and you stop rolling.

rat. You gain the effects of a 1st-rank pest
form spell, but you must assume the battle
form of a Tiny rat.

## Uncanny Cheeks Feat 9


## Ratfolk

You gain the Prescient Consumable and Prescient
Planner feats (Player Core 260), except that you
always withdraw the objects from your cheek

fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of
negligible Bulk unless you also have the Cheek Pouches
feat.

## 13Th Level


## Shinstabber Feat 13


## Ratfolk

Prerequisites Overcrowd

You give a shrill whistle and point, and a massive swarm of rats
pours forth from the surrounding terrain to fill a 30-foot burst
within 120 feet. The rats scurry over the ground and climb up
walls and surfaces, biting and clawing as they deal 6d8 piercing
damage to all enemies in the area. The rats continue to swarm
in the area for the next minute, dealing 3d8 piercing damage to
any enemy that ends its turn in the area and transforming the
area into difficult terrain (though the rats allow you and your
allies to pass normally). You can Dismiss the effect.

## Ratfolk

You call upon the familial bonds you share with your allies
and other ratfolk to become an overwhelming force in
battle. You can cast enlarge as a 6th-rank primal
innate spell once per day.

Tengu are survivalists and conversationalists, equally at
home living off the wilderness and finding a niche in dense
cities. They accumulate knowledge, tools, and companions,
adding them to their collection as they travel.
The tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search
of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to
lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengu
notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”—
members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately or
otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a variety of
conditions and locations, tengu tend to be nonjudgmental,
though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has
often led some to regard them with suspicion.
If you want to play a character hailing from a rich history
of artisanship and tradition, but who happily picks up new
practices as needed, you should play a tengu.

## Tengu

You might...
- Be gregarious and eager to find a flock of your own.
- Voraciously absorb the practices of those around you,
sometimes even forgetting where they came from.
Others probably...
- Get confused by your simultaneous respect for and
disregard of tradition.
- Have trouble reading your expressions or regard
you with suspicion and superstition.
Physical Description
Tengu have many avian characteristics. Their faces are tipped
with sharp beaks and their scaled forearms and lower legs
end in talons. As closed footwear tends to fit poorly unless
custom made, many tengu wear open sandals or simply go
barefoot. Tengu are rarely more than 5 feet tall, and they
are even lighter than their smaller frames would suggest, as
they have hollow bones. A small number of tengu have
vestigial wings.
Society
The greatest divide in tengu society is between
tengu remaining in their ancestral home and those
who have dispersed across the world. Tengu refer to
these two groups as those “in the roost” and those
“migrating,” respectively. Roosted tengu tend to be
more traditionalist and conservative and are especially
concerned with preserving their culture in the face of
years of erosion from oppression. Migrating tengu, on
the other hand, voraciously absorb the culture of the
various nations and settlements that they now call home.
Roosted tengu tend toward more traditional names,
while migrating tengu readily absorb and repurpose the
culture of those around them.
Sample Names: Arkkak, Chuko, Dolgra, Dorodara,
Kakkariel, Kora, Marrak, Mossarah, Pularrka, Rarorel,
Ruk, Tak-Tak, Tsukotarra
Beliefs
Tengu often follow the faith of the region in which they
were raised, though the tengu ancestral deity is the storm
god Hei Feng. Before their diaspora, tengu practiced a
syncretic faith that blended a polytheistic worship of
the deities responsible for creating the natural world. As
tengu folklore posits that tengu long ago descended from
the night sky on shooting stars to rest upon Golarion’s
highest peaks, animist rites were practiced on mountains
and other great natural features.
Popular Edicts protect tengu traditions, adopt the lessons of
other cultures, seek out natural wonders
Popular Anathema lose control of your emotions

Tengu Heritages
As a fluid people scattered from their original homes, there are a wide variety
of tengu on Golarion. Choose one of the following tengu heritages at 1st level.
Dogtooth Tengu
In addition to a beak, your mouth also features a number of vicious, pointed
teeth. Some legends claim your powerful jaws can even bite through steel.
While you aren’t that strong yet, your fangs can still leave terrible wounds.
Your beak unarmed attack gains the deadly d8 trait.
Jinxed Tengu
Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now they slide off
your feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or
misfortune effect, you get a critical success instead. When you would gain
the doomed condition, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, reduce the
value of the doomed condition you would gain by 1.
Mountainkeeper Tengu
You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits
of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the vitality lash cantrip as
a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to
half your level rounded up. Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage
or ancestry feat, you can decide whether it’s a divine or primal spell.
Skyborn Tengu
Your bones may be especially light, you may be a rare tengu with wings,
or your connection to the spirits of wind and sky might be stronger than
most, slowing your descent through the air. You take no damage from falling,
regardless of the distance you fall.
Stormtossed Tengu
Whether due to a blessing from Hei Feng or hatching from your egg during
a squall, you are resistant to storms. You gain electricity resistance equal to
half your level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the flat check to
target a concealed creature if that creature is concealed only by rain or fog.
Taloned Tengu
Your talons are every bit as sharp and strong as your beak. You gain a talons
unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your talons are in the
brawling group and have the agile, finesse, unarmed, and versatile P traits.
Wavediver Tengu
You’re one of the rare tengu who can cut through water like a bird through
air, and you often lurk in rivers or oceans where few expect you. You gain a
swim Speed of 15 feet.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a tengu,

critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are
temporarily immune for 24 hours.

the electric arc cantrip as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip

## Tengu

You learned skills for surviving in the place where your people

and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one

You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Tengu Lore.
### Tengu Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 1

## Tengu

as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as

### Eat Fortune [reaction] FEAT 5

## Concentrate Divine Tengu

Frequency once per day
Trigger A creature within 60 feet uses a fortune or misfortune
effect.
As someone tries to twist fate, you consume the interference.
The triggering effect is disrupted. If it’s a misfortune effect,
Eat Fortune gains the fortune trait; if it’s a fortune effect, Eat
Fortune gains the misfortune trait. This fortune or misfortune
applies to the same roll the triggering effect would have, so
you couldn’t negate a fortune effect with Eat Fortune and then
apply a misfortune effect to the same roll.
### Long-Nosed Form [one-action] FEAT 5

## Concentrate Polymorph Primal Tengu

You transform into a specific, curious-looking human form. This
human form is the same age and body type as your tengu form
and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as height, though
your nose remains as long as your beak and your complexion
has red undertones, no matter the skin color of your human
form. Using Long-Nosed Form counts as creating a disguise
for the Impersonate use of Deception. Due to your imperfect
transformation, your transformation doesn’t automatically defeat
Perception DCs to determine whether you are human, though
you may be able to explain away or hide your tengu traits.
You lose your beak unarmed Strike in your human form, as
well as any other unarmed Strikes you gained from a tengu
heritage or ancestry feat. You remain in your human form
indefinitely, until you Dismiss this effect.

fly Speed of 20 feet for this movement. If you aren’t on solid
ground at the end of this movement, you fall.
### Tengu Feather Fan [one-action] FEAT 5

## Tengu

You’ve learned to bind some of your feathers together into a

fan to focus your ancestral magic. You gain a tengu feather
fan: a magic item of light Bulk with a level equal to your level
and the primal trait. You (and only you) can cast tengu magic
with the Wave Fan activation. If your fan is lost or destroyed,
you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if
you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers.
Your tengu feather fan contains a 1st-rank gust of wind spell.
Further feats might add more spells and grant you additional
activations of your tengu feather fan, but you can never have
more than three activations per day, no matter how many such
feats you have.
Activate—Wave Fan (manipulate) Frequency once per day;
Effect You cast your choice of one spell contained in your
tengu feather fan. You can instead cast a cantrip you’ve
gained from a heritage or an ancestry feat; this doesn’t use
up one of the fan’s daily activations.
This activation takes the spell’s normal number of actions.
The spell’s DC is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

lightning bolt spell to the spells contained within your fan.

## 17Th Level

### Great Tengu Form  FEAT 17

## Tengu

Prerequisites Long-Nosed Form
You take on the imposing form of a large, winged spirit. Once
per day, as part of using Long-Nosed Form, you also gain the
benefits of 4th-rank enlarge and fly. This lasts for 5 minutes
or until you shift out of your Long-Nosed Form, whichever
happens first.

## Trickster Tengu Feat 17

your displeasure. Once per day, you can cast either aerial form
or cursed metamorphosis as a 7th-rank primal innate spell. You

35

Tripkees are a shy and cautious people who generally seek
to avoid being drawn into the affairs of others. Despite
their cautious outlook and small stature, adventurous
tripkees still take bold and noble action when the situation
demands it.
Tripkees are reclusive treetop survivalists who harvest
their homes’ bounty, utilizing their canopy homes as
natural fortifications against the threats posed by larger
predators. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools
has led to tripkees often being mischaracterized as
rudimentary, though this does poor justice to their skill
in the cultivation of hidden orchards and camouflaged
causeways tucked away in treetop nations. Tripkees are
most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade,
explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.
If you want a character who is small in stature but
large in spirit, and possesses qualities of a tree frog, you
should play a tripkee.
You might…
- Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment
when overcoming challenges.
- Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales
of exploitative strangers.
Others probably...
- Trust in your impartial, measured approach to
understanding situations and solving problems.
- Give you space, fearing that touching you would
prove toxic.

## Tripkee

Physical Description
Tripkees resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes,
wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames
and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing,
while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage
that varies by their home environment—green and brown
for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian
communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee
grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2
feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they’re
only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely
live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals
occasionally live as long as a century.
Society
Tripkees lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle
within which they reshape the landscape to suit their
needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing
trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and
more techniques that often escape an agriculturist’s eye.
These strategies rely on community cooperation as well
as dispersed populations, so tripkees commonly live in
small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and
relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved tripkee lives and
lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves
threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike.
Tripkee names often include resonant vowels and
chirped consonants that remain difficult for nontripkees
to vocalize properly. Tripkees that travel widely
often adopt one or more names more easily replicated
by their associates.
Sample Names: Aalpo’ol, Bogwynne, Ctaprak, Eegru,
Gpoun, Gruoksh, Hrrauti, Iopo, Iykiki, Kyrsiik, Mhruugu,
Oplugo, Quaasol, Yolkuu, Ztaal
Beliefs
Taught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes
of life and death, many tripkees adopt patient attitudes.
Those who take a more active role suppressing cruelty
may join organizations that blend religion and philosophy,
such as the tripkee fiend-keepers who absorb an unholy
being into their soul to contain and eventually transform
its villainy through their own virtuous acts. Nature deities
like Gozreh or Erastil often earn tripkees’ respect, yet
communities usually prefer less prominent, more intimate
divinities such as empyreal lords, psychopomp ushers, or
the fey Eldest.
Popular Edicts improve your part of the world without causing
harm to others, practice patience whenever possible
Popular Anathema create architecture that supplants
the natural world, take rash action that brings risk to
your community

Tripkee Heritages
Choose one of the following tripkee heritages at 1st level.
Poisonhide Tripkee
You may be small, but the poison glands concealed across your body hide a
deadly defense. You gain the Toxic Skin reaction.
Toxic Skin [reaction] (poison) Frequency once per hour; Trigger A creature touches you, such as
by Grappling you, successfully hitting you with an unarmed attack, or using a touchrange
spell against you; Effect You exude a deadly toxin. The triggering creature takes
1d4 poison damage (basic Fortitude save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is
higher). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.
Riverside Tripkee
Your ancestors live in and on the water. You gain a 15-foot swim Speed.
Snaptongue Tripkee
Your tongue is especially long, and you can launch it with extraordinary
range and precision. You can use your tongue to deliver spells with a range
of touch and perform extremely simple Interact actions, such as opening
some types of unlocked doors. Your tongue can’t perform actions that
require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that
would require a check to accomplish, and you can’t use it to hold items.
Stickytoe Tripkee
Your hands and feet exude a film that helps them adhere to surfaces. You gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DC against attempts
to Disarm, Shove, Reposition, or Trip you. When ascending trees, vines, and
other foliage, if you roll a success on the Athletics check to Climb, you get a
critical success instead.
Thickskin Tripkee
Your thick leathery skin resembles that of a toad. You gain 8 Hit Points
from your ancestry instead of 6. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves
against diseases and poisons.
Windweb Tripkee
Tough webbing along your hands and toes can slow any fall. As long as you have
one hand free, you take no falling damage, regardless of the distance you fall.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a tripkee,
you select from among the following ancestry feats.

## 1St Level


## Croak Talker Feat 1


## Tripkee

You can communicate with the simplest of frogs and other similar creatures using longwinded
croaks. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy
skill with animals that are amphibians (most amphibians have the amphibious trait).

## Traits

Tripkee
Humanoid

## Low-Light Vision

You can see in dim light as though it

## Natural Climber

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Athletics checks to Climb.

37

Trigger A creature with the animal, beast, elemental, fey, fungus,
or plant trait attacks you, and you can see the attacker.
Your canny understanding of natural and primal creatures
helps you predict and dodge their attacks. The triggering
attack roll targets your Nature DC instead of your AC. Though
this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t
remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties.
For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra
damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn’t
take the –2 circumstance penalty against the attack.

## Jungle Strider Feat 1


## Tripkee

You are adept at dodging roots, foliage, and other jungle
obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain in forests and jungles.
In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on
narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of plant material, you

The most common versatile heritages by far are those
born from the pairing of two different ancestries, such
as the aiuvarin and dromaar mixed heritages (Player
Core 82). Other individuals are born under far stranger
circumstances, such as having a parent who was affected
by monstrous, undead, or extraplanar energies. As these
circumstances aren’t unique to a single ancestry, these
heritages are likewise shared by many ancestries.
Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages.
Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through
specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many,
however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy,
whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors,
or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that
plane. These individuals are known as planar scions.
Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile
heritages aren’t limited to a single ancestry, a versatile
heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any
ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common
among certain ancestries than others, and some might list
additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM
may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use
a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting.
Playing a Versatile
Heritage
To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select
your ancestry, just like you would for any character.
You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and
attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from
that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from
those normally available to that ancestry, apply your
chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from
your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or
replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry.
Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have
only one, and you can’t have any other heritage in
addition to your versatile heritage.
Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an
ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry.
In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting
abilities your character has.
When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from
those available to your ancestry as well as those specific
to your versatile heritage.
Lineage Feats
Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have the
lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological lineage
your character has—such as the type of vampire that
birthed a dhampir character, or the type of dragon that
influenced a dragonblood’s birth. You can have only
one lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at
1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out of this feat.
Roleplaying a Versatile Heritage
As most versatile heritages are
uncommon or rare, playing
a character with a versatile
heritage generally offers unique and sometimes
challenging roleplaying opportunities. The origins of
a character’s versatile heritage immediately offers a
The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or dabbling
with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul. The children born to
such parents might have traits from each of their parents or physiological manifestations of
the forces their ancestors were influenced by, manifesting as a specific heritage. For more
information about versatile heritages, see pages 74–75 of Player Core.

## Versatile Heritages



## Dhampir

strong chance to create an interesting and compelling
background for your character. While obvious events
related to a character’s birth, such as having unique
parentage, offer explanations for a character’s versatile
heritage, this might also be a good opportunity to create
an even more personalized explanation for the heritage.
For example, a dhampir character could have
been born due to long-term exposure to void energy,
transforming the character before birth. A dragonblood
character might have earned the blessing of a powerful
dragon at some point during their adult life, changing
the character into a dragonblood far later than usual.
The circumstances—well-known or otherwise—of a
duskwalker’s death could be full of interesting story
potential. Players of characters with versatile heritages
are encouraged to work with their GMs and fellow
players to create interesting origin ideas without
monopolizing the spotlight at the table.
A versatile heritage can influence not only a character’s
origins, but also their outlook and personality. The
nature of a versatile heritage causes a character to
stand out among most cultures and societies. In many
cases, a versatile heritage might isolate a character.
This can manifest in distrust of the character’s origins,
an unhealthy fixation with the character, or any other
unfortunately othering responses from strangers. The
isolation that comes from these reactions could cause a
character to become bitter or withdrawn.
The nature of the versatile heritage could also lead
to the character having to “live in two worlds.” A
character of mixed ancestry heritage might need to learn
two different sets of cultures and societal expectations.
Learning to navigate these expectations can come with
its own roleplaying challenges.
Of course, players who would rather ignore all of these
roleplaying opportunities and challenges are encouraged
to do so as well. Roleplaying a character should be a
rewarding and exciting experience overall, and removing
these additional aspects is perfectly reasonable.
In This Book
This book includes the rules for three versatile heritages.
Dhampir
The mortal offspring of undead vampires are
caught between life and undeath, mortality and
immortality, mundane existence and powerful
magic. Dhampirs enjoy long life spans
and otherworldly charm, but their
ghostly pallor and the nature of their
parentage make their lives in humanoid
societies difficult.
The two lineages for dhampirs found
here are svetochers, who come from the most
common vampires called moroi, and straveikas, born
of aged and unsettling nosferatus.
Dragonblood
While there are many ways a mortal can be imbued with
draconic powers, dragonbloods have an inherent natural
affinity. Children born of draconic lineage or blessed by
a dragon deity find themselves skirting the line of mortal
and dragon, often taking on draconic appearances and
boasting strong personalities.
The four lineages for dragonbloods found here are
represented by the traditions of magic from which a
dragon is born.
Planar Scions: Duskwalker
A duskwalker isn’t born; they are instead created, each
manifesting as a mortal child in a location with close ties to
death. They embody the somber powers of the psychopomps,
immortal guardians and shepherds of the dead, and they
maintain a fascination with and deep understanding of death
throughout their lives. More singular than other versatile
heritages, duskwalkers don’t have different lineages.

41


## Duskwalker

Many call vampires the children of the night, but it’s
dhampirs who can truly claim that title. These mortal
offspring of vampires walk the line between life and
undeath not just physiologically, but also in their
social standing, temperament, and worldview. The
circumstances surrounding a dhampir’s birth are rare,
complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors. Some
dhampirs are the child of one mortal and one vampiric
parent, while others are born to those who were turned
into vampires while pregnant. Still others rise from
occult rituals or other supernatural influences that
impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant. The life
of a dhampir is often difficult; few vampiric parents
have the inclination to raise a mortal child, while mortal
communities find a dhampir’s sallow flesh, piercing eyes,
and unnerving presence off-putting at best.

## Dhampir

Despite being living creatures, dhampirs respond to
vitality and void energy as if they were undead, making
them unwelcome in many holy communities and often
driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs aren’t
immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals,
with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have
difficulty producing children of their own, and those few
born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves.
A dhampir generally resembles a member of their nonvampire
parent’s ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and
eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and
no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly
as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace,
beauty, and charm despite their unsettling appearance.
You might...
- Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to
blend into society or even hunting undead.
- Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to
“helpful” healing magic.
- Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste
of blood.
Others probably...
- Feel unsettled by your ghostly pallor and sharp teeth.
- Wonder about or even romanticize your origins
and motivations.
- Find themselves strangely drawn to your grace,
charm, and appearance.
Dhampir (Uncommon Heritage)
You are the scion of a vampire, half living and half
undead, gifted with uncanny charm and grace, a bloodless
pallor, and elongated incisors. You gain the dhampir trait,
in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You have
the void healing ability, which means you are harmed
by vitality damage and healed by void effects as if you
were undead. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain
darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision.
You can select from dhampir feats and feats from your
ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Dhampir Feats
The following feats are available to dhampir characters.
Lineages
Dhampir can select any of the following lineages.

## Straveika Feat 1


## Dhampir Lineage

You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu

powers of domination have left you with an understanding of
how a creature’s intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive and
Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you.

of targets at 4th and 8th rank.

## Necromantic Physiology Feat 5


## Dhampir

Your unusual physiology has developed in a way that makes it
difficult for parasites and other infestations to prey upon you.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against
diseases. If you roll a success on a saving throw against
a disease, you get a critical success instead. If you have a
different ability that would improve the save in this way
(such as the battle hardened fighter class feature), if you roll a
critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.

## Undead Slayer Feat 5


## Dhampir

Your knowledge of your own not-quite-living anatomy,
combined with your experience in combat, helps you take
down undead foes with ease. Against undead creatures,
you gain a circumstance bonus to damage with weapon and

for the Strike. This bonus increases to double the number of
weapon damage dice if your target has the vampire trait.

## 9Th Level


## Bloodletting Fangs Feat 9

Dragons are powerful creatures, and many have
involved themselves deeply in the lives of others. Some
might be treated with reverence by a group of smaller
humanoids, acting as their protector or, in rare cases,
deity incarnate. Others take on a humanoid form to live
within a civilization as their neighbors’ equal, sometimes
hiding their true identity to observe or manipulate.
Whatever the dragon’s intent or actions during these
times, they leave an indelible impression on the people
they encounter, whether or not those people realize it. A
child may be born as the result of such an influence, and
these offspring are known as dragonbloods.
A dragonblood may be born from any ancestry and
found in just about any region of Golarion, as dragons
tend to go where they please. Some dragonbloods possess
obvious draconic traits, from clawed hands to leathery
wings to a mighty reptilian tail; these features always
resemble similar aspects of the dragonblood’s draconic
forebear. For instance, the scion of an adamantine

## Dragonblood

dragon might have thick, plate-like scales on their chest.
Other dragonbloods more closely resemble dragons than
the other half of their heritage, leading many to mistake
them for kobolds, iruxis, or other reptilian ancestries;
such dragonbloods who are proud of their draconic
lineage are quick to point out this mistake. There are
also those dragonbloods whose outward appearances
suggest only a hint of dragon blood. They might have
a barely noticeable sheen to their skin or the small
nubs of horns, but they often have an outsized force of
personality or innate magical abilities.
Areas in which dragons have more influence or cultural
significance see a higher population of dragonbloods
than other places. The countries of Tian Xia are often
referred to as the Dragon Empires due to the fact that
many dragons take active roles in local humanoid
societies. A leader in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings
who takes on a curse from killing a linnorm might
find that the eyes of their next offspring glow with an
eldritch light. Communities that pay homage to the
dragon gods Apsu or Dahak can also be blessed with
dragonblood births.
You might...
- Consider yourself quite courageous due to the
influence of your draconic heritage.
- Revel in the deference some other ancestries pay to
you and your ilk.
- Feel a burden of responsibility to live
up to the legacy of your ancestors.
Others probably...
- Believe you are in a dragon’s employ or are a dragon
in disguise and want you to reveal the location of
some treasure.
- Assume you can breathe fire or some other element.
- Mistakenly think touching your scales, horns, or
wings will bring them good luck.
Dragonblood (Uncommon Heritage)
You’re descended in some way from a dragon. Your
physical features might show this outwardly, with a pair
of draconic horns, patches of scaly skin, or even a tail, or
you might develop an internal reserve of draconic power.
You gain the dragonblood trait, in addition to the traits
from your ancestry. Add Draconic to your ancestry’s
list of additional languages (allowing you to choose
it as a language if your Intelligence modifier is
positive). When you roll a success on a saving throw
against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.
You can choose from dragonblood feats and feats from
your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

Dragonblood Feats
The following feats are available to dragonblood characters.
Lineages
Dragonblood can select any of the following lineages.
You can have only one lineage feat; you can select such
a feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out
of this feat.

## Arcane Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

You descend from a dragon that wields mastery of their
magical abilities, such as a fortune dragon or mirage dragon.
As such, you can instinctively grasp the intricacies of magic.
You gain the trained proficiency rank in Arcana. If you would
automatically become trained in Arcana (from your background
or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of
your choice. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. If you choose
a draconic exemplar, you must choose an arcane dragon.

## Divine Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

You can trace your lineage to a dragon with almost deific
powers, such as a diabolic dragon or empyreal dragon. You
are blessed with a small bit of divine protection. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Religion. If you would automatically
become trained in Religion (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
In addition, you are endowed quick reactions. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to initiative rolls. If you choose a draconic
exemplar, you must choose a divine dragon.

## Occult Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

Your blood contains a tiny fragment of unusual or inexplicable
power from a mysterious dragon, such as a conspirator dragon
or omen dragon. You are drawn to the stranger parts of the
world and can generally spot them with a glance. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Occultism. If you would automatically
become trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat. If you choose a
draconic exemplar, you must choose an occult dragon.

## Primal Dragonblood Feat 1


## Dragonblood Lineage

A dragon with a deep connection to the natural world, such as
an adamantine dragon or a horned dragon, resides somewhere
on your family tree. You tend to trust your instincts and might
take on the role of a protector of the wilderness. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Nature. If you would automatically
become trained in Nature (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You can use Nature to Sense Direction and Subsist in the
wilds. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose a
primal dragon.

## 1St Level

### Breath Of The Dragon [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Dragonblood Magical

Tapping into the physiology of your draconic ancestor, you
can exhale a torrent of energy in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot
line, dealing 1d4 damage. Each creature in the area must
attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your
class DC or spell DC. You can’t use this ability again for
1d4 rounds.
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage
increases by 1d4. The shape of the breath, the damage type,
and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar
(see above). This ability has the trait associated with the type
of damage it deals.

## Draconic Aspect Feat 1


## Dragonblood

You have an obvious draconic feature, such as sharp claws, a
snout full of sharp teeth, or strong reptilian tail, that you can
use offensively. You gain your choice of one of the following
unarmed attacks. The attack is in the brawling group and has
the listed damage die and traits.
- Claw 1d4 slashing (agile, finesse, unarmed)
- Jaws 1d6 piercing (forceful, unarmed)
- Tail 1d6 bludgeoning (sweep, trip, unarmed)
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat, nor can you change the type
of attack you gained.

## Draconic Exemplars

Some abilities reference your draconic exemplar, which is a
specific type of dragon from which you draw your draconic
powers—typically the type of dragon whose blood runs
in your veins. You can choose your exemplar when you
create your character, but are only required to choose one
when you select a feat or other option that requires you to
have one (such as Breath of the Dragon). This means your
draconic nature might be a mystery to you for some time.
The table below lists the dragons from Monster Core
and their specifications. The dragon breath entry lists if the
given breath uses a Fortitude (F), Reflex (R), or Will (W) saving
throw. If you choose a dragon from a different source, work
with your GM to determine if you have access to it.
Dragon Tradition Speeds Dragon Breath
Adamantine Primal Burrow Cone of bludgeoning R
Conspirator Occult Climb Cone of poison F
Diabolic Divine — Cone of fire R
Empyreal Divine — Cone of spirit R
Fortune Arcane — Cone of force R
Horned Primal Swim Cone of poison F
Mirage Arcane Climb Cone of mental W

## Draconic Resistance Feat 1


## Dragonblood

Draconic magic safeguards you against harm. You gain
resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage
type associated with your draconic exemplar. Double this
resistance against damage of that type dealt to you by dragons.

piercing, or slashing damage, instead of gaining resistance to
that type you can choose acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic.

## Draconic Sight Feat 1

You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already grants you low-light vision.

You’ve set your mind on learning more about your ancestor
and their kin, and perhaps you were even raised by a dragon
parent. You’ve come to understand how dragons can invoke
fear but also how they’ve contributed to society as a whole.
You gain the trained proficiency rank in Diplomacy and
Intimidation. If you would automatically become trained
in one of those skills (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your
choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for Dragon Lore.

## Scaly Hide Feat 1


## Dragonblood

You were born with a layer of scales across your entire body
that resemble those of your draconic progenitor. When you’re
unarmored, the scales give you a +2 item bonus to AC with a
Dexterity cap of +3. The item bonus to AC from these scales
is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer’s
clothing, the mystic armor spell, or bands of force (GM Core 286).

retrain into or out of this feat.

magic. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saves against spells
and other magical effects from the same tradition as your lineage.

## Arcane Dragonblood


## 9Th Level


## Formidable Breath Feat 9


## Dragonblood

Prerequisites Breath of the Dragon
Thanks to rigorous breathing exercises and a diet similar to that
of your lineage, your magical breath is more powerful. The area
of your Breath of the Dragon increases to 30 feet for a cone or
60 feet for a line, and the damage dice are d6s instead of d4s.
TRUE DRAGON’S FLIGHT FEAT 9

## Dragonblood

Prerequisites Dragon’s Flight
Your wings have grown more powerful, capable of keeping
you aloft longer. You have a fly Speed of 20 feet at all times.
### Wing Buffet [two-actions] FEAT 9

## Attack Dragonblood

Prerequisites expert in Athletics
You have a pair of draconic wings strong enough to batter your
foes away and shove them away. Choose up to two creatures
adjacent to you. Attempt an Athletics check and compare it to
the Fortitude DC of each target. This counts as two attacks for
your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase
until after both attacks.
Critical Success The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to
double your level and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.
Success The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your
level and is pushed up to 5 feet away from you.
Failure The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half
your level.
Critical Failure You fall prone at the end of this activity.

## 13Th Level


## Draconic Veil Feat 13


## Dragonblood

Like some dragons, your forebear had the supernatural
ability to change their shape to walk among humanoids.
You have learned how to mimic this ability. You can cast
humanoid form as a 5th-rank innate spell once per day,
except that the duration is increased to 1 hour. The
spell’s tradition matches your draconic exemplar’s.
### Majestic Presence [one-action] FEAT 13
### Dragonblood Emotion Fear Mental Visual
By taking an impressive stance, the full force of your
personality cows lesser beings. Each creature in a 20-
foot emanation must attempt a Will save against the
higher of your class DC or spell DC. Regardless of the
result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily
immune to your Majestic Presence for 24 hours.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 4.

## 17Th Level

### Form Of The Dragon  FEAT 17

## Dragonblood

You can briefly transform into a paragon of your draconic
ancestry. You can cast dragon form as an 8th-rank innate spell
once per day. This spell has the same tradition as your draconic
exemplar. When you cast this innate spell, you must transform
into your draconic exemplar. However, if you have the Arcane
Dragonblood, Divine Dragonblood, Occult Dragonkin, or Primal
Dragonblood lineage feat, you can instead choose any dragon
of that tradition.

## Lingering Breath Feat 17


## Dragonblood

Prerequisites Breath of the Dragon
Your draconic breath destroys the surrounding environment
and leaves your enemies in pain. When you use Breath of
the Dragon, the area of your breath becomes difficult terrain
for 1 minute. In addition, a creature who fails or critically
fails its saving throw takes 2d6 persistent damage of the
same type.

## Divine Dragonblood

The first duskwalkers manifested as the result of a
bargain between two powerful psychopomps, the
immortal guardians and guides of souls after death. One
believed that souls who helped preserve the cycle of life
and death—but had their own lives cut short—deserved
reincarnation, while the other felt this would too greatly
violate that same cycle. In the end, duskwalkers rose
from a concession between the two psychopomps: such
rebirths could occur, but in limited frequency. Only a
finite number of duskwalkers ever exist at any one point
in time.
When a duskwalker perishes and faces final judgment,
a new one incarnates within a year from a deserving soul,
typically somewhere far from the previous duskwalker’s
birthplace. Duskwalkers manifest in locations with
a sanctified connection to death, such as graveyards

## Duskwalker

or temples, and begin their lives at adolescence. No
duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological
children, but this doesn’t prevent them from establishing
families, typically through adoption.
Duskwalkers have an inherent understanding of the
cycle of life and death. In most cases this manifests as a
deep respect for that cycle and pushes the duskwalker
toward occupations that help them to protect it, such as
hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.
You might...
- Seek out opportunities to form strong friendships
with a diverse array of companions.
- Become focused on preventing the spread of undeath.
- Be intrigued at finding your identity in a previous life.
Others probably...
- Assume you’re a necromancer or have some other
strange interest in death or the dead.
- Want to know if you remember your past life or ask
you about the secrets of death or the afterlife.
Duskwalker (Uncommon Heritage)
Thanks to an ancient bargain, your soul has been reborn
as a duskwalker, a planar scion with a connection to
psychopomps and the Boneyard. You gain the duskwalker
trait. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision
if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your
body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can
select from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry
whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Duskwalker Feats
The following feats are available to duskwalker characters.

## 1St Level

### Chance Death [reaction] FEAT 1

## Duskwalker Fortune

Frequency once per day
Trigger You would die as a result of a failed recovery check or
saving throw.
Your previous life ended due to sheer poor luck, struck
by lightning or choking on a fish bone. You can reroll the
triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you must use
the new result, even if it’s worse.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat.
### Deliberate Death [reaction] FEAT 1

## Duskwalker

Frequency once per day

Trigger You are about to gain the dying condition as a result
of another creature’s attack or ability, and that creature is
within your melee reach.
Once, you died because someone—murderer, monster, or soldier—
chose to strike you down. Just before losing consciousness,
make a melee Strike against the triggering creature.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat.

## Duskwalker Lore Feat 1


## Duskwalker

You either found another duskwalker who taught you the
secrets of your kind, or you managed to research your unusual
heritage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Medicine and
Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one of
those skills (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You also gain the Additional Lore general feat for
Boneyard Lore.
### Duskwalker Weapon Familiarity  FEAT 1

## Duskwalker

You have familiarity with the bo staff, longbow, composite
longbow, scythe, and staff—for the purpose of proficiency,
you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple
weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial
weapons.
At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with one of
these weapons, you get its critical specialization effect.

## Ghost Hunter Feat 1


## Duskwalker

Your connection to the Boneyard ensures that your blows
strike true against spectral beings. Your weapon and unarmed
Strikes against incorporeal creatures become magical. If they
are already magical, they instead gain the effects of a ghost
touch property rune.

## Gravesight Feat 1


## Duskwalker

You can see in the darkness as easily as a psychopomp. You
gain darkvision.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain into or out of this feat.

## 5Th Level


## Lifesense Feat 5


## Divine Duskwalker

You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your
psychopomp forebears. You gain lifesense as an imprecise
sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the
life force of living and undead creatures within the listed
range. The sense can distinguish between the vitality energy
animating living creatures and the void energy animating
undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.

## Spirit Soother Feat 5


## Duskwalker

You are attuned to the minute sounds and sensations of
restless spirits. Even if you aren’t Searching, you can attempt
a check to find haunts that normally require you to be
Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to
find the haunt. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks
to disable haunts.
### Ward Against Corruption  FEAT 5

## Duskwalker

Your soul is warded against the power of undeath and plague,
as well as that of the evil former psychopomps known as
sahkils. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against death effects, disease, and all effects from undead
or sahkils. This bonus increases to +2 against an undead or
sahkil’s death effect or disease.

## 9Th Level


## Duskwalker Magic Feat 9


## Duskwalker

Your connection to psychopomps gives you the power to
glimpse the near future and protect corpses from the ravages
of undeath. You can cast augury and peaceful rest each once
per day as 2nd-rank divine innate spells.

## Quietus Strikes Feat 9


## Duskwalker

Your connection to the Boneyard empowers you to bring death
to all forms of life and unlife, exploiting their weaknesses.
All your weapon and unarmed Strikes are magical and deal
1 additional void damage to living creatures and 1 additional
vitality damage to undead. The extra damage increases to 2 if
the Strike has a +3 potency rune.

## 13Th Level


## Resist Ruin Feat 13


## Duskwalker

Your duskwalker heritage allows you to extend protection
against void energy. You gain resistance 5 to void, and once
per day, you can cast false vitality as a 5th-rank divine
innate spell.

## 17Th Level


## Boneyard’S Call Feat 17


## Uncommon Duskwalker

You have a powerful connection to the Boneyard and its
courts, granting you the ability to travel to and from the
Boneyard. You can cast interplanar teleport as a divine innate
spell twice per week. This can be used only to travel to the
Boneyard or from the Boneyard to the Universe. Due to your
unique connection to the Boneyard, your body serves as the
locus, and you don’t require a planar key.

The following common backgrounds supplement those
found in Player Core and are available to any character
during character creation. Some of these backgrounds
grant skill feats from Chapter 4 of this book.

## Astrologer Background

Astrologers look to the stars for signs and portents, using
their positions in the heavens to chart courses for those living
beneath them. As the celestial spheres move, so does fate itself.
You studied the stars and learned to divine your path based on
their guidance. Whether the stars directly called you to a life of
adventure or you use the stars to guide your wanderlust, you’re
living out the stars’ guidance in a life of adventure.

skill. You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat.

## Barber Background

steady hand and a razor, you can do it. You may have taken to
the road to expand your skills or test yourself against a world
that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Surgery Lore
skill. You gain the Risky Surgery skill feat (page 233).

You ran the numbers on a large farm, for a merchant’s endeavors,
or with a major guild in the city. You kept track of expenses,
payroll, profits, and anything else that had to do with money,
for better or worse. If better, you might be adventuring to learn
how others ply this trade. If worse, you may be fleeing from
impending consequences in the hope that no one finds you.

Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Accounting Lore
skill. You gain the Eye for Numbers skill feat (page 230).

training for the life of an adventurer.

Intelligence, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Lore skill for your
city of origin. You gain the Glean Contents skill feat (page 231).

also provides a number of abilities.

## Common Backgrounds

handle just about anything the road, waves, and sky can throw
at you. You likely adventure to test your skills in unusual

Dexterity, and one is a free attribute boost.

you on this new journey to trumpet your glory... or to escape
the consequences of your defeat.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Warfare Lore
skill. You gain the Lengthy Diversion skill feat.

Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Nature skill and the Plains Lore skill.
You gain the Express Rider skill feat (page 230).

patron deity. You gain the Pilgrim’s Token skill feat (page 232).

to those who need it most.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and a Lore skill related to
the settlement you came from. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.

Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.

for the settlement you grew up scavenging in.

engendering their trust as one of the confidantes of
the household. You might have walked away on good
terms, or perhaps you know dangerous secrets about
your former employers. Regardless, you’re adventuring
for a change and finding that in this new role, the skills you’ve
learned now serve you.

Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Labor Lore skill.
You gain the Read Lips skill feat.

## Squire Background

You’re trained in the Athletics skill and your choice of the
Heraldry Lore or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Armor Assist

seemed the next logical step to you.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Strength or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Lore skill
for the settlement that employed you. You gain the Quick

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and the Genealogy
Lore skill. You gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat.

## Tax Collector'S Tools

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly
different roleplaying experience by setting their character
up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. Whether
a character with the royalty background is heir to the
throne of the kingdom where your campaign takes place
or to a distant but powerful nation in the same world,
the character is situated in a special position within the
narrative. Your character’s background is an intrinsic
part of where they come from and not something they
earn during the game. Rare backgrounds should be
chosen only after a discussion between the GM and
the other players as to whether one would apply for a
particular character in your group’s game.
Backgrounds can also be unique, such that no other
character can have them if your character does. To create
unique backgrounds, you can adapt the rare backgrounds
in this section by including more specific details.

## Amnesiac Background


## Rare

Your background is... well... honestly, you can’t remember! You
might have inklings deep within your mind, undercurrents of
unusual emotions or unexpected responses to certain people
or situations, but ultimately you don’t know who you once
were. You might be adventuring specifically to help discover
yourself. It’s up to you and the GM how to handle the truth of
your character’s backstory. You could leave it to the GM so it’s
a secret, work together with the GM, or even choose to leave
it undecided until later. In any case, you and your GM should
determine a few noteworthy details about your character or
their belongings to get the first clues to your past.
You gain three free attribute boosts. You choose two, and
the GM chooses the third based on their first inklings of your
character’s possible history.

## Blessed Background


## Rare

You have been blessed by a divinity. For an unknown reason,
and irrespective of your actual beliefs, a deity has granted
you a boon to use for good or ill. Your blessing grants wisdom
and insight to aid you in your struggles. You may or may not
even know the identity of the being who blessed you, and the
blessing might come with a cost you discover later on.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in a Lore skill associated with the deity who
blessed you (such as Shelyn Lore) if you know their identity,
or else in a Lore skill of the GM’s choice if you don’t. Either you
can cast guidance as a divine innate spell at will, or you gain a
similar blessing determined by the GM.
While most backgrounds are available to any character, some backgrounds are so unusual
that just having them makes a character rare and extraordinary.

## Rare Backgrounds


## Cursed Background


## Rare

You are the victim of a personal or hereditary curse. Through
great effort and occult study, you have learned to fend off
the curse’s worst effects and, by extension, you can protect
yourself against other harmful magic. However, the curse still
hangs over you and sometimes manifests in dangerous ways.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Occultism and Curse Lore. You gain the
Warding Sign reaction. You and the GM should determine the
full effects of the curse, though you’ve staved most of them off
for now. The GM determines the curse’s lingering manifestations
on you, which usually include at least a constant or very
frequent thematic effect and occasional more dangerous effects.
Warding Sign [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per minute;
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect,
but you haven’t rolled yet; Effect You call on the power of
a personal, eldritch sign of protection, which flares brightly
before slowly fading. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
the triggering saving throw, or a +3 circumstance bonus if
the effect is a curse.

## Feral Child Background


## Rare

You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps
raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with
these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though
this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.
Choose one attribute boost. It must be to Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution.
You are trained in Nature and Survival. You gain low-light vision
(or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise scent
with a range of 30 feet, and the Forager skill feat.

## Feybound Background


## Rare

You have spent time in the First World or another realm of
the fey and aren’t entirely the same person you were before.
Perhaps you made a purchase at the legendary Witchmarket
or partook deeply of fey food and wine. Whatever the case,
willingly or inadvertently, you made a bargain with the fey, the
benefits of which come at a price.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Fey Lore and gain the Fey’s Fortune free
action. You gain an anathema as part of your pact with the
fey. If you violate this anathema, you lose Fey’s Fortune until
you receive the effects of a successful atone ritual using the
Nature skill. The exact anathema is up to you and the GM, but

the most common requirement is that you must fulfill a single
request from any fey who knows your name.
Fey’s Fortune [free-action] (concentrate, fortune) Frequency once per
day; Trigger You attempt a skill check and haven’t yet rolled;
Effect Roll the skill check twice and use the better result.

## Haunted Background


## Rare

You are followed by a spirit or entity, either from childhood or
since a momentous event. You and others may have seen this
entity. You have studied esoteric subjects trying to understand
your situation, but this presence in your life remains a mystery.
Whatever this entity is or wants, it influences your life in subtle
ways, and not always for the better. Sometimes the entity helps
you, but at other times, its influence is malevolent or harmful.
The entity is most likely to surface in stressful situations.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Occultism and an additional skill in which
the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any
time you attempt a skill check for the entity’s skill, the GM can
offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the
entity were Aiding you. If you accept but fail the check, you
are frightened 2 (frightened 4 on a critical failure). The initial
frightened value can’t be reduced by effects that would reduce
or prevent the condition (such as a fighter’s bravery).

## Returned Background


## Rare

You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the
realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and
undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free attribute boost.
You gain the Diehard feat and the Additional Lore feat for
Boneyard Lore.

## Royalty Background


## Rare

You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have
eschewed the daily routines of royal life and taken up an
adventurous quest—perhaps you’re a deposed queen hoping
to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting life, or a
sovereign’s heir on a secret mission.
Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free attribute boost.
You are trained in Society. You gain the Courtly Graces skill
feat and can influence commoners in your family’s territory,
as well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the Leverage
Connections skill feat (page 232), you automatically have
common and noble connections within any community in your
royal family’s territory and have noble connections in large
communities outside your territory.

The following pages present eight new classes that enrich and expand the world of
Pathfinder. Each follows the format described on pages 91–92 of Player Core.
