Your Spellcasting Style
If you’re playing a spellcaster, it can be fun to consider
your personal spellcasting style. Casters of different
traditions usually have the biggest gulf between them
in how they cast spells, but there’s also differentiation
between—and within—classes!
Preparing your Spells
If you prepare spells, consider what it looks like as you
do so. Typically, arcane spellcasters consult their books,
self-reflect, or otherwise study; divine casters pray to fill
their heart with spells that will serve their deity; occult
casters attempt to decipher cryptic messages, often while
referencing occult texts; and primal casters might seek
natural places to contemplate their magic, such as a grove
or underground cavern.
Spontaneous spellcasters, not needing to prepare, tend
to wake up with their magical reserves restored. This
might be a refreshed or vivacious feeling, a teeming thrum
throughout the body, or a sense of impending dread or awe.
Casting your Spells
For one spellcaster, casting a spell is a stressful, painful
process. For another, it’s a moment of triumph as they
outsmart their enemy with just the right trick.
As mentioned on page 299 of Player Core, the
manifestation of your magic might produce different
sensory effects. You should also think about the nature of
the gestures and vocal incantations you use to cast that
spell. Do you chant with a different timbre than your
normal speaking voice? Does this voice resemble that of
your deity or some other supernatural being? When you
gesture, what does it look like? Are they abstract motions
that correspond to different facets of the magic? Perhaps
you always end your incantations with a firm, direct gesture,
like pointing your finger or raising a fist. The particulars of
spellcasting are abstracted, so you can customize each facet
for your character.
Refocusing
Your class briefly describes what you need to do to
Refocus, such as meditating for the monk. Start out with
some idea of what this looks like for you and refine it
during play. What you need to do to Refocus is broadly
defined to allow a variety of methods that make sense
in the story. One sorcerer might absentmindedly twirl a
shiny dragon scale—a remnant of a draconic ancestor—
in their hand with their familiar, while another might
contemplate the flow of a nearby river to remind themself
of the power of water.
Spell Lists
A superscript “H” indicates a spell has extra effects when
heightened, and an uncommon spell has a superscript

## “U.”


## Spell Traits

Several sections within the full rules for casting spells
in Player Core cover how spell traits function, including
traits like morph and subtle. Spell traits usually apply
only to spells, but the traits concentrate and manipulate
apply to other actions. All spells have the concentrate or
manipulate trait (or both). Below are some reminders on
how these traits work with spells.
Spells with the concentrate trait require you to focus
on your magic. If the spell has a casting time longer than
a few actions (such as a full minute or even 10 minutes),
you need to maintain that concentration and can’t
perform other actions. If your concentration is broken
(such as if a fight begins), your spell is disrupted.
Spells with the manipulate trait require you to
physically use a locus or make definitive gestures. If
your hands are bound, you might not be able to cast
such spells. Remember that actions with the manipulate
trait often trigger reactions, some of which have the
possibility of disrupting your spell.

## Spells


## Animal Vision Spell 3


## Concentrate Manipulate Mental

Traditions primal
Cast 1 minute
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 animal
Duration 1 hour
You tap into the target’s senses, allowing you to sense whatever
it senses for the spell’s duration. If the target wishes to prevent
you from doing so, it can attempt a Will save, negating the spell
on a success, but most animals don’t bother to do so. While
tapping into the target’s senses, you can’t use your own body’s
senses, but you can change back and forth from your body’s
senses to the target’s senses using a Sustain action.
ANIMATED ASSAULT [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You use your mind to manipulate unattended objects in the area,
temporarily animating them to attack. The objects hover in the
air, then hurl themselves at nearby creatures in a chaotic flurry of
debris. This assault deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage (basic Reflex
save) to each creature in the area. On subsequent rounds, the first
time each round you Sustain this spell, it deals 1d10 bludgeoning
damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area.
Heightened (+2) The initial damage increases by 2d10, and the
subsequent damage increases by 1d10.

## Anointed Ground Spell 3


## Concentrate Consecration Manipulate

Traditions divine
Cast 1 minute; Cost oils worth 3 gp
Area 30-foot burst centered on you
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with certain oils and warding
it against your foes. Choose aberrations, celestials, dragons,
fiends, monitors, or undead. All creatures in the area gain a +1
status bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws
against the chosen creatures.
BESTIAL CURSE [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 living humanoid
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies


## Animated Assault

You tap into the target’s inner being and curse it to become a
bestial version of itself. The effect is based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s body gains minor bestial features. Its
insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be
clumsy 1 for 1 round. When it recovers from the clumsy
condition, its features revert to normal, and the spell ends.
Failure The target transforms into a bestial form for 1 hour. The
target becomes clumsy 1 and gains weakness 1 to silver. It gains
a claw, hoof, horn, or jaws Strike (your choice) that uses the
target’s unarmed Strike statistics except that the damage type
changes to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate.
Whenever the target attempts to use any manipulate action, it
must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
BLANKET OF STARS [two-actions] SPELL 6

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions occult, primal
Defense Will; Duration 10 minutes
A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with
pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the
cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks
to Hide and Sneak. While outside under a starry night sky,
you’re also invisible as long as you remain still. When moving
under a starry night sky, you’re concealed instead.
Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature
that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this
is a mental, visual effect.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is dazzled until the end of its next turn.
Critical Failure The creature is confused and dazzled until the
end of its next turn.
BLINDING FURY [reaction] SPELL 6
### Concentrate Curse Emotion Incapacitation Mental
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Trigger A creature damages you.
Range 60 feet; Targets the triggering creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The
effect is determined by the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target can’t observe you until the end of its turn,
and if you’re currently observed by it, you become hidden to it.
Failure As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target
damages you, it can’t observe you until the end of its turn.
Critical Failure As success, and for an unlimited duration, the
first time each round the target damages a creature, it can’t
observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages
several creatures at once, the creature it can’t perceive is
chosen randomly among those creatures.
BLISTER [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You point at a target in range, and its skin grows searing blisters
filled with caustic fluid. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target grows one blister. You can spend a single
action, which has the concentrate trait, to pop a blister. The
target and each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from
the target takes 7d6 acid damage (basic Fortitude save). You
choose the direction of the cone, which can’t include the
target. When no blisters are left, the spell ends.
Failure As success, but the target grows two blisters.
Critical Failure As success, but the target grows four blisters.
Heightened (+1) The damage of a popped blister increases by 1d6.
BLISTERING INVECTIVE [two-actions] SPELL 2
### Auditory Concentrate Emotion Fear Manipulate Mental
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth—words
so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your
diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 persistent fire damage, and the
target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn’t understand
the language or you’re not speaking a language, it gains a +4
circumstance bonus to its save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half the persistent fire damage.
Failure The target becomes frightened 1 and takes the full
persistent fire damage.
Critical Failure The target becomes frightened 2 and takes
double the persistent fire damage.
Heightened (+2) You can target two additional creatures, and
the persistent damage increases by 2d6.
BULLHORN [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
### Auditory Cantrip Concentrate Illusion Manipulate
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Duration 10 minutes
You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily
at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard
loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other
ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the
volume, this doesn’t make your voice jarring or distracting. This
doesn’t increase the range or area of other auditory or linguistic
effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block
or muffle your voice as normal.
Your loud voice makes it easier to Coerce others, and the
acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1
status bonus to checks to Coerce and auditory Performance
checks to Perform at a large venue.
You can Dismiss the spell.
Heightened (5th) Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200
feet away.
Heightened (7th) Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1
mile away.

241

CARRYALL [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Force Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Duration 8 hours
A small platform of magical force materializes adjacent to you to
carry cargo. It is invisible or has a ghostly appearance, is 2 feet
in diameter, and follows 5 feet behind you, floating just above
the ground. It holds up to 5 Bulk of objects (if they can fit on
it). Any objects atop the platform fall to the ground when the
spell ends. You can Sustain the spell to move the platform up to
30 feet along the ground, to make it stay in place, or to have it
return to you and resume following you.
The spell ends if a creature tries to ride atop the platform,
if the platform is overloaded, if anyone tries to lift or force the
platform higher above the ground, or if you move more than 60
feet away from the platform.
Heightened (4th) The platform can carry 10 Bulk, creatures can
ride atop it, and it can hover in the air, not just on the ground.
CHAMELEON COAT [three-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions primal
Range 15 feet; Targets up to 8 creatures
Duration 10 minutes
You shift the colors of the targets’ outermost layer of clothing
and gear to be closer to their environment when they remain
still. Creatures affected by the spell gain a +3 status bonus to
Stealth checks to Hide. The changed color granted by the spell
always shifts to match the environment, even if there are drastic
changes. If any piece of gear or clothing affected by the spell is
removed from a creature, the spell ends for that creature.
Heightened (6th) If a creature affected by this spell rolls a
critical failure on its Stealth check to Sneak within 30 feet of
a creature that would spot it, it instead only fails its check, as
the spell mildly hypnotizes the spotter.
Heightened (8th) As 6th rank, and the status bonus is +4.
CHARITABLE URGE [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Incapacitation Manipulate Mental

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You speak on the virtue of charity, compelling the target to give
away its possessions. The target must attempt a Will save. If the
target has no items on its person, the spell fails.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is stunned 1 as it wrestles with the urge.
Failure On its next turn, before it does anything else, the
target must present the nearest creature with an item in its
possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if the
only item it has is one that it’s currently using to defend itself,
such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can choose
to be stunned for 1 round instead of giving up the item. This
might require the target to Interact to retrieve an item or
move to reach the nearest creature, and passing the item off
requires an Interact action as normal.
Critical Failure As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds, and
the target must repeat the effects of a failure on each of its
turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt
a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round,
ending the effects entirely on a critical success.
CHILLING SPRAY [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Cold Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 15-foot cone
Defense Reflex
A cone of icy shards bursts from your spread hands and coats
the targets in a layer of frost. You deal 2d4 cold damage to
creatures in the area; they must each attempt a Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and takes a –5-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 2 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and takes a
–10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 2 rounds.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d4.
CHROMA LEACH [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range touch; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Fortitude
Your hand glows with impossible colors from beyond the stars,
and your touch saps both color and vitality from the living. The
target must attempt a Fortitude save; creatures with the gnome
trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 round.
Failure The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and drained 1. The
target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For 1 round, if
the target tries to use a move action, it must succeed at a Will
save against your spell DC or the action is lost; this effect has
the mental and emotion traits.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is permanently
enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as sound
body can remove these conditions).
CLOAK OF COLORS [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate Visual

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are
dazzled while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes
a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a
melee attack must attempt a Will save. The creature is then
temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the
incapacitation trait.
Success The attacker is unaffected.
Failure The attacker is blinded for 1 round.
Critical Failure The attacker is stunned for 1 round.

COLLECTIVE TRANSPOSITION [two-actions] SPELL 6

## Concentrate Manipulate Teleportation

your line of sight. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target can teleport if it wants, but it chooses
the destination within range.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure You teleport the target and choose its destination.
Heightened (+1) The number of targets increases by 1.
CONCORDANT CHOIR [one-action] TO [three-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Sonic

Traditions divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets varies
Defense basic Fortitude
You unleash a dangerous consonance of reverberating sound,
focusing on a single target or spreading out to damage many
foes. The number of actions you spend Casting this Spell

Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A cloud of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the cloud, as are those within
20 feet of the cloud’s area. A creature must attempt a Will save
if it is inside the cloud when you cast it, enters the cloud, ends
its turn within the cloud, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the
cloud. A creature currently affected by the cloud doesn’t need
to attempt new saves.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After
the stunned condition ends, the creature is confused for the
remaining duration of the spell.
CONTAINMENT [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Force Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Reflex (see text); Duration 1 minute
You wrap a creature in an immobile force field, whether to
protect it or those around it. The field blocks attacks, effects,
and creatures that would pass through it, including the target.
The field has Hardness 10, 40 Hit Points, and immunity to
critical hits and precision damage. If the target of containment
is unwilling, the effects depend on the target’s Reflex save.
Critical Success The target escapes from the field as it’s forming,
causing it to collapse.
Success The field partially forms with 10 Hit Points instead of 40.
Failure The field has its normal effect.
Heightened (+1) The field’s Hit Points are 5 higher on a success
or 15 higher on a failure.
CORROSIVE MUCK [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Acid Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Area all squares in two 10-foot bursts
Duration 1 minute
You create two puddles of acidic slime that hinders the movement
of anyone who walks through it. The area of each pool becomes
greater difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its
turn in one of the pools or enters a pool during a move action
it’s using, it takes 8d6 acid damage with a basic Reflex save.
A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes 1d6
persistent acid damage. As normal, if a Large or larger creature
starts its turn in both pools, it takes the damage only once.
Heightened (+2) Create an additional 10-foot burst.
COUNTLESS EYES [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
Eyes form across the touched creature’s body, allowing it to
see in all directions at once. The subject can’t be flanked for the
spell’s duration. In addition, when the subject succeeds when
Seeking, it critically succeeds instead.
CRASHING WAVE [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Manipulate Water

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 30-foot cone
Defense basic Reflex
You summon a crashing wave that sweeps away from you. You
deal 6d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area. The
water also extinguishes non-magical fires in the area.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
CURSE OF LOST TIME [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Void

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 Large or smaller object, construct, or
living creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies
You curse the target with rapid aging or erosion. The effect
depends on whether the target is an object, a construct, or a

243

living creature. Artifacts, along with objects and constructs made
of precious materials (as determined by the GM), are immune.
- Object If the object is attended, its bearer can attempt
a Fortitude save. If the bearer fails or the object is
unattended, the object immediately takes 4d6 damage
(applying Hardness normally), and the item is cursed
with an unlimited duration. Until the curse ends, the item
becomes shoddy and can’t be Repaired, and the curse
attempts to counteract any spell that would restore the
object’s Hit Points. Cleanse affliction can target an item
affected by this spell.
- Construct The construct takes 4d6 damage (basic Fortitude
save). On a failure, for 1 hour, the construct is clumsy 1, is
enfeebled 1, and can’t be Repaired, and the curse attempts
to counteract any spell that would restore the construct’s
Hit Points. On a critical failure, these effects have an
unlimited duration.
- Living Creature The living creature must attempt a
Fortitude save. Ageless creatures are immune.
Critical Success The living creature is unaffected.
Success The living creature briefly ages, becoming
clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 round.
Failure As success, with a duration of 1 hour.
Critical Failure As success, with an unlimited duration.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
DÉJÀ VU [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Incapacitation Manipulate Mental

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 2 rounds
You loop a thought process in the target’s mind, forcing it to
repeat a moment’s worth of actions. The target must attempt
a Will save. If the target fails, whatever actions the target uses
on its next turn, it must repeat on its following turn. The actions
must be repeated in the same order and as close to the same
specifics as possible. For example, if the target makes an attack,
it must repeat the attack against the same creature, if possible,
and if the target moves, it must move the same distance and
direction, if possible, on its next turn.
If the target can’t repeat an action, such as Casting a Spell
that has been exhausted or needing to target a creature that
has died, it can act as it chooses for that action but becomes
stupefied 1 until the end of its turn.
DISMANTLE [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 non-magical object in your possession
of 1 Bulk or less
Duration 1 minute
You touch an object, and it immediately disassembles itself
into its component pieces. The spell fails if the target lacks
component pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of
stone), and using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap
typically triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and
the component pieces become small enough to be hidden under
normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell.
When the spell ends, the object reassembles itself into its
original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have
them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise. Once
reassembled, the object loses the broken condition, and its Hit
Points return to the value the object had when you Cast the Spell.
Heightened (4th) The spell lasts for 10 minutes.
Heightened (6th) The spell lasts until your next daily preparations.

## Dream Council Spell 8

### Concentrate Illusion Manipulate Mental Sleep
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range planetary; Targets up to 12 creatures you know by name
and have met in person
Duration 1 hour
When you Cast this Spell, any targets—including you—can choose
to immediately fall asleep. The spell ends for any creatures that
don’t choose to fall asleep. Sleepers join a shared dream, where
they can communicate with one another as though they were in
the same room. Individual targets leave this shared dream upon
awakening, and if all the targets awaken, the spell ends.
DROP DEAD [reaction] SPELL 5
### Uncommon Illusion Manipulate Subtle Visual
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Trigger A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns
invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with
a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead
body. If the target’s death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian
at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant
the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the
illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This
ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.
Heightened (7th) The spell doesn’t end if the target uses a
hostile action.
DULL AMBITION [two-actions] SPELL 4
### Concentrate Curse Manipulate Mental Misfortune
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You curse the target to fail in all avenues of its life that require
drive and ambition, as it inadvertently undermines its own goals
at every turn. The effect is based on the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success For 1 hour, the target rolls twice and uses the lower
result on initiative rolls.
Failure For 1 day, the target rolls twice and uses the lower result
on initiative rolls and any check to determine the success of
a downtime activity.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.

FAMILIAR’S FACE [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Manipulate Scrying

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 1 mile; Targets 1 willing creature that’s your animal
companion or familiar
Duration sustained
The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see
through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other
senses. If you Cast a Spell with the revelation trait that affects
your senses, such as see the unseen, while this spell is active,
you gain the benefit of the spell through the target’s senses
instead of your own. You can also speak through the target with
a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre
and character of the target’s growls or squawks. You can use
Command an Animal on the target as part of Sustaining this
spell. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect to your target
when you Cast this Spell.
FINAL SACRIFICE [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Fire Manipulate

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature with the minion trait that
you summoned or permanently control
Defense basic Reflex
You channel disruptive energies through the bond between you
and your minion, causing it to violently explode. The target is
immediately slain, and the explosion deals 6d6 fire damage to
creatures within 20 feet of it with a basic Reflex save.
If the target has the cold or water trait, the spell deals cold
damage and has the cold trait instead of the fire trait. Attempting
to cast this spell targeting a creature that you temporarily seized
control of, such as an undead commanded by bind undead,
automatically fails and breaks the controlling effect.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
FUNGAL INFESTATION [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Fungus Manipulate Poison

Traditions primal
Range touch; Area 15-foot cone
Defense Fortitude
Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to
erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal
2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must attempt
a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half the persistent poison damage.
Failure The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While
it’s taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to
fire and weakness 1 to slashing.
Critical Failure As failure, but double the persistent poison
damage. While it’s taking this persistent poison damage, it
has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

245


## Final Sacrifice

Heightened (+2) The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and
the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
GALE BLAST [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

## Air Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 5-foot emanation
Defense Fortitude
Wind flows from your outstretched hands and whirls around
you in a 5-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes 1d6
bludgeoning damage, with a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is pushed 5 feet
away from you.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is pushed
10 feet away from you.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.

## Ghostly Tragedy Spell 4


## Uncommon Concentrate Manipulate Spirit

Traditions divine, occult
Cast 1 minute
Area 60-foot emanation
Duration 10 minutes
This spell compels local spirits to reenact a violent event of
the recent past that you’re aware of and name as you Cast the
Spell. You take the role of the primary victim. The reenactment
plays out the final 9 minutes leading up to the death or injury
of the victim and the minute after. The spirits don’t change
form, so this doesn’t help determine perpetrators by their
looks. Spiritual forms of missing creatures necessary for
the event manifest as needed, and missing items appear as
shadowy outlines.
Once the scene ends, you take 2d6 void damage for each
ghostly apparition that participated in the scene (typically equal
to the number of creatures involved other than the victim). Any
creature that observed the ghostly recreation, including you,
can attempt checks to investigate the event to discover new
clues and information.
GHOULISH CRAVINGS [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Mental

Traditions divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You touch the target to afflict it with the overwhelming desire to
eat raw meat. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is sickened 1 by its unbidden hunger.
Failure The target is sickened 2 and can’t reduce this condition
below sickened 1 until it first consumes some raw meat; if the
creature doesn’t have access to raw meat, it can take a bite
out of a corpse within reach as an Interact action.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target can’t reduce the
condition below sickened 2 until it consumes raw meat.
GRAVITY WELL [two-actions] SPELL 3

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Defense Reflex
You create a sphere of altered gravity. All creatures and
unsecured objects in the area move toward the center, depending
on their Reflex saving throws. This follows the rules for forced
movement. If there’s not enough space near the center of the
sphere, creatures and objects nearer to the center move first,
and others move as far as they can without being blocked, up to
the amount set by their saving throw outcomes.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature moves 5 feet toward the center.
Failure The creature moves 15 feet toward the center.
Critical Failure The creature moves 30 feet toward the center.
GRISLY GROWTHS [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 corporeal creature
Defense basic Fortitude
This gruesome spell causes the target to grow excess limbs and
organs, whether it be fingers multiplying until hands resemble
bushes, eyes popping open in bizarre places, legs sprouting from
the side of the body, or some other result. The target takes 10d6
piercing damage (basic Fortitude save) as the new features erupt.
This spell has no effect on a target with a mutable anatomy or
no limbs, such as an ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly
and fall away after 1 round.
In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds,
creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target, must
attempt Will saves, after which they’re temporarily immune to
this secondary effect of grisly growths for 1 hour. This additional
effect is a mental and visual effect.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is sickened 1.
Critical Failure The creature is sickened 2.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
HAUNTING HYMN [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
### Auditory Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate Sonic
Traditions divine, occult
Area 15-foot cone
Defense basic Fortitude
You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear.
The hymn deals 1d8 sonic damage, with a basic Fortitude save.
If a target critically fails the save, it’s also deafened for 1 minute.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d8.
HOLY CASCADE [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Holy Manipulate Water

Traditions divine
Cost one vial of holy water (Pathfinder GM Core 268)
Range 500 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex

You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of holy water,
tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous
burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the
area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional
6d6 spirit damage to creatures with the unholy trait in the area.
Heightened (+1) The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, and
the additional spirit damage increases by 2d6.
ICE STORM [three-actions] SPELL 4

## Cold Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an
icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail
deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each
creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow
and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder
of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain. Any
creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 2 cold damage. If
you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two nonoverlapping
clouds instead of one. As normal, if a Large or larger creature is
in both clouds, it still only takes the initial damage once and the
continuing damage once per turn.
Heightened (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold
damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage creatures
take at the end of their turns increases by 1.

## Imaginary Lockbox Spell 5


## Concentrate Manipulate Mental

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range touch; Targets 1 container and its contents, totaling 10
Bulk or less
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You turn a container and its contents into an imaginary form
stored in your mind that only you can see and interact with.
The container’s physical properties—the material from which it’s
made, any locks, or other features—are irrelevant to the casting
of this spell, but the container can’t contain any creatures. The
container has no Bulk, and you can visualize everything inside it.
You can retrieve an item from the lockbox as an activity that
takes 3 actions and has the concentrate and manipulate traits.
Putting items back isn’t possible. You can Dismiss the spell.
When the spell ends, the container returns to its normal state,
either appearing in your hands if it can fit there or on the ground
adjacent to you if not.
IMPRINT MESSAGE [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object
You project psychic vibrations onto the target object,
imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your
design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who
casts object reading (page 248) on the target object, replacing
any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is
in the area of a retrocognition spell, the imprinted messages
appear as major events in the timeline, but they don’t interfere
with any other visions.
If the object is targeted with read aura of a higher spell
rank than imprint message, the caster learns that the object
has been magically modified. When you Cast this Spell, any
prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of
imprint message fade.
INVISIBLE ITEM [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object
Duration 1 hour
You make the object invisible. This makes it undetected to all
creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target,
making it hidden to them instead if they succeed. If the item is
used as part of a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile
action is completed. Making a weapon invisible typically doesn’t
give any advantage to the attack, except that an invisible thrown
weapon or piece of ammunition can be used for an attack
without necessarily giving information about the attacker’s
hiding place unless the weapon returns to the attacker.
Heightened (3rd) The duration is until the next time you make
your daily preparations.
Heightened (7th) The duration is unlimited.
LEADEN STEPS [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Metal Morph

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You partially transform a foe’s feet into unwieldy slabs of metal,
slowing their steps. The target attempts a Fortitude saving throw.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is encumbered and has weakness 2 to
electricity until the end of your next turn. The spell can’t be
sustained.
Failure The target is encumbered and has weakness 2 to
electricity.
Critical Failure The target is encumbered and has weakness 3
to electricity.
Heightened (+1) The weakness increases by 1.
LIFEWOOD CAGE [three-actions] SPELL 7

## Concentrate Manipulate Vitality Wood

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area 1 cube 20 feet on each side
Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create an immobile, invisible prison of hardened wood
suffused with vital energy from the Forge of Creation. The cage is
a 20-foot cube made of wooden branches, each a half inch thick
and a half inch apart. Each creature in the area where you create
the cage must attempt a Reflex save. If such a creature fails,
it becomes trapped inside the cage. If it succeeds, it’s pushed

247

outside the cage into a space of its choice. If a creature in the
area is too big to fit inside the prison, the spell automatically fails.
The cage has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points, and
it’s immune to critical hits and precision damage, though it
has weakness 5 to void damage. A creature capable of passing
through the space between the bars (typically a Tiny creature)
can leave; all others are confined within. The vitality energy
suffusing the wood prevents incorporeal undead creatures from
passing through the beams. Attacks with a weapon too large
to fit between the bars can’t pass through the cage, and the
bars provide standard cover even against attacks that can pass
through the gaps. Spells and most area effects (such as dragon
breath) can pass through the cage uninhibited.
LIGHTNING STORM [three-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Electricity Manipulate

Traditions primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down one
lightning bolt within the spell’s area. The bolt is a vertical line
from the top of the storm cloud to the ground below, dealing
4d12 electricity damage to creatures in the line (basic Reflex
save). On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the
spell each round, you can call another lightning bolt within
the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create two
nonoverlapping clouds instead of one, though you can still call
down only one bolt per turn.
Heightened (+2) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.
LIVE WIRE [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
### Attack Cantrip Concentrate Electricity Manipulate Metal
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense AC
You conjure up a length of sharp copper filament humming with
electrical current that strikes out at your foe. The wire deals 1d4
slashing damage and 1d4 electricity damage, depending on your
spell attack roll against the target’s AC.
Critical Success The target takes double damage and 1d4
persistent electricity damage.
Success The target takes full damage.
Failure The target takes the electricity damage, but not the
slashing damage.
Critical Failure The target is unaffected.
Heightened (+1) The slashing damage, initial electricity damage,
and persistent electricity damage on a critical hit each
increase by 1d4.
MUD PIT [three-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Earth Manipulate Water

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet; Area squares on the ground in a 15-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
Thick, clinging mud covers the ground, 1 foot deep. The mud is
difficult terrain.
NATURE’S ENMITY [two-actions] SPELL 9

## Concentrate Manipulate Plant Wood

Traditions primal
Range 120 feet; Area 500-foot burst; Targets up to 5 creatures
Duration 10 minutes
Animals, plants, and fungi in the area turn against the targets.
Each target suffers from the following effects as long as it
remains in the area.
- Vegetation springs up from every surface, giving each
target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed any
time it’s adjacent to the plants and fungi.
- Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start of its
turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it’s
attacked by creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The
target attempts a basic Reflex save and is off-guard for 1
round on any outcome other than a critical success.
- The target loses any connection to nature or natural
creatures. The target must succeed at a DC 5 flat
check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails.
Furthermore, animal, fungus, and plant creatures become
hostile to it, even one with a strong bond to the target,
such as an animal companion.
The GM might decide that you can’t subject some creatures,
such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.
NOXIOUS VAPORS [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Poison

Traditions arcane, primal
Area 10-foot emanation
Defense basic Fortitude; Duration 1 round
You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you
from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you
Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save).
A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes
sickened 1. All creatures in the area become concealed, and all
creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures
within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
OBJECT READING [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object
You place a hand on an object to learn a piece of information about
an emotional event that occurred involving the object within the
past week, determined by the GM. If you cast object reading on
the same item multiple times, you can either concentrate on a
single event to gain additional pieces of information about that
event or gain a piece of information about another emotional
event in the applicable time frame.
Heightened (2nd) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last month.
Heightened (4th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last year.
Heightened (6th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last decade.

Heightened (8th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last century.
Heightened (9th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the entirety of the object’s history.
PHANTASMAL TREASURE [two-actions] SPELL 2
### Concentrate Emotion Illusion Manipulate Mental
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
A phantasmal image of the most precious thing imaginable to
the target appears in a location of your choice within the spell’s
range. Only the spell’s target can see the treasure, though you can
see the vague shape of the treasure—be it a pile of items, a deific
avatar, or a cherished loved one or hero. The target’s response to
the treasure is based on the outcome of the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target becomes fascinated with the treasure, and
the duration is until the end of its turn. The target can also try
to disbelieve the illusion if it touches the treasure, Seeks to
examine it, or speaks to it if the illusion appears to be a person
or the like. If the target disbelieves the illusion, the spell ends.
Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
Critical Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The
target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell
ends, it must spend each action focused on it. This can include
moving toward the treasure if the target isn’t next to it and
Interacting with the treasure if the target is next to it. (If the
illusion appears to be a person or the like, the target can also
Interact to converse with it.)
PRIMAL HERD [two-actions] SPELL 10

## Concentrate Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions primal
Range 30 feet; Targets you and up to 5 willing targets
Duration 1 minute
Summoning the power of the natural world, you transform the
targets into a herd of mammoths, and they each assume a Huge
battle form. Each target must have enough space to expand into
or the spell fails for that target. Each target gains the animal
trait. Each target can Dismiss the spell’s effects on itself. Each
target gains the following while transformed.
- AC = 22 + the target’s level. Ignore any armor check penalty
and Speed reduction.
- 20 temporary Hit Points.
- Speed 40 feet.
- Low-light vision.
- The following unarmed melee attacks, which are the only
attacks the target can use to Strike. When Striking with
these attacks, the target uses their attack modifier with
the proficiency and item bonuses of their most favorable
weapon or unarmed Strike, and the damage is listed
for each attack. These attacks are Strength based (for
the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example).
Melee [one-action] tusk (reach 15 feet), Damage 4d8+19 piercing;
Melee [one-action] trunk (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 4d6+16
bludgeoning; Melee [one-action] foot (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage
4d6+13 bludgeoning.
- Athletics modifier of +30, unless the target’s own modifier
is higher.
- Each target can use the Trample action.
Trample [three-actions] You move up to twice your Speed and move
through the space of Large or smaller creatures, trampling
each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature
takes damage from your foot Strike based on a basic Reflex
save (DC = 19 + your level).
PROTECTOR TREE [two-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Plant Wood

Traditions primal
Range 30 feet
Duration 1 minute
A Medium tree suddenly grows in an unoccupied square within
range. The tree has AC 10 and 10 Hit Points. Whenever an ally
adjacent to the tree is hit by a Strike, the tree interposes its
branches and takes the damage first. Any additional damage
beyond what it takes to reduce the tree to 0 Hit Points is dealt
to the original target. The tree isn’t large enough to impede
movement through its square.
If the tree is in soil and survives to the end of the spell’s
duration, it remains as an ordinary, non-magical tree and
continues to grow and thrive. The GM might determine that the
tree disappears immediately in certain inhospitable situations.
Heightened (+1) The tree has an additional 10 Hit Points.
PUFF OF POISON [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

## Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate Poison

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude
You exhale a shimmering cloud of toxic breath at an enemy’s
face. The target takes 1d4 poison damage and 1d4 persistent
poison damage, depending on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half initial damage and no persistent
damage.
Failure The target takes full initial and persistent damage.
Critical Failure The target takes double initial and persistent
damage.
Heightened (+2) The initial poison damage increases by 1d4, and
the persistent poison damage increases by 1d4.
REAPER’S LANTERN [two-actions] SPELL 2
### Aura Concentrate Death Light Manipulate
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Area 5-foot emanation
Defense Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You call forth a ghostly lantern that guides the living toward
death and the undead toward true death. It sheds bright
light in the spell’s area and dim light to twice that area. The
lantern is insubstantial and floats near you, suspended from
an ephemeral, skeletal hand. Living creatures and undead in

249

the area when you Cast the Spell, or that enter the area later,
must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their
Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing
effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their
Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area. Once
a creature attempts a save against reaper’s lantern, it uses the
same outcome if it leaves the area and enters it again.
Once per turn, starting on the round after you cast reaper’s
lantern, you can Sustain the spell to increase the emanation’s
radius by 5 feet. When you do so, you force creatures in the
area that haven’t yet attempted a save against reaper’s lantern
to attempt one.

## Resplendent Mansion Spell 9


## Concentrate Manipulate Structure

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range 500 feet
Duration until your next daily preparations
You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and up to
300 feet on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold an image
of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The
mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire,
and it’s decorated as you imagine it. You can imagine a purpose
for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments
appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function
normally for anyone inside the mansion, but they cease to exist
if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can
create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the
mansion function normally.
Your mansion contains the same types and quantities of
foodstuffs and servants as created by the planar palace spell.
Each of the mansion’s exterior doorways and windows are
protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is
audible or mental as you Cast the Spell, and each has a different
sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one),
allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 60 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Misshapen skeletal forms erupt from a solid surface, such as a
stone floor, and fill the burst. The area they fill is difficult terrain.
Their grasping claws deal 2d6 slashing damage to creatures on
the ground in the area when the skeletons first appear with a
basic Reflex save.
On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the Spell
each round, you can move the area of skeletons up to 20 feet
within the range of the spell and deal 2d6 slashing damage with
a basic Reflex save to each creature in the new area.
Damaging or destroying the skeletons is irrelevant, as new
bones pull forth from the ground to repair and replace any that
are obliterated.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
SACRED FORM [two-actions] SPELL 6

## Concentrate Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions divine
Duration 1 minute
You focus all your divine energy and transform yourself into a
battle form, similar to your normal form and of the same size

form, you gain the statistics and abilities listed below. You have
hands in this battle form and can use manipulate actions. You

and Speed reduction.

ranged attack). The damage dice for Strikes with the weapon
are 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 spirit damage. If you
have a deity, you can have the weapon take the form of your
deity’s favored weapon and use its damage die size, damage
type, and traits. If the favored weapon is a simple weapon
with 1d4 or 1d6 damage die, the weapon damage dice are
one size larger than normal, though the spirit damage is
unchanged. You can also use your attack modifier with this
favored weapon if it’s higher than that given by the spell.
- Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own is higher.
Heightened (8th) You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15
temporary Hit Points, resistance 4 against physical damage,
attack modifier +28, damage bonus +15 (+12 for a ranged

electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, sonic, or void. The effect is
based on the target’s Fortitude save.

Duration 10 minutes

251


## Resplendent Mansion

You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long
as the targets remain within the emanation. If a creature made

the spell ends, the spell’s duration continues until the object is in
a location large enough to accommodate its normal size.
SPELL RIPOSTE [reaction] SPELL 7

## Uncommon Manipulate

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Trigger You’re the target of a spell you’re aware of.

SPIRIT SONG [two-actions] SPELL 8

## Concentrate Manipulate Spirit

Traditions divine, occult
Area 60-foot cone
Defense Fortitude
Your eldritch song sends pulsing waves of ethereal energy to
attack creatures’ spirits in the area, dealing 14d6 spirit damage
that causes their bodies to momentarily freeze up from the
hypnotic nature of the tune, depending on the result of their
Fortitude save. The vibrating waves of spirit song penetrate into,
but not through, solid barriers, damaging incorporeal creatures
hiding in solid objects in the area but not passing onward to
damage creatures in other rooms.

until the beginning of its turn.
Failure The creature takes full damage, can’t use reactions until

## Concentrate Curse Manipulate Spirit

Traditions divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You curse the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious

creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it’s
affected is targeted by spiritual epidemic and must also attempt
a Will save. The curse continues to spread in this way.

SPOUT [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

## Cantrip Concentrate Manipulate Water

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area a 5-foot cube
Defense basic Reflex
Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a
pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the
area take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving
throw. A creature that critically fails its save is disoriented by
the explosion of water, becoming off-guard until the end of your
next turn.
You can change this spell’s area to a 5-foot burst, provided
you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can
be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle
or bathtub.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
STRANGE GEOMETRY [three-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Illusion Manipulate

Traditions occult
Range 60 feet; Area 4 cubes, each 10 feet on a side
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
You cause the areas to appear to swell, bend, and break, twisting
together in a bizarre spatial geometry. The cubes of the spell’s

area can’t be adjacent to one another. A creature must attempt
a Will save if it’s in one of the cubes when you Cast the Spell,
or if it later enters one of the areas, with the following effects.
A creature interacting with the illusion can also attempt a Will
save to disbelieve the illusion, as normal.
Success The creature disbelieves the illusion.
Failure All terrain in the cubes is difficult terrain for the creature,
including the air if the creature is flying, walls if it’s climbing,
and so on. When the creature would exit one of the cubes,
it exits from one randomly determined by the GM. This is a
teleportation effect. It can exit from any edge of that cube
it chooses. When selecting a random cube, the GM excludes
any that don’t match the creature’s terrain; for instance, if
the creature were exiting along the ground, the GM would
exclude any cube that didn’t have an exit on the ground.
SUDDEN BLIGHT [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate Void

Traditions divine, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense basic Fortitude
You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living
creature in the area takes 2d10 void damage with a basic
Fortitude save. A creature afflicted by a disease takes a –2
circumstance penalty to this save.
You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny
non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical
undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and
concealment. Sudden blight attempts to counteract any magical
effect on the plants before withering them.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10.
SUMMON LESSER SERVITOR [three-actions] SPELL 1

## Concentrate Manipulate Summon

Traditions divine
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
While deities jealously guard their most powerful servants
from the summoning spells of those who aren’t steeped in the
faith, this spell allows you to conjure an inhabitant of the Outer
Sphere with or without the deity’s permission. You summon
a celestial, fiend, or monitor of level –1. You can choose to
instead summon an animal of level –1 that hails from the Outer
Sphere; you can choose for this animal to gain the celestial and
holy traits, the fiend and unholy traits, or the monitor trait.
It’s anathema to summon a servitor if it has a holy or
unholy trait that isn’t allowed for your deity’s sanctification.
For example, Sarenrae’s sanctification is “can choose holy,” so
you couldn’t summon an unholy creature, and Pharasma’s is
“none,” so you couldn’t summon a holy or unholy creature.
The GM might determine that your deity restricts specific
types of creatures further, making it anathema to summon
them as well.
Heightened (2nd) The creature can be level 1 or lower.
Heightened (3rd) The creature can be level 2 or lower.
Heightened (4th) The creature can be level 3 or lower.
SYNESTHESIA [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate Mental

Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
The target’s senses are suddenly rewired in unexpected ways,
causing them to process noises as bursts of color, smells as
sounds, and so on. This has three effects, and the target must
attempt a Will save.
- Due to the distraction, the target must succeed at a DC 5
flat check each time it uses a concentrate action, or the
action fails and is wasted.
- The target’s difficulty processing visual input makes all
creatures and objects concealed from it.
- The creature has trouble moving, making it clumsy 3 and
giving it a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is affected for 1 round.
Failure The target is affected for 1 minute.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target is stunned 2 as it
attempts to process the sensory shifts.
Heightened (9th) You can target up to five creatures.
TELEPATHIC DEMAND [three-actions] SPELL 9
### Concentrate Incapacitation Linguistic Manipulate Mental
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature you’ve telepathically
contacted before
Defense Will; Duration varies
You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it
can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words
or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of a
suggestion spell, with the message substituting for the spoken
suggestion. On a successful save, the target is temporarily
immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the target is
temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a creature only
if you’ve previously been in telepathic contact with it before,
such as via the telepathy spell.
THOUGHTFUL GIFT [one-action] SPELL 1

## Manipulate Teleportation

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your
hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target’s
hand if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don’t. The
target knows what object you’re attempting to send them. If
the target is unconscious or refuses to accept your gift, or if the
spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an
extradimensional container), the spell fails.
Heightened (3rd) The spell’s range increases to 500 feet.
Heightened (5th) As 3rd level, and the object’s maximum Bulk
increases to 1. You can Cast the Spell with 3 actions instead of
1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile, and you don’t need
line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar
with the target.

253


## Threefold Aspect Spell 3


## Concentrate Manipulate Polymorph

Traditions occult, primal
Cast 1 minute
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
This spell allows you to change between three versions of
yourself of different ages: a maiden (young adult), a mother
(adult), or a matriarch (elderly). Choose one when you Cast the
Spell. While the spell lasts, you can change the age to any
of the three or to your natural age by Sustaining the spell.
Your form always looks like you regardless of the age, and
creatures who know you still recognize you and can tell your
age is different.
Threefold aspect alters your physical appearance and
personality to present an authentic version of yourself at
various ages. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception
checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your
level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you’re
untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses
a Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn’t
get a chance to notice that you aren’t at your true age. You
can Dismiss this spell.
VAMPIRIC MAIDEN [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Concentrate Manipulate Void

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude
A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its
vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4
void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save.
You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the void damage the
target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and
the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after
1 minute.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden.
The target takes full damage and is immobilized by the iron
maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action to
extricate itself, whichever comes first.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is
immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it
Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.
Heightened (+1) The piercing and void damage increase by
1d4 each.
VISIONS OF DANGER [three-actions] SPELL 7
### Auditory Concentrate Illusion Manipulate Visual
Traditions occult
Range 500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Defense basic Will; Duration 1 minute
An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell’s area. The creatures
look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific appearance of
your choice, such as fiendish flies or animated saw blades. The
burst deals 8d8 mental damage with a basic Will save to each
creature that’s inside the burst when it’s created, enters the
burst, or starts its turn inside the burst. A creature that critically
succeeds at its Will save can immediately attempt to disbelieve
the illusion. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters
or observes one with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the
illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion take no damage
from the illusion thereafter.
Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by 1d8.
VOMIT SWARM [two-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Area 30-foot cone
Defense basic Reflex
You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and
shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you
to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix of
centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn’t change
the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone in the
area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage (basic
Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also becomes
sickened 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.
WALL OF FLESH [two-actions] SPELL 5

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions divine, occult, primal
Range 60 feet
Duration 1 minute
You craft a 20-foot-tall wall of living flesh in a straight line up to
30 feet long. The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section
has AC 10 and 75 Hit Points. If you wish, the wall can be of a
smaller length or height. You must create the wall in an unbroken
open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or
objects, or the spell is lost. The wall can’t be Repaired but can be
healed by vitality, and healing spells and abilities.
When you Cast the Spell, choose one of the following features
for your wall.
- Mouths The wall has countless toothy mouths along its
surface. The mouths Strike any creature that ends its turn
within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack modifier
for these Strikes and dealing 2d6 piercing damage. The
mouths are capable of consuming potions; since the wall is
alive, it can recover Hit Points from a healing potion, but it
can’t benefit from any effect that would give it the ability
to move. Otherwise, the GM determines which potions can
affect the wall.
- Eyes The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You
can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance
bonus to visual Perception checks within the wall’s line
of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line of
sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don’t have line
of effect through the wall.
- Arms The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature
that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt a
Reflex save.

Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is grabbed by the wall for 1 round
or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever
comes first.
Critical Failure The creature is restrained by the wall
for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC,
whichever comes first.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 10, and the piercing damage dealt by the wall’s
mouths increases by 1d6.

## Wanderer’S Guide Spell 3


## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions divine, occult
Cast 1 minute
Duration until your next daily preparations
You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you Cast
this Spell, choose a destination; you receive an inspired route
to that destination, allowing you and allies who travel overland
with you to reduce the movement penalty from difficult terrain
by half for the duration, as long as you don’t deviate from the
inspired route. This doesn’t have any effect on movement during
encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is
over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.
WEAPON OF JUDGMENT [two-actions] SPELL 9

## Concentrate Manipulate Sanctified Spirit

Traditions divine
Requirements You have a deity.
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
An immense weapon of spiritual energy appears, hovering in
the air above the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual
appearance of your deity’s favored weapon. Name war or
peace when you cast this spell.
If you name “war,” mentally choose one creature. This must be a
creature both you and the target can see. The target instinctively
knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target’s
turns, if the target didn’t use a hostile action against the creature
you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target.
If you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The
target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon
Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action
against you or one of the chosen allies. The weapon Strikes
only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies
(such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike).
Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they
use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the
weapon deals 4d10 damage. The damage type is the same as
the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon).
The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more
detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). No
other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a
ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. The weapon
takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout
the target’s turn, but its penalty is separate from yours.
A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers,
resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn’t take up space,
grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would.
The weapon can’t make any attack other than its Strike, and
feats or spells that affect weapons don’t apply to this weapon.
Heightened (10th) The damage increases by 1d10.
WEB [three-actions] SPELL 2

## Concentrate Manipulate

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures’
movement. Squares filled with the web are difficult terrain.
Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action or
enters the web during a move action it’s using, it must attempt
an Athletics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to
avoid taking a circumstance penalty to its Speeds or becoming
immobilized. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to take
a circumstance penalty to its Speed from the web.
Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or
effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A
square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and it doesn’t need
to attempt further Athletics checks or saving throws against
the web this turn. If it used an Athletics check, it clears the
web from every square it leaves during its movement.
Success The creature is unaffected during its action. If it used an
Athletics check, it clears the web from every square it leaves
during its movement.
Failure The creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its
Speeds until the start of its next turn.
Critical Failure The creature is immobilized until the start of
its next turn, after which it takes a –10-foot circumstance
penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. It can attempt to Escape to
remove its immobilized condition.
Heightened (4th) The spell’s area increases to a 20-foot burst,
and its range increases to 60 feet.
WHISPERS OF THE VOID [two-actions] SPELL 4

## Auditory Concentrate Manipulate Void

Traditions divine, occult
Range 60 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Fortitude
You whisper baleful secrets that transcend language and carry
magically to the ears of your foes. The words take physical form,
weakening the life force of the targets, each of which must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes 2d8 persistent void damage.
Failure The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage and
becomes drained 1.
Critical Failure The creature takes 4d8 persistent void damage
and becomes drained 2 and doomed 1.
Heightened (+2) The persistent void damage increases by 1d8
on a success, or by 2d8 on a failure or critical failure.

## Lay On Hands

an enemy makes an attack against the ally, the enemy takes 1d4
spirit damage (even if it misses).
The benefit applies only while an ally is in your aura, ending

CHAMPION’S SACRIFICE [reaction] FOCUS 6

## Uncommon Champion Focus Manipulate

Trigger An ally is hit by a Strike or fails a saving throw against an
effect that doesn’t affect you.
Range 30 feet; Targets the triggering ally
You form a link with an ally, allowing you to take harm in their
stead. All the effects of the hit or failed save are applied to you
instead of the target. For example, if the target critically fails a
saving throw against a fireball, you would take double damage.
These effects ignore any resistances, immunities, or other abilities
you have that might mitigate them in any way, although those of
the target apply before you take the effect.
HERO’S DEFIANCE [free-action] FOCUS 10
### Uncommon Champion Concentrate Focus Healing Vitality
Trigger An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.
You shout in defiance and are filled with a burst of healing. Just
before applying the attack’s damage, you recover 6d8+20 Hit
Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you
to 0 Hit Points, you don’t become unconscious or dying. Either
way, cheating death is difficult, and you can’t use hero’s defiance
again until you Refocus or make your daily preparations. Hero’s
defiance can’t be used against effects with the death trait or that
would leave no remains, such as disintegrate.
SPECTRAL ADVANCE [one-action] OR [two-actions] FOCUS 5
### Uncommon Champion Concentrate Focus Polymorph Spirit

you’re mounted, you can have your mount move instead of you.
Movement from spectral advance doesn’t trigger reactions and
ignores difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain. During the
movement, you (or your mount) have resistance equal to your
level to all damage.

or void damage. All your Strikes deal 1d6 additional damage
of the chosen type. Your entire body is also surrounded by
a glowing corona of the same color as your inner qi; this is
a light effect. Your corona is an aura in a 5-foot emanation
that deals 2d6 damage of the chosen type to creatures
who start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation
overlaps with a darkness effect, the corona’s glow attempts

emanation or return the corona to a 5-foot emanation.

greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse

ARCANE COUNTERMEASURE [reaction] FOCUS 5

## Uncommon Focus Manipulate Sorcerer

Trigger A creature within range that you can see Casts a Spell.
Range 120 feet; Targets the spell cast by the triggering creature
You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend
against. You reduce the spell’s rank by 1, and targets of the spell
gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC,
or DC against it.
You can’t reduce the spell’s rank below its minimum. For
example, a 5th-rank howling blizzard would remain 5th-rank,
but a 5th-rank fireball would become 4th-rank. Targets still gain
all the other benefits, even if you don’t reduce the spell’s rank.
Undead

## Astral Projection Ritual 5


## Uncommon

Cast 1 hour; Cost one gem worth a total value of the target’s
level (minimum 1) × 5 gp, for each target; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary Checks
Arcana or Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the primary
check), Survival
Range touch; Targets yourself and up to 5 willing creatures
Duration see text
You project the targets’ spiritual essences into the Astral Plane,
leaving their inanimate physical forms behind. These astral
forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while
the targets’ bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where
the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can’t
be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact
with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and
all targets must be selected from these casters.
A target’s astral form is a duplicate of the target and
everything they’re carrying; anything that happens to a
duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if
you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item’s duplicate,
the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration
of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to
Dismiss their astral form and immediately return to their
physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your
astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets’ astral
forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their
physical forms simultaneously. While in the Astral Plane, the
other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they
become separated from you, they must wait for your return
or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the
targets’ astral forms vanish.
A target’s astral form and corresponding physical form are
linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the
Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as conduit and
safety line; if severed, the target’s astral and physical forms are
both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external
force, such as dispel magic being cast on a target’s physical or
astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned
to their physical body. If a target’s astral form is slain, the silver
cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain
requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as
the ritual’s primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a
success, it becomes clumsy 2, drained 2, doomed 2, and enfeebled
2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by
any means until the week has passed. A target’s physical body
remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but
if it’s destroyed, the creature dies and its astral form also vanishes.
This ritual only projects a portion of the targets’ consciousnesses
onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically to the Astral Plane
(to reach the Outer Planes, for example) requires spells such as
interplanar teleport.
Critical Success All targets are able to navigate independently
in the Astral Plane. Each target’s silver cord is stronger than
usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to its Fortitude
save to avoid dying if its astral form dies.
Success You successfully project the targets.
Failure You fail to project the targets.
Critical Failure The process of separating the targets’ spirits
from their bodies is complicated, and something goes
catastrophically wrong. All casters become doomed 1, are
immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and begin dying.

## Clone Ritual 9


## Rare

Cast 7 days; Cost rare laboratory supplies and reagents worth the
target’s level (minimum 1) × 100 gp; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Crafting (legendary); Secondary Checks Arcana,
Medicine, Occultism
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature up to 20th level
You collect hair, nail clippings, and samples of skin and blood
from the target, who must be present throughout the ritual and
can be one of the casters. You then use those samples to grow a
duplicate of the target’s physical form that will house the target’s
soul upon death. This duplicate is physically identical to the
original creature.
In order to perform the ritual, you need an expanded
alchemist’s lab (Player Core 287) or a superior set of equipment.
Once the ritual is successfully completed, the duplicate grows
within the laboratory equipment for 2d4 months. Though direct
involvement isn’t required during this period of growth, you must
prevent any interference or interruption, or the ritual fails. When
the duplicate is complete, the original creature’s soul enters it as
soon as their original body dies, or immediately if the creature

## Rituals


died during the intervening months, as long as the soul is free
and willing. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has
come or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, the
duplicate remains empty until the impediment is removed. While
unoccupied, the inert duplicate must be preserved in suitable
alchemical equipment to prevent it from rotting.
Critical Success The cloning process is successful. When the
soul occupies the completed clone, it is clumsy 1, drained 1,
doomed 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be
removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.
Success As critical success, but each condition value is 2.
Failure You fail to form the clone.
Critical Failure The clone appears to be successful, but something
went horribly wrong. Once it grows to its full size, it can’t hold
the target’s soul and instead houses a malevolent intelligence
or an invasive creature (such as a powerful demon).

## Fantastic Facade Ritual 9


## Rare Illusion

Cast 1 week; Cost mystical paint, elaborate veils, and powdered
minerals worth 20,000 gp total; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (legendary); Secondary
Checks Deception; Society or Survival; Stealth
Area up to 1 mile radius circle centered on you; Targets 1
settlement and its residents
Duration unlimited
You draw a permanent series of complex illusions over the target
settlement, choosing the look, sound, feel, and smell of the
structures, terrain, and creatures within at the time the ritual
is cast. You can alter the appearance of existing structures and
creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures. For
example, you could cause everything and everyone in the target
area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a thick canopy
that obscures the settlement from outside view, or make empty
ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you create the facade,
you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to
basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and
which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the
town square, complete with marching band). You’re unable to
alter the programs after you create the facade.
You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects
as a 3rd-rank illusory disguise. If a creature affected by the facade
leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You
decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised
by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or
after a set period, up to 1 week.
A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way
that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade,
such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or
climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the
illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an
illusory river of lava wouldn’t cause damage, nor could thorns on
an illusory rose bush prick someone.
Critical Success You create the facade as described, and you can
alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day to
reprogram them.
Success You create the facade as described.
Failure Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Your ritual produces unexpected and uncontrolled
illusions different from what you had planned, such as
unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the buildings,
unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as skeletons.
These effects fade after 1 month.
Heightened (10th) The cost increases to 100,000 gp and the
radius can be up to 5 miles.

## Fortifying Brew Ritual 5


## Uncommon

Cast 4 hours; Cost high-quality ingredients and brewing
equipment worth 25 gp; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Crafting, Nature, or Society (expert); Secondary
Checks Alcohol Lore (or related lore), Crafting, Society
Range 20 feet
You craft a large quantity of restorative drink, such as an
invigorating tea, a refreshing ale, or a stimulative alchemical
tonic. The ritual speeds along any natural processes to make the
brew, such as fermenting fruit to make a wine. At the conclusion
of the first 3 hours of the ritual, you produce enough brew for
up to 10 people to drink, any of whom can be the secondary
caster of the ritual. The brew must then be consumed over the
next hour. There is no danger of the drinkers becoming drunk if
the brew is alcoholic. Once that hour is completed, you and the
secondary caster attempt your checks as normal.
Critical Success The brew is delicious and revitalizing. It casts a
4th-rank cleanse affliction, a 4th-rank clear mind, and a 4thrank
sound body on each drinker for each relevant affliction
or condition, using your modifier for the primary skill check
as the counteract modifier. Each drinker also gains 20
temporary Hit Points that last 12 hours and a +2 status bonus
to saves against diseases and poisons for the next 12 hours.
Success As critical success, except drinkers gain only 10
temporary Hit Points, and don’t gain the status bonus to saves.
Failure You and the other drinkers are left with a sour taste—
something went wrong with the brewing process.
Critical Failure Your attempt to craft the drink resulted in
something more akin to a poison. You and the other drinkers
become sickened 4 and can’t reduce the condition for 12 hours.
Heightened (+1) The temporary Hit Points increases by 2 (or 4
on a critical success).

## Gathering Call Ritual 7


## Rare Teleportation

Cast 7 days; Cost rare oils and powdered minerals worth 5,000 gp;
Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (expert, the check has
the secret trait); Secondary Checks Arcana or Occultism
(whichever isn’t used for the primary check), Society
Range 20 feet; Targets up to seven willing creatures of 14th
level or lower
Duration 1 year
You bind yourself and your allies to the specific safe location,
referred to as a sanctuary, where you perform the ritual. This

267

allows the participants to return later by simply speaking a word.
Success You form the connection with the sanctuary. Any
participant in the ritual can Dismiss the ritual. When they do,
all the participants can immediately return to the sanctuary
from any distance, as long as they are on the same plane
as the sanctuary. Each participant arrives in the position in
which they were standing during the casting of the ritual.
When the word is spoken, all other participants know it, and
each can choose whether or not to return to the sanctuary at
that time. The ritual then immediately ends.
Failure You fail to form the connection between the participants
and the sanctuary and are aware that the ritual has failed.
Critical Failure The ritual inadvertently forms a connection
with a location on another plane. The casters are unaware
of this misalignment. When the word is invoked, all ritual
participants are shifted to this extraplanar location.
Heightened (+1) The cost increases by 5,000 gp, the ritual can
target one more creature, and the maximum level of creature
it can target increases by 2.

## Heartbond Ritual 2


## Uncommon

Cast 1 hour; Cost sacramental beverages and a set of matching
rings or other tokens worth 20 gp per secondary caster;
Secondary Casters 2 or more
Primary Check Nature or Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Diplomacy, Society
Range 20 feet
You officiate the creation of a magical bond between two or
more willing creatures, who are secondary casters of the ritual
and must share genuine affection for one another. As part of
the ritual, all members of the bond receive a ring, amulet, or
similar token to symbolize their shared connection. They lose
the effects of the ritual when not wearing the token, and the
bond is broken if either token is destroyed.
Creatures benefiting from a successful heartbond ritual can
later participate in a heightened version of the ritual without
requiring new checks by spending the required time and paying
the difference of the two costs. A creature can be under the
effects of multiple heartbond rituals at once.
Critical Success Once per day, each bonded creature can use a
2-action activity, which has the concentrate trait, to learn the
present state of one other bonded creature. The creature knows
the other creature’s direction and distance and any conditions
affecting them. Each participant can cast message as a divine
innate spell at will, but can target only another participant.
Success As a critical success, except the bonded creatures can’t
cast message as a divine innate spell.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Magical backlash creates discordant energy
among the participants. For 1 week, each secondary caster is
clumsy 2 and stupefied 2 whenever they are within 30 feet
of another secondary caster.
Heightened (6th) The cost increases to 300 gp per secondary
caster. On a success, secondary casters permanently gain the
effects of a 6th-rank telepathy spell, but only with each other.

## Inveigle Ritual 2


## Uncommon Mental

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils worth a total value of 10 gp × the
target’s level
Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or Religion
(expert)
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 creature of a level no greater than
double the inveigle ritual’s rank
Duration 1 year or until dismissed
You win over the target’s mind, causing it to see you as a close
and trusted friend and look upon your every suggestion as
reasonable. The target is helpful toward you, so it will go out of
its way to help you. As with any other helpful creature, there are
limits to what you can ask of it. If you ever ask the target to do
something completely against its nature or needlessly harmful to
the target or its interests, not only does it refuse, but it also can
attempt a Will save to end the effect early. Because of the casting
time and range, it’s generally difficult to cast this ritual unless
the target is willing (perhaps convinced the ritual will have some
other effect) or restrained. If the creature is unwilling to accept
the ritual, it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect.
Critical Success The ritual succeeds and the target takes a –4
status penalty to Will saves to end the effect.
Success The ritual succeeds.
Failure The ritual fails.
Critical Failure The ritual fails and the target instead hates you,
becoming hostile to you for the duration.
Heightened (6th) You can use inveigle on a creature up to 1 mile
away throughout the casting, as long as you have a piece of
the creature’s body, which you mix into the oils used in the
cost. The base cost is 100 gp. The duration is shorter, and
based on how large a piece of the creature’s body you use:
1 week for blood, hair, scales, and the like, or 1 month for a
hand or similarly substantial body part.

## Phantasmal Custodians Ritual 3


## Uncommon

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils, salts, and herbs worth a total value of
15 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (expert); Secondary Checks
Arcana or Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the primary
check), Diplomacy
Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 20 feet high
Duration 1 year
You create a long-lasting adaptation of the phantasmal minion
spell, forming entities to carry out basic tasks at a fixed location.
Critical Success The ritual creates six phantasmal minions (Player
Core 349). You don’t need to concentrate on them, and they
aren’t summoned minions. You can spend an action, which has
the concentrate trait, to command one to perform a basic task;
it continues to perform the task until commanded again.
Success As critical success, but the ritual creates three minions.
Failure The ritual fails to create any phantasmal minions.
Critical Failure The ritual creates six phantasmal minions, but
these creatures are hostile and capable of making fist Strikes
with an attack bonus equal to your skill modifier for the

primary skill check, dealing 1d6 force damage. They attack
you and your allies and attempt to break objects belonging to
you and your allies within the area.
Heightened (6th) If destroyed, the phantasmal minions reform
the next morning. The cost increases to 30 gp.

## Reincarnate Ritual 3


## Uncommon

Cast 4 hours; Cost rare herbs worth a total value of the target’s
level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Nature (expert); Secondary Checks Occultism,
Religion
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 8th level
You call forth the target’s soul and attempt to incarnate it into a
brand-new body. As the soul won’t be returning to the original
body, only a small portion of the creature’s remains are required.
These remains must have been part of the original body at the
time of death, and the target must have died within the past
week. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has come
or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, this ritual
automatically fails, but you discover this after you succeed at the
Religion check and can end the ritual without paying the cost.
If the ritual is successful, the target’s new body has a random
ancestry. Roll 1d20. On a result of 1 through 14, the new body
is one of a common ancestry, while on a 15 through 20 they
become a member of an uncommon or rare ancestry. The GM
chooses possible ancestries based on those found in the region
and randomly determines the ancestry. For instance, the GM
could roll 1d8 to choose a common ancestry from Player Core. The
target replaces their ancestry Hit Points, size, Speeds, attribute
boosts and flaws, traits, and special abilities with those of their
new ancestry. The target loses their heritage and ancestry feats,
selecting replacements from their new ancestry. The target’s
background, class features, and languages remain unaltered.
Critical Success You reincarnate the target into a new adult
body. This new body has full HP and has the same spells
prepared as the original did when it died.
Success As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and
no spells prepared. The soul takes some time to adjust to their
new body, leaving them clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2
for 1 week; these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by
any means until the week has passed.
Failure You fail to reincarnate the target.
Critical Failure The target’s soul becomes trapped in an
unintelligent animal creature of the GM’s choosing, with a
level no greater than half the target’s level. While trapped,
the target has an Intelligence score of 1 (–5 modifier) and can’t
use any of their own abilities.
Heightened (4th) The maximum level of the target increases to
10. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 40 gp.
Heightened (5th) The maximum level of the target increases to
12. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 75 gp.

## Heartbond

Heightened (6th) The maximum level of the target increases to
14. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 125 gp. The
target must have died within the past month.
Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases to
16. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 200 gp. The
target must have died within the past month.
Heightened (8th) The maximum level of the target increases to
18. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 300 gp. The
target must have died within the past year.
Heightened (9th) The maximum level of the target increases to
20. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 600 gp. The
target must have died within the past decade.

## Rest Eternal Ritual 4


## Uncommon Spirit

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils to anoint the body worth a total value
of the target’s level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Religion (expert); Secondary Checks Occultism,
Religion
Range 20 feet; Targets 1 dead creature
You call upon gods, spirits, and stranger beings to bar a
creature’s spirit from ever returning. A spirit that doesn’t wish to
be so constrained can attempt a Will save to resist this ritual; on
a critical success, it fools you into believing the ritual succeeded.
This ritual has no effect on a target who is undead or whose soul
is otherwise not in the afterlife.
Critical Success You sequester the subject’s spirit to the
afterlife. Attempts to communicate with the dead creature,
return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb
its afterlife fail unless the effect’s counteract rank is at least 2
higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact
or a deity. Successfully returning the creature to life ends the
restrictions placed by rest eternal.
Success As critical success, but effects to interact with the spirit
fail unless the effect’s counteract rank is higher than that of
rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The ritual fails, and the spirits you appealed to
are angered. All casters become doomed 1 for 1 week.

## Shadow Double Ritual 4


## Rare Illusion

Cast 1 day; Cost a small item of personal significance to the
creature to be duplicated (such as an item of clothing they
wear everyday or a memento of a romantic tryst), plus rare
oils, minerals, and pigments with a total value of 300 gp;
Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master, the check has the
secret trait); Secondary Checks Arcana, Nature, Occultism,
Religion, or Society (whichever is required to Recall Knowledge
about the creature being duplicated); Crafting; Deception
Targets 1 living creature
You create an illusory duplicate of the target creature by drawing
shadowy material from the Netherworld and sculpting it into a
semi-solid form. The shadow double is a 4th-level creature with
no special abilities. If it needs to attempt a roll or use a DC, use
the moderate number for a monster (GM Core 113), except as
noted below. It doesn’t have any specific memories from the
target, but it can use information about the creature gained from
any of the casters to Impersonate the target. It looks exactly
like the target and has a Deception modifier to Impersonate that
creature equal to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who
rolled the Deception check, with a +4 status bonus.
Though it doesn’t have any of the original’s special abilities,
like a dragon’s breath, illusions allow it to appear to use those
abilities; they just never seem to have an effect. For instance,
against a double’s dragon’s breath, all creatures in the area seem
to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no damage.
Creatures can attempt to disbelieve the illusion by attempting
a Perception check against the Deception DC of the secondary
spellcaster who rolled the Deception check.
Critical Success You create the shadow double. It has the minion
trait and is under your absolute control. You gain a direct
mental link with the shadow double and can spend an action to
command the shadow double via this link, even at a distance.
Success As a critical success, but there is no special link between
you and the shadow double. You must spend an action to
command it verbally or by some other means.
Failure The ritual fails and has no effect.
Critical Failure The shadow double is created, but it isn’t your
minion and is hostile to all the casters. It does everything it
can to destroy them, but if it can’t immediately slay them, the
shadow double tries to escape and plots their demise.

## Teleportation Circle Ritual 7


## Uncommon Teleportation

Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense, precious metals, and purified chalk
worth 500 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary Checks
Crafting, Survival
Range 20 feet
Duration 1 day
You create a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground, which acts
as a portal to a destination determined at the time of the ritual.
You designate the destination of the teleportation as part of the
ritual. This destination can’t be changed. The destination must
be a location within 1,000 miles and be on the same plane as
the teleportation circle. You must be able to identify the location
precisely both by its position relative to the location where
you create the teleportation circle and by the destination’s
appearance (or other identifying features). The destination must
also be a 10-foot-diameter circle that doesn’t overlap with any
solid structures, but it can be a place that is harmful or dangerous.
A secondary caster attempting a Survival check for this ritual
can be located at the destination, instead of at the point of origin.
If the secondary caster succeeds at their check at the destination
and you roll a success, the ritual is a critical success instead.
While the circle is active, any creature that moves to be fully
within the circle is instantly teleported to the destination. A
creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will
save to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature
must attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns.

The circle normally works only in one direction, though you
can double the Cost to make it work in both directions.
Critical Success You create the teleportation circle, and it’s
extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled.
Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point.
Success As a critical success, but the destination is off target by
roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum of
10 miles off target.
Failure The teleportation circle doesn’t function.
Critical Failure The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate. It
leads to a random destination roughly the same distance
from the origin point, and the chances of some other unusual
mishap are much greater.
Heightened (9th) The cost is 2,000 gp, the duration is 1 month,
and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet.
Heightened (10th) The cost is 10,000 gp, the duration is unlimited,
and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet.

## Ward Domain Ritual 6


## Uncommon

Cast 1 day; Cost rare incenses, oils, and powdered silver, worth
150 gp total; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana, Nature, or Occultism (master); Secondary
Checks Lore (any), Survival, Thievery
Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 50 feet high
Duration 1 week
This ritual has long been used to guard the private sanctums of
powerful rulers, spellcasters, and other figures of import. You
and the other casters spend the casting time burning incense,
anointing doorframes, and drawing lines of powered silver
across entryways. The ritual creates the following magical
effects within the area; these effects are heightened to the rank
of ward domain and remain throughout the duration.
All gates, doors, windows, and similar apertures in the area
(if any) are locked, with the effects of lock. In addition, you can
obscure up to six doors, doorways, or similar entrances within
the area with the effects of illusory object to appear as plain
walls. Scrying spells can’t perceive any stimuli from the area,
and ward domain attempts to counteract teleportation effects
into or out of the area, including attempts to summon creatures
into the area, using a modifier equal to the ritual’s save DC – 10.
A successful dispel magic used on a specific effect removes
only that effect (such as the lock effect on one window). A
successful detonate magic ends the entire ritual.
Critical Success You create the effects described above, and you
protect an area twice as large.
Success You create the effects described above.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The area becomes trapped and hostile to you
and your allies in a way you didn’t anticipate.
Heightened (+1) The ward covers an additional area 100 feet ×
100 feet, up to 50 feet high, contiguous with the original area.
