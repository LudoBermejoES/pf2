training provides insight into any situation.

philosophies. You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a monk. Abilities gained at higher
levels list the requisite levels next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Flurry of Blows
You can attack rapidly with the Flurry of Blows action.
### Flurry Of Blows [one-action]

## Flourish Monk

Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine
their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As a
flourish ability, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.
Monk Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a monk class feat. These begin on page 118.
Powerful Fist
Your fists are deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist
increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. You don’t take the normal
–2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with
your fist or any other unarmed attacks.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Incredible Movement 3rd
You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status
bonus to your Speed whenever you’re not wearing armor.
The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have
beyond 3rd.
Mystic Strikes 3rd
Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues
them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become
magical, allowing them to get past resistances to nonmagical
attacks. However, you still need an item such
as handwraps of mighty blows to gain an item bonus to
attack rolls or increase your attacks’ weapon damage dice.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in
one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency
rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at
15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill
in which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

Expert Strikes 5th
You’ve practiced martial arts and have now surpassed your
former skill. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks
and simple weapons increase to expert. When you get a
critical hit with an unarmed attack in the brawling group,
you get its critical specialization effect.
Perception Expertise 5th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Path to Perfection 7th
You have progressed along your own path to enlightenment.
Choose your Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throw. Your
proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases
to master. When you roll a success on the chosen saving
throw, you get a critical success instead.
Weapon Specialization 7th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
4 if you’re legendary.
Metal Strikes 9th
You can adjust your body to strike with the mystic energy of
rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron
and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety
of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.
Monk Expertise 9th
Your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to
expert. If you have qi spells, your proficiency rank for spell
attacks and spell DCs increases to expert.
Second Path to Perfection 11th
You’ve learned to find perfection in every success. Choose
a different saving throw than the one you chose for your
path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen
saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with
the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.
Graceful Mastery 13th
You move with perpetual grace, turning aside blows. Your
proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.
Master Strikes 13th
You’ve honed your body into an even deadlier weapon.
Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple
weapons increase to master.
Greater Weapon Specialization 15th
Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
Third Path to Perfection 15th
You have made great progress in your personal studies
of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws
you selected for path to perfection or second path to
perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen type of
save increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure
on the chosen type of save, you get a failure instead. When
you roll a failure on the chosen type of save against an
effect that deals damage, you take half damage.
Adamantine Strikes 17th
When you focus your will into your limbs, your blows
are as unyielding as the hardest of metals. Your unarmed
attacks are treated as adamantine.
Graceful Legend 17th
Your sublime movement grants you unparalleled protection
and offense. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense
increases to legendary, and your proficiency rank for your
monk class DC increases to master. If you have qi spells,
your proficiency rank for spell attack modifiers and spell
DCs increases to master.

You have purged incompetence from your techniques. On
your first Strike of your turn, if you roll lower than 10, you
can treat the attack roll as a 10. This is a fortune effect.
Monk Feats
Every level at which you gain a monk feat, select one of the
following feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites before
taking the feat.

## 1St Level

### Crane Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
Your arms flutter like a crane’s wings. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing
attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling
group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for High Jump
and Long Jump by 5, and when you Leap, you can move an
additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
### Dragon Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes
like a lashing dragon’s tail. You can make dragon tail attacks
that deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling
group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of
difficult terrain while Striding.
### Monastic Archer Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored and wielding a longbow, a
shortbow, or a bow with the monk trait.
You enter a specialized stance for a unique martial art centered
around the use of a bow. While in this stance, the only Strikes
you can make are those using longbows, shortbows, or bows
with the monk trait. You can use Flurry of Blows with these
bows. You can use your other monk feats or monk abilities
that normally require unarmed attacks with these bows when
attacking within half the first range increment (normally 50
feet for a longbow and 30 feet for a shortbow), so long as the
feat or ability doesn’t require a single, specific Strike.
Special When you select this feat, you become trained in the
longbow, shortbow, and any simple and martial bows with
the monk trait. If you gain the expert strikes class feature,
your proficiency rank for these weapons increases to
expert, and if you gain the master strikes class feature, your
proficiency rank for these weapons increases to master.

## Monastic Weaponry Feat 1


## Monk

You have trained with the weaponry of your monastery
or school. You gain access to uncommon weapons with
the monk trait and become trained in simple and martial
monk weapons. When your proficiency for unarmed attacks
increases to expert or master, your proficiency rank for
these weapons increases to expert or master as well. If
you have familiarity with an agile or finesse weapon
(such as from the Catfolk Weapon Familiarity feat),
that weapon also gains the monk trait for you.
You can use melee monk weapons with any of your
monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed
attacks, though not if the feat or ability requires you to use a
single specific type of attack, such as Crane Stance.
If you gain the critical specialization benefit for unarmed
attacks—with the expert strikes class feature, for example—
you also gain it with monk weapons.
### Mountain Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored and touching the ground.

You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—a technique
created by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with
the weight of an avalanche and block blows with your
garments. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone
unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are
in the brawling group; and have the forceful, nonlethal, and
unarmed traits.
While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 item bonus to
AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against
Reposition, Shove, Trip, and other forced movement effects.
You have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning
you don’t add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are
all reduced by 5 feet. The item bonus to AC from Mountain
Stance is cumulative with armor potency runes on your
explorer’s clothing, mystic armor, and bands of force.

## Qi Spells Feat 1


## Monk

You have cultivated your qi to produce magical effects. You
gain inner upheaval, qi rush, or another 1st-rank monk qi spell
you have access to. The rules for qi spells are summarized in
the sidebar on this page, and qi spells appear on page 257.
### Stumbling Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Prerequisite trained in Deception
You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the
movements of the inebriated—bobbing, weaving, leaving
false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true
movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to Deception checks to Feint. The only Strikes you can
make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8
bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the
agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If
an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance,
it becomes off-guard against the next stumbling swing Strike
you make against it before the end of your next turn.
### Tiger Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a tiger and can make tiger claw attacks.
These deal 1d8 slashing damage; are in the brawling group;
and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. On a
critical success with your tiger claws, if you deal damage, the
target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage.
As long as your Speed is at least 20 feet while in Tiger
Stance, you can Step 10 feet.
### Wolf Stance [one-action] FEAT 1

## Monk Stance

Requirements You are unarmored.
You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands
held like fangs. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These
deal 1d8 piercing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the
agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
If you’re flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your wolf jaw
unarmed attacks also gain the trip trait.

## 2Nd Level


## Crushing Grab Feat 2


## Monk

Like a powerful constrictor, you crush targets in your unyielding
grasp. When you successfully Grapple a creature, you can deal
bludgeoning damage to that creature equal to your Strength
modifier. You can make this attack nonlethal with no penalty.

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many monk abilities.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.
You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Incapacitation: An ability with this trait can take
a character out of the fight. But when you use an
incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level
than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack
roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of
success of its saving throws for that effect by one step.
Qi Spells: By tapping into an inner reserve of energy,
called qi, you can cast special spells called qi spells, which
are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a
focus spell. When you gain your first qi spell, you decide
whether your qi spells are divine or occult spells, and you
become trained in spell attack modifiers and spell DCs;
your key spellcasting attribute is Wisdom. You also gain
a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool
during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus
Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to
steady your mind and breath to draw in more qi from the
world around you.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. The maximum Focus Points your focus
pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you
have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules
for focus spells appear on page 298 of Player Core.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you
enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action
again, whichever comes first. After you take an action that
has the stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round.
You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
You can Dismiss a stance.
Venomous: These weapons inject poison into every hit.
When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an
additional 1 persistent poison damage. This increases to
2 persistent poison damage if the weapon has a greater
striking rune.

119


## Dancing Leaf Feat 2


## Monk

You are as light as a leaf on the breeze. When you Leap or
succeed at a High Jump or Long Jump, increase the distance
you jump by 5 feet. When calculating the damage you take
from falling, don’t count any distance fallen while you are
adjacent to a wall.

## Elemental Fist Feat 2


## Monk

Prerequisites inner upheaval
You can color your qi in bright elemental energy. When
you cast inner upheaval, in addition to the damage types
normally available, you can deliver the extra damage with
elemental magic, adding the element’s trait and changing
the damage type to the listed one: air electricity (sparking
gust), earth bludgeoning (chunk of stone), fire fire (flickering
flame), metal slashing (flying metal shards), water cold
(wave of frigid water), or wood bludgeoning (pummeling
pine cones).
### Shooting Stars Stance [one-action] FEAT 2

## Monk Stance

Prerequisite Monastic Weaponry
You enter a stance that lets you throw shuriken with lightning
speed. While in this stance, you can use your monk feats or
monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks with
shuriken instead.

with a greater range).
Once you’ve made a thrown Strike with such a weapon, you
can use the precision of your throw to make additional strikes

Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
You have mastered an ultimate grappling technique capable
of breaking even the mightiest of foes. You hurl the creature

and then make an unarmed Strike. If the Strike is successful,
you can repeat this process up to two more times, moving the
creature an additional 20 feet directly up into the air with
each Strike; the creature keeps the grabbed or restrained
condition throughout the sequence. If you miss with any of the
Strikes, Godbreaker and the grabbed or restrained condition
immediately end and both you and the opponent fall, taking

127

Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and
servitude—you instead glean sacred truths and great mysteries embodied in
overarching concepts, whether because you perceive the common ground across
multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these
mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with
a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it, which you might
uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as punishment from the gods.
