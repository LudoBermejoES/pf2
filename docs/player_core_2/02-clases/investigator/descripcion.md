During combat encounters...
Your keen insights regarding your foes make you more dangerous than
your physical strength would suggest. After spending a moment to study
your enemies, your perceptiveness allows you to act quickly, striking them
where it hurts most. You often assist tougher members of your party, wisely
protecting yourself while providing vital aid.
During social encounters...
Few can stand up against your scrutiny. You might not be the most charming,
but you see things for what they really are and develop an understanding of
a social situation rapidly. Every conversation is an investigation, after all,
and you never know what you might uncover!
While exploring...
You look for clues in your environment. You often prove yourself to be a valuable
ally by serving as a party scout, analyzing the intricacies of puzzles or mysterious
phenomena, and pursuing leads that could reveal beneficial information.
In downtime...
You study up on subjects new and old, make new allies you can share
information with, and pursue hobbies that keep your active mind satisfied.
You might make a bit of coin on the side working as a private detective or
consulting with the local constabulary.
You might...
- Start asking questions—including several that are quite involved—
immediately after you’re presented with a conundrum.
- Strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and
to identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes.
- Get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them
trivial.
Others probably...
- Find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if
difficult to fully comprehend.
- Get a bit annoyed that you’re such a know-it-all.
- Rely on you to solve mysteries, puzzles, or other challenges requiring
intellectual curiosity and reasoning.

On the Case
As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases
waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one
reaction you can use to investigate cases: Pursue a Lead
and Clue In.

## Pursue A Lead


## Concentrate Exploration Investigator

You name one detail you’ve identified that you think is part
of a larger mystery, then spend 1 minute examining it. The
detail is typically either obvious or something you’ve already
discovered using Recall Knowledge, Sense Motive, Gather
Information, or a similar action. After the minute passes, the
GM either confirms there’s a larger mystery or tells you there’s
nothing more to learn (the detail is inconsequential or you
know all the information already). If there is in fact a larger
mystery at play, you can’t Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes,
but you can choose to open an investigation. To do so, define
the question at the heart of the mystery, such as “Where has
the priceless work of art that was supposed to hang here been
taken?” or “Who or what killed this priest?” Work with your
GM to refine the question if need be. You can also give your
investigation a name to better keep track of it (such as “The
Case of the Cheated Goblin” or “The Skinsaw Murders”).
Investigation Bonus Whenever you attempt a Perception
check or skill check to attempt to get closer to answering
the question at the heart of an active investigation, you gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks
this applies to depend on the actions you use to investigate
and are determined by the GM, but checks to investigate
are typically Perception checks or skill checks that use
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
Active Investigations You can maintain two active
investigations at a time. If you Pursue another Lead after
that, the case must be different from any of your current
investigations (as far as you are aware), and you give up on
a current investigation of your choice. Once you’ve given up
pursuit of an investigation, you can’t Pursue a Lead into it again
until after the next time you make your daily preparations.
Solving an Investigation If you answer the question at
the heart of your investigation, the GM tells you that you’ve
done so. You don’t lose the bonus or other benefits until you
choose to close the investigation by Pursuing a Lead again
or voluntarily Dismissing it. If what you discover points
to an even larger mystery, you can work with the GM to
adapt the question and name of the investigation to the
new information.

### Clue In [reaction]

## Concentrate Investigator

Frequency once per 10 minutes
Trigger Another creature attempts a check that could help
get you closer to answering the question at the heart of
one of your active investigations.
You share information with the triggering creature. They
gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your
investigation bonus from Pursue a Lead. The GM can
add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the
situation, such as auditory and linguistic if you’re conveying
information verbally.
Devise a Stratagem
You can play out a battle in your head, using brains
rather than brawn to execute an attack.
DEVISE A STRATAGEM [one-action] OR [free-action]

## Concentrate Fortune Investigator

Frequency once per round
You assess a foe’s weaknesses in combat and use them to
formulate a plan of attack. Choose a creature you can see.
You can Devise a Stratagem as a free action if you’re aware
that creature could help answer the question at the heart of
one of your active investigations. Roll a d20, then decide on
an attack stratagem or skill stratagem.
Attack Stratagem If you Strike the chosen creature before the
start of your next turn, you must use the result of the d20
roll for your Strike’s attack roll instead of rolling. You make
this substitution only for the first Strike you make against
the creature this round, not any subsequent ones. When
you make this substitution, you can add your Intelligence
modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or
Dexterity modifier, provided you Strike with an agile or
finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack,
a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it’s a
melee weapon with the thrown trait), or a sap.
Skill Stratagem You can’t attempt to Strike the target until the
start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to your next Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based
skill check or Perception check involving the target before
the start of your next turn. If you would gain your Pursue
a Lead investigation bonus to such a check, that bonus
increases by 1 instead of you gaining the +1 bonus listed.
Methodology
Your studies have made you savvy in a broad spectrum
of areas, but one particular investigative process drew
your intense—even obsessive—interest. Choose a
methodology. The methodologies presented in this book
are as follows.
Alchemical Sciences
Your methodology emphasizes chemical and alchemical
analysis, collecting information from unusual particles
and fluids found on the scene. You possess enough
alchemical know-how to whip up a few tinctures to help
you with your cases.
You’re trained in Crafting and gain the Alchemical
Crafting skill feat (Player Core 252). You start with a
standard formula book (Player Core 288), which contains
the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items
of your choice (these must be elixirs or tools), in addition
to the formulas gained from Alchemical Crafting. Each
time you gain a level, you learn the formula for one
common alchemical elixir or alchemical tool of any level
of item you can create. Alchemical elixirs and tools begin
on pages 286 and 295, respectively.
During your daily preparations, you can create a
number of versatile vials equal to your Intelligence
modifier. Statistics for versatile vials appear on page 58
of the alchemist class.
You gain the Quick Tincture action, which you can
use to turn one of these vials into an elixir or alchemical
tool for which you know the formula. If you have the
ability to create versatile vials from more than one
source (such as the alchemist multiclass archetype), you
can use any of your versatile vials for any ability you
have that requires them.
### Quick Tincture [one-action]

## Investigator Manipulate

Cost 1 versatile vial
Requirements You know the formula for the alchemical item
you’re creating, you are holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit, and you have a free hand.
You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You create a single
alchemical elixir or tool of your level or lower that’s in your
formula book without having to spend the normal monetary
cost in alchemical raw materials or needing to attempt a
Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains
potent only until the end of the current turn.

## What Can I Investigate?

The detail you can investigate is typically a single
item, creature, or small location (such as a room or
corridor), though the GM might allow a different scope
for your investigation. Physical clues are usually the
best starting point, but the GM might allow you to start
an investigation from a rumor you learned or a similar
clue. For instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough
to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty
sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your
investigation of that subject. The question at the heart
of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not
answerable through quick observation or a single die
roll. “Is this footprint made of mud?” is simple for an
investigator to answer, but “Who left these footprints?”
or “What location did this mud come from?” both have
enough potential for an investigation.

103

Empiricism
Everything comes down to data. Calculating statistics,
running numbers, and using inductive reasoning allows
you to determine the most likely outcome of any
scenario, and anything out of place draws your keen
attention.
You are trained in one Intelligence-based skill of
your choice. You gain the That’s Odd investigator feat
(page 107), and you gain the Expeditious Inspection
free action.
### Expeditious Inspection [free-action]

## Investigator

Frequency once per 10 minutes
You observe and assess your surroundings with great speed.
You Recall Knowledge, Seek, or Sense Motive.
Forensic Medicine
You’ve learned that in most cases, especially murders,
criminals tend to leave more evidence of the crime on
the body than they’d like to believe. Information from
bruising, bone fractures, blood spatters, and even the life
cycle of carrion insects can provide valuable clues that
help reconstruct the scene.
You’re trained in Medicine and gain the Forensic
Acumen (page 230) and Battle Medicine (Player Core
253) skill feats. When you use Battle Medicine, on a
success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to
your level, and the target becomes temporarily immune
for only 1 hour, not 1 day.
Interrogation
People can’t help but trust you, whether through your
inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking
to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others
talking, and you’ve developed interrogative techniques
to help you get to the truth of your investigations.
You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the No
Cause for Alarm skill feat (Player Core 259). You
can also Pursue a Lead at the same time you Make an
Impression, as long as you ask a question related to the
creature with which you’re conversing or a topic of your
conversation. You also gain the Pointed Question action.
### Pointed Question [one-action]
### Auditory Concentrate Investigator Linguistic Mental
You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the
right way. Ask a question of a non-allied creature that you can
see. Attempt a Diplomacy check against the creature’s Will
DC. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target must directly answer your
question. It doesn’t have to answer truthfully, but you
gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if
the creature attempts to Lie to you. Whether it answers
truthfully or not, you glean something from its body
language, and it is off-guard to the Strike you make using
Devise a Stratagem against it before the end of your turn.
Success As critical success, but the circumstance bonus to
your Perception DC is +2.
Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
Critical Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal,
and its attitude toward you decreases by one step due to
your aggravating attention.
Investigator Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an
investigator class feat. These begin on page 106.
Strategic Strike
When you strike carefully and with forethought, you
deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your
Intelligence modifier to your attack roll due to Devising a
Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.

As your investigator level increases, so too does the
deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number
of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Skill Increases 2nd
You gain more skill increases than members of other
classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you
gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either
become trained in one skill you’re untrained in or to
become an expert in one skill in which you’re already
trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Keen Recollection 3rd
You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren’t
your specialty. Your proficiency bonus to untrained
skill checks to Recall Knowledge is equal to your level
instead of +0.
Skillful Lessons 3rd
At 3rd level and every odd-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a skill feat. This feat must be for an Intelligence-,
Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, or for the skill you
gained from your methodology.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you
gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
thereafter.
Weapon Expertise 5th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies
of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks
increase to expert.
Vigilant Senses 7th
Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen
awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank
in Perception increases to master.
Weapon Specialization 7th
You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you
know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons
and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This
damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if
you’re legendary.
Fortitude Expertise 9th
Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures.
Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to
expert.
Investigator Expertise 9th
You’ve refined your investigative techniques to an
exceptional degree. Your circumstance bonus from
Pursue a Lead increases to +2. Your proficiency rank for
your investigator class DC increases to expert.
Deductive Improvisation 11th
You use your skills at deduction to perform whatever
task is necessary to solve the case. You can attempt any
check that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if
you’re untrained in it; you can attempt any check that
requires you to have expert proficiency in a skill so long
as you’re trained in it; and you can attempt any check
that requires you to have master proficiency in a skill as
long as you have expert proficiency in it.
Dogged Will 11th
In your pursuit of truth and knowledge, you won’t be
dissuaded. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases
to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you
get a critical success instead.
Incredible Senses 13th
You notice things that are almost impossible for an
ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for
Perception increases to legendary.
Light Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and
unarmored defense increase to expert.

Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
Savvy Reflexes 15th

yourself out of harm’s way. Your proficiency rank for

on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.

105

Greater Dogged Will 17th
Your willpower becomes truly unbreakable. Your
proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary.
When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical
success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save,
you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save
against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
Light Armor Mastery 19th
Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your
ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light
armor and unarmored defense increase to master.
Master Detective 19th
As a master detective, you can solve any case and find all
the clues available. Your reputation precedes you, and
even the most skilled criminals and deceivers fear you.
Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC
increases to master.
In addition, if you enter a new location that includes
another clue toward answering the question at the heart
of one of your active investigations, the GM informs
you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object,
person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue,
the GM informs you that you’ve done so.
If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM
chooses one to inform you about. When you find any
of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that
you’ve done so, even if it wasn’t the clue they’d chosen
or there are other clues you haven’t found.
Investigator Feats
At every level that you gain an investigator feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level

### Eliminate Red Herrings  FEAT 1

## Investigator

You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry.
When you roll a critical failure on a skill check to Recall
Knowledge related to a question about one of your active
investigations, you get a failure instead.

## Flexible Studies Feat 1


## Investigator

You’ve collected a cross-section of information on various
disciplines you can refer to when preparing for various tasks.
During your daily preparations, you can cram on a certain
subject to become temporarily trained in one skill of your
choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. As this
proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for
a permanent character option like a skill increase or a feat.

## Known Weaknesses Feat 1


## Investigator

Whenever you Devise a Stratagem, you can also attempt a
check to Recall Knowledge as part of that action before rolling
the d20. If you critically succeed at the Recall Knowledge
check, you notice a weakness and can convey the information

to allies to grant each of them a +1 circumstance bonus to their
next attack roll against the subject, as long as their attack is
made before the beginning of your next turn. If you choose
an attack stratagem, this bonus applies to that attack roll too.

## Takedown Expert Feat 1


## Investigator

You’ve mastered combat practices that let you get up close and
bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence
modifier on attack rolls for an attack stratagem if you’re using
a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club or staff),
in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for
your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any of your
Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal –2 penalty.

## That’S Odd Feat 1


## Investigator

When you enter a new location, such as a room or corridor,
you immediately notice one thing out of the ordinary. The GM
determines what it is, or whether there’s nothing reasonable
to pick up, skipping obvious clues that can be easily noticed
without a check or specifically looking for them. You learn only
that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it’s suspicious.
For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain
on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it’s
evident to you already, so the GM might note that there’s
something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You
would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out
what specifically is out of the ordinary. If you wish, you can
Pursue a Lead concerning this detail even if you have Pursed a
Lead less than 10 minutes ago.
That’s Odd doesn’t reveal whether creatures are suspicious.
You don’t typically get any benefit when you leave and come
back to a place, though if a major change has happened there
and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do.

## Trap Finder Feat 1


## Investigator

You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers
and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by
traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren’t Searching,
you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be
Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to
find the trap.
You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery,
you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against
traps increase to +2.

## Underworld Investigator Feat 1


## Investigator

Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the
criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you
might have gained an understanding of how they operate from
the outside. You become trained in Underworld Lore, and you
gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus to Thievery checks
to investigate a case (such as checks to Steal a clue from a
suspect or Pick a Lock to open a safe with damning documents).

## 2Nd Level


## Athletic Strategist Feat 2


## Investigator

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body
weight. In addition to using an attack stratagem’s roll
substitution for a Strike, you can use it to modify a Disarm,
Grapple, Reposition, Shove, or Trip attempt, substituting your
Devise a Stratagem roll for the Athletics check. You must apply
the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether
it’s a Strike or one of the Athletics actions.
You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of
Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your
Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you’re using a weapon for the
maneuver and the weapon doesn’t fit the restrictions for using
Intelligence with a stratagem.

## Certain Stratagem Feat 2


## Investigator

You know exactly where to strike a foe to target their weak
spots. When you make a Strike that you’re adding your
Intelligence modifier to due to Devising a Stratagem and miss,
you deal half of your strategic strike damage to the target.
This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you
used for the Strike.
### Exploit Blunder [reaction] FEAT 2

## Investigator

Trigger A creature you Devised a Stratagem against on your
most recent turn fails or critically fails a Strike against you.
By watching your foes closely, you can make the most out of
their mistakes. You Step.
### Person Of Interest [one-action] FEAT 2

## Investigator

Frequency once per 10 minutes
Sometimes, you need to follow the leads as they come in
the middle of an investigation. Choose a creature that you
can see who isn’t, to your knowledge, tied to any of your
current investigations. For the next minute, you can Devise a
Stratagem against that creature as a free action.

## Shared Stratagem Feat 2


## Investigator

The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself.
When you hit a creature with an attack on which you
substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
designate one ally. The creature you hit is off-guard to that ally
on the next attack that ally makes against that creature before
the start of your next turn.

107


## Solid Lead Feat 2


## Investigator

Sometimes your case splinters into smaller mysteries, but
you never lose sight of the big picture. Once per day when
you give up on the subject of a lead due to using Pursue a
Lead again, you can designate the lead you stopped pursuing
as your solid lead for the day. Even though you stopped
following the solid lead, you can change back to your solid
lead any number of times by using a single action, which
has the concentrate trait. Doing so ends one of your current
leads as normal.
During your next daily preparations, you can maintain
your solid lead or you can remove it; removing it allows you
to designate a new solid lead later that day.

## 4Th Level


## Alchemical Discoveries Feat 4


## Investigator

Prerequisites alchemical sciences methodology
You’ve devoted extra time in the lab to improve your
knowledge of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two
alchemical items each time you level up instead of one; these
must still be elixirs or tools. The number of versatile vials you
can create each day increases by one if you’re an expert in
Crafting, two if you’re a master, or three if you’re legendary.

## Detective’S Readiness Feat 4


## Investigator

When you’re on a case, you stay watchful and resolute to avoid
tricks your suspect might pull. You gain your investigation
bonus from Pursue a Lead on saving throws (and their DCs,
as normal) against creatures or effects that are related to
the question at the heart of an open investigation, and you
can use Clue In to assist an ally’s saving throw against that
creature or effect.

## Lie Detector Feat 4


## Investigator

Prerequisites empiricism or interrogation methodology
You’re adept at noticing the tells of a liar—sweat, flushing,
a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive and
to Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you. When you
determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to
your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next
Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check you
attempt against that creature within the next minute.
If you would gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus
to any of the above checks, that bonus increases by 1 instead
of you gaining the +1 bonus listed.

## Ongoing Investigation Feat 4


## Investigator

You’re always investigating what’s around you, even as you
perform other activities. You can move at full Speed while

## Coroner

When someone finds a body, you’re first on the scene. You
share the clues you learn through keen observation with
your team to ensure you always apprehend the culprit.

another exploration activity while Investigating.

## Scalpel’S Point Feat 4


## Investigator

Prerequisites forensic medicine methodology
Your stratagems benefit from your precise knowledge of
anatomy. When you critically hit with an attack on which
you substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
if your attack dealt piercing or slashing damage, you also
deal 1d6 persistent bleed damage to your target.

## Strategic Assessment Feat 4


## Investigator

You learn your foes’ strengths and weaknesses by watching
them move. When you hit a creature with a Strike on which
you substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
the GM chooses one of the following pieces of information
about the enemy to tell you.
- Which of the enemy’s weaknesses is highest
- Which of the enemy’s resistances is highest
- Which of the enemy’s saving throws is lowest
- One immunity the enemy has
The GM can choose deliberately or at random, but they
can’t choose information that doesn’t apply (such as choosing
an immunity for an enemy that has no immunities). This
applies only the first time you hit a given creature.

## 6Th Level

### Connect The Dots [two-actions] FEAT 6

## Auditory Concentrate Investigator Linguistic

Ephemeral connections between people, places, and concepts
are invisible to most, but seeing them is your stock and trade.
Choose an ally and a non-allied creature. You must be able
to see both of them. You briefly study the way they both
move and attempt a Perception check against the higher
of the non-allied creature’s Deception DC or Will DC. Both
targets are then temporarily immune to Connect the Dots for
10 minutes.
Critical Success You spot a way for your ally to take advantage
of the other target’s flaws and let them know about it. Your
ally gains your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus as a
circumstance bonus to all its Strikes or skill checks against
the creature until the start of your next turn.
Success As critical success, but your ally gains the bonus
only for their next Strike or skill check against the creature.
Failure You fail to make a connection.
Critical Failure You misconstrue a vital piece of information,
which temporarily disconcerts you. You are stupefied 1
until the end of your next turn.

## Predictive Purchase Feat 6


## Investigator

You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the Prescient
Planner and Prescient Consumable feats (Player Core 260).
When using Prescient Planner, you can pull out the item
as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or a similar
container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.

## Thorough Research Feat 6


## Investigator

You have comprehensive knowledge in your fields of interest.
When you succeed at a Recall Knowledge check, you gain
additional information or context. When you critically
succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, you get additional
information or context or can ask an additional follow-up
question (the GM chooses which).

## 8Th Level


## Blind-Fight Feat 8


## Investigator

Prerequisites master in Perception
Your battle insights make you more aware of concealed
and invisible opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat
check to target concealed creatures. You’re not off-guard
to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you’re offguard
to them for reasons other than the hidden condition),
and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a
hidden creature.
While you’re adjacent to an undetected creature of your
level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
### Clue Them All In  FEAT 8

## Investigator

You can clue in all your allies at once. When you use the Clue
In reaction, any of your allies who are attempting the same
check to investigate one of your active investigations receive
the circumstance bonus from Clue In. If you use this ability
during an encounter, they must attempt their check within 1
round of when you Clued them In.

## Defensive Stratagem Feat 8


## Investigator

By scrutinizing a foe, you learn how to better avoid its
attacks. When you use Devise a Stratagem, you can choose
a defensive stratagem instead of an attack or skill stratagem
after you roll a d20.
Defensive Stratagem You can’t attempt to Strike the target
until the start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to all your defenses against effects caused by the
target until the start of your next turn.

## Whodunnit? Feat 8


## Uncommon Investigator

Frequency once per day
You carefully consider your case and narrow down some
of the details. When you Pursue a Lead and learn there’s a
larger mystery, you can ask two questions related to your
investigation when you open it. The GM must answer truthfully
with “yes” or “no,” though if the answer would be misleading

109

or have no practical application to your investigation, the GM
can answer “immaterial.” You can’t use Whodunnit? more than
once for the same lead, even across different days.
Your questions must come from the following list, applying
to the detail that spurred your investigation.
- Was this clue left by a [creature trait]? (Choose a creature
trait such as humanoid, undead, or dwarf; this trait must
be accurate as of the time the clue was left.)
- Was this clue left within the last hour?
- Was this clue left within the last day?
- Was the creature that left this clue in a heightened
emotional state when it left the clue?
- Did anyone attempt to conceal this clue?

## 10Th Level

### Just One More Thing [one-action] FEAT 10

## Fortune Investigator

Requirements Your most recent action was to Demoralize,
Feint, or Request, and you failed but didn’t critically fail.
After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you
add another bit of information or ask a pointed question,
possibly salvaging your previous attempt. Reroll the failed
check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check
is involved with one of your active investigations, double your
investigation bonus from Pursue a Lead on the rerolled check.
That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing
for 1 day.
You can also use this action if you failed, but didn’t critically
fail, at a check to Lie, Gather Information, Make an Impression,
or Coerce. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding
Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you
initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.

## Ongoing Strategy Feat 10


## Investigator

Prerequisites strategic strike
You’re constantly studying small aspects of everyone’s
movements, even if you don’t have a stratagem in place
ahead of time. On any Strike for which you didn’t Devise a
Stratagem, you still deal precision damage equal to your
number of strategic strike damage dice so long as the weapon
or unarmed attack you used is one that would have let you use
your Intelligence modifier had you Devised a Stratagem.
### Suspect Of Opportunity [reaction] FEAT 10

## Investigator

Prerequisites Person of Interest
Trigger A creature who isn’t, to your knowledge, tied to any
of your active investigations takes a hostile action against
you in combat.
Sometimes something intrudes upon your case unexpectedly,
such as an ambush sent to bring your investigation to a close.
You use Person of Interest against the triggering creature. This
doesn’t allow you to use Person of Interest more frequently
than normal.

## Analyst

Eyes ever open and mind ever turning, you single out
clues and pursue them until you find the truth.
Attributes
Prioritize Intelligence to prepare a panoply of facts and
figures. Wisdom lets you sense every clue and danger,
and Dexterity keeps you safe and active in combat.

Sample Investigator


## 12Th Level


## Empiricist’S Eye Feat 12


## Investigator

Prerequisites empiricism methodology
Sharp and piercing, your eyes see all and convey more. Your
Point Out actions lose the auditory trait, and you don’t need to
be heard to convey the information to your allies. In addition, a
creature you Point Out is off-guard to your allies until the start
of your next turn.
Special If you have the Blind-Fight feat, your allies gain that
feat’s benefits against any creature that’s off-guard due to
Empiricist’s Eye.
### Foresee Danger [reaction] FEAT 12

## Concentrate Investigator

Trigger A creature targets you with an attack, and you can see
the attacker.
You perceive every possible way your foe’s attack could land
and attempt to avoid them all. The triggering attack roll targets
your Perception DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you
to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any
conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example,
an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to
you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn’t take the –2
circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
### Just As Planned [free-action] FEAT 12

## Fortune Investigator

Frequency once per hour
In the blink of an eye, you calculate your enemy’s movements
and know exactly where to aim your next blow. If your next
action is to Devise a Stratagem, you can roll the d20 twice
and take the higher result.
MAKE ’EM SWEAT FEAT 12

## Investigator

Prerequisites interrogation methodology
Your line of questioning lets a suspect know you can
see right through them, shaking them to the core. When
you succeed at using Pointed Question, the target is also
frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical success). This
added effect is an emotion and fear effect, but the other
effects of Pointed Question still apply even if the target is
immune to fear.
### Reason Rapidly [one-action] FEAT 12

## Investigator

Your mind works through clues at an unbelievable speed. You
instantly use up to five Recall Knowledge actions. If you have
any special abilities or free actions that would normally be
triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can’t use them
for these actions.

111

### Share Tincture [one-action] FEAT 12

## Investigator

Prerequisites alchemical sciences methodology
You use Quick Tincture, and the item you create remains
potent until the start of your next turn. Then you can
Interact to pass the item to another creature. If you pass it by
throwing it, your ranged attack automatically succeeds. You
must have a versatile vial to use Quick Tincture, as normal.
### Surgical Shock [one-action] FEAT 12

## Attack Investigator

Prerequisites forensic medicine methodology
With a few well-placed jabs with your fist or weapon, you
render your opponent disoriented or ungainly. Attempt a
Medicine check against the Fortitude DC of a target within
your reach. The result of your check determines the severity
of the condition you inflict.
Critical Success The target is either clumsy 3 or stupefied 3
until the end of your next turn. The target is then immune
to Surgical Shock for 1 hour.
Success As critical success, but the target is either clumsy 2
or stupefied 2.
Failure The target is minorly inconvenienced. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to the next attack action you attempt
against it before the end of your turn.
Critical Failure The target is unaffected and you overextend
yourself, triggering reactions as if you had used a
manipulate action.

## 14Th Level

### Plot The Future  FEAT 14

## Uncommon Concentrate Investigator Prediction

You spend 10 minutes in contemplation to uncannily predict
how events will play out. Choose a particular goal or activity
you plan to engage in within 1 week, or an event you expect
might happen within 1 week. You analyze whether it’s likely
to come to pass, learning whether it’s highly likely, somewhat
likely, somewhat unlikely, or highly unlikely. You also gain a
piece of advice suggesting a course of action you or your
allies could take that might make the chosen event more or
less likely, whichever you prefer. The GM determines the
likeliness of the event and the piece of advice you learn.
### Sense The Unseen [reaction] FEAT 14

## Investigator

Trigger You fail a check to Seek.
When you look for foes, you notice the slightest of cues. Even
though you failed at the triggering check, you automatically
sense any undetected creatures in the area where you’re
Seeking, making them merely hidden to you.

## Strategic Bypass Feat 14


## Investigator

Your plans account for your foes’ resistances, enabling
you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike on

## Chemist

With carefully formulated chemical compounds, you
find chemical clues at crime scenes and boost your
investigative acumen with mutagens and other elixirs.
Attributes

reasoning. Dexterity helps you stay out of harm’s way,
while Constitution keeps you healthy.

your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies
against your attack.

## 16Th Level


## Didactic Strike Feat 16


## Investigator

Prerequisites Shared Stratagem
When you find a glaring weakness, you can set your allies
up to annihilate your foe. When you use Shared Stratagem,
you can designate up to 10 allies instead of just one. The foe
is off-guard against the first attack from each designated ally
before your next turn, and each ally’s first attack deals an
extra 2d6 precision damage to the target if it hits.

## Implausible Purchase Feat 16


## Investigator

Prerequisites Predictive Purchase
It seems impossible, but you’ve analyzed every angle and are
able to just keep pulling out exactly the item you need, even
in far-flung locations. You can use Prescient Planner even if
you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can
use it as a single action instead of a 2-action activity, during
which you Interact to draw the item. In addition, five times
per day, you can use Prescient Planner to pull out a common
consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
### Reconstruct The Scene  FEAT 16

## Concentrate Investigator

You spend 1 minute surveying a small location (such as a
single room) to get an impression of events that occurred
there in the last day. This involves moving about the area and
studying footprints, the placement of objects, spilled drinks
or blood, and so forth.
You get an indistinct mental impression of significant
events that happened there. This gives you clues and details
of the past, including the overall events and their time frame,
but it’s not a perfect record. This also isn’t enough to identify
who was involved in these events if you weren’t already
aware the person was there.
As determined by the GM, you also pick out various
seemingly small details that could serve as important clues
you can use to Purse a Lead, like a memorable weapon
someone used for a murder or the type of cloak someone
wore when passing through.

## 18Th Level


## Lead Investigator Feat 18


## Exploration Investigator

Prerequisites Clue Them All In
You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one
of your open investigations. Those allies gain the same
circumstance bonus you do from Pursue a Lead to checks
to investigate the question at the heart of that investigation.
This bonus lasts until you cease Pursing that Lead or for 1
day, whichever comes first. This doesn’t confer any other
benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance
bonus to your saves with Detective’s Readiness.
TRICKSTER’S ACE [reaction] FEAT 18

## Concentrate Investigator

Trigger You specify the trigger when you make your daily
preparations (see Requirements below).
Requirements When you make your daily preparations, you
must specify a trigger for this reaction using the same
restrictions as the triggers for the Ready action. You also
choose a single spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or
primal list of 4th level or lower. The spell can’t have a cost,
nor can its casting time be more than 10 minutes. The spell
must be able to target a single creature, and you must be
a valid target for it.
Whether from jury-rigged magic items, deduction from the
study of magical interactions, or other means, you have a
contingency in your back pocket for desperate situations.
When the trigger occurs, you cause the spell to come into
effect. The spell targets only you, no matter how many
creatures it would affect normally. If you define particularly
complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger
might fail. Once the contingency is triggered, the spell is
expended until your next daily preparations.

## 20Th Level

EVERYONE’S A SUSPECT FEAT 20

## Investigator

You are so suspicious of everyone you meet that you keep
mental notes on how to defeat them all—even your own
allies. After interacting with a creature for at least 1 minute,
you automatically Pursue a Lead with that creature as the
subject. You can have any number of such leads at any given
time, and when you Pursue a Lead again, you don’t give up
any of these automatic subjects.
### Just The Facts  FEAT 20

## Investigator

Prerequisites Thorough Research
You fundamentally understand everything to the point where
your research can’t possibly be wrong. You are permanently
quickened and can use the extra action to Recall Knowledge. In
addition, you gain the following benefits with Recall Knowledge.
- Your checks to Recall Knowledge are no longer secret.
- When you Recall Knowledge, you use the outcome for one
degree of success better than the result of your check.
- If an effect (such as Dubious Knowledge) would give
you inaccurate information from your Recall Knowledge
check, you know which information is inaccurate.
- When one of your allies Recalls Knowledge and gains
false information, you also know that information is
inaccurate if they share it with you.
