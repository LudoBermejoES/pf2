During combat encounters...
You confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning
yourself to protect your allies.
During social encounters...
You are a voice of devoted authority, with strong intentions to embody the
behaviors your deity encourages.
While exploring...
You overcome barriers both physical and spiritual, providing inspiration to
your allies through your actions and—when your fellow adventurers ask for
it—providing guidance with a sure hand.
In downtime...
You spend much of your time in solemn prayer and contemplation, rigorous
training, and fulfilling the edicts of your cause, but that doesn’t mean there
isn’t time to take up a craft or hobby.
You might...
- Believe the righteousness of your cause will triumph, no matter how
grim the odds.
- Explain how the teachings of your deity apply to decisions and actions
in everyday life.
- Be a bit overprotective of your allies.
Others probably...
- See you as a symbol of your deity, and carry over their opinions of that
deity to you.
- Worry you secretly despise them for not living up to your impossible
standard, or that you are unwilling to compromise when necessary.
- Know that you’ve sworn divine oaths of service they can trust you to keep.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a champion. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Deity
As a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity
you revere above all others. The most common deities in
Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along
with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get
for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.
Skill
You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity.
As normal, if you’re already trained in that skill, you
become trained in a different skill of your choice.
Anathema
Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they
take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any
implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these
are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the
other players at the table—you’re still playing a nuanced
character, not strictly following a script.
Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals
are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells,
committing acts, and using items that are anathema to
your deity remove you from your deity’s good graces.
Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema
to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your
connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a
ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma,
the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema
don’t appear in any deity’s formal list. For borderline cases,
you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.
If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your
deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your
connection to your deity. The class features that you lose
are determined by the GM, but they likely include your
holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing
of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you
repent by conducting an atone ritual (Player Core 390).
If your deity doesn’t require the specific sanctification you
had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and
cause (page 89) while still following the same deity.
Sanctification
Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you
holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle
over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither
will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.
If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity’s
sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you “must
be” holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the
deity lists “none,” you can choose only options that don’t
require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy
and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the
previous trait until you atone.
Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely
disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character
option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where

the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy
sanctification and causes are uncommon options.
Holy: You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any
Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not knowingly
harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent
if your direct intervention could save them” and the
anathema “Commit murder.” Even if your game includes
behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline (Player Core 397),
the acts listed there are anathema to you.
Unholy: You gain the unholy trait and add that trait
to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not put
another’s needs before your own or those of your deity”
and the anathema “Commit an entirely altruistic act, such
as giving something away in charity” and “Put anyone’s
needs before those of your deity.” None of these prevents
you from performing acts others might consider helpful,
but these acts must be done with the expectation that they
ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity.
Deific Weapon
You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s an
unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon,
increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8
to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain
access to it, and if it’s an advanced weapon, you treat it as a
martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency.
Champion’s Aura
You’re surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It
has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity
within the aura immediately knows you’re a champion
of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your
champion’s reaction and for various other effects. You can
suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has
the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious.
Cause
You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity’s name.
Some causes are limited to certain sanctifications. Your
cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a
special protective reaction called your champion’s reaction.
The following champion causes are on pages 91–93.
Desecration (Unholy): You selfishly corrupt and destroy.
Grandeur (Holy): You exemplify the glory and splendor
of the celestial realms.
Iniquity (Unholy): You destroy, take advantage, and act
with dishonor.
Justice: You follow laws and mete out just punishment.
Liberation: You oppose tyranny and fight for freedom.
Obedience: You enforce hierarchies and order.
Redemption (Holy): You try to redeem those who
commit wicked deeds.
Devotion Spells
Your deity’s power grants you special divine spells called
devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. Choose
one of the spells appearing on page 256, either shields of
the spirit or a spell based on your deity’s divine font (lay
on hands if your deity allows heal, touch of the void if
your deity allows harm).
It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you
gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of
1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily
preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10
minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or
do service toward their causes.
Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting
attribute is Charisma.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells.
The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is
equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never
be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear
on page 298 of Player Core.
Champion Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a champion class feat. These begin on page 93.
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (Player Core 262),
a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Blessing of the Devoted 3rd
Your deity blesses your service with a boon. This might
come in the form of a spirit that visits you and inhabits
your items or body, a mysterious divine tattoo upon your
body, or the like. Choose one of the following blessings, or
any other to which you have access.
Blessed Armament: Select one weapon or handwraps
of mighty blows. You gain that armament’s critical
specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property
rune of your choice from the following list: fearsome, ghost
touch, returning, shifting, or vitalizing. During your daily
preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different
armament, grant a different rune, or both.
Blessed Shield: In your hands, a shield gains the minor
reinforcing rune. As you go up in level, the shield gains
the reinforcing rune of your level (lesser at 7th level,
moderate at 10th level, greater at 13th level, major at
16th level, and supreme at 19th level). If your shield
already has the appropriate reinforcing rune for your
level, or if it’s a sturdy shield of the same level as the
appropriate reinforcing rune, the shield’s Hardness
instead increases by 1.
Blessed Swiftness: You gain a +5-foot status bonus to
Speed. If you’re mounted, your mount gains the bonus

89

instead. In addition, when the movement of one of your
allies triggers an enemy’s reaction while the ally is in your
champion’s aura, the ally gains a +2 status bonus to all
defenses against that reaction.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in,
or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which
you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Weapon Expertise 5th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies
of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase
to expert.
Armor Expertise 7th
You have spent so much time in armor that you know
how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency
ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for
unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor
specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.
Weapon Specialization 7th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with
the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional
damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in
which you’re an expert. This damage increases to 3
if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.
Champion Expertise 9th
Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your
proficiency ranks for your champion class DC, spell
attack modifier, and spell DC increase to expert.
Reflex Expertise 9th
You’ve developed a knack for dodging danger. Your
proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Relentless Reaction 9th
Your champion’s reaction improves, typically to
punish the attacker with spiritual backlash. It gains
the relentless reaction benefit listed in your cause
below your champion’s reaction.
Sacred Body 9th
The power of your deity keeps your body safe
from harm, as true an edifice of the faith as a
great temple. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
Divine Will 11th
Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

Exalted Reaction 11th
Your champion’s reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing
them to benefit as well. When you use your champion’s
reaction, you also get the effect listed for its exalted reaction.
Perception Expertise 11th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Armor Mastery 13th
Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more
blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy
armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.

You gain the hero’s defiance devotion spell (page 257).
Causes
You have one of the following causes. Some are limited
to sanctification, as noted in parentheses. Your cause adds
to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special
reaction called your champion’s reaction, which appears
after the divider, along with its upgrades if you gain the
relentless reaction and exalted reaction class features at
higher levels.
Edicts and Anathema You gain any edicts or anathema listed.
Champion’s Reaction You gain this reaction to enemy attacks.
Relentless Reaction If you gain the relentless reaction class
feature (typically at 9th level), you add this benefit to your
reaction. Damage dealt by your relentless reaction gains any

(typically at 11th level), when you use your champion’s
reaction you also give a benefit for your allies or detriment
for your enemies.

and you spread a malign influence across all you touch.

the beauty around you, keep yourself tidy and well groomed

You’re dishonorable, dishonest, and committed to
breaking the false hopes of kindness.

## Key Terms

damages, grabs, or restrains your ally, and both are in your
champion’s aura; Effect You free an ally from restraint. If the
trigger was an ally taking damage, the ally gains resistance
to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your
level. The ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing,
restraining, immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either
attempt a new save against one such effect that allows a
save, or attempt to Escape from one effect as a free action.
Whether or not it needed to escape, the ally can then Step as
a free action if it’s able to move.
Relentless Reaction (9th Level) You punish those who ensnare
your allies. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to
make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed
when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent
spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Exalted Reaction (11th Level) In addition to the ally affected by
Liberating Step, you and all other allies in your champion’s aura
can Step as a free action. You and your allies gain the benefit
even if the ally who benefited from Liberating Step can’t move.
Obedience
Society is ordered with good reason, and people should
conduct themselves as appropriate for their proper place.
Edicts enforce proper hierarchies, topple illegitimate hierarchies,
lead when you’re the most suited to the task
Anathema let one who is lesser than you wield power over you
or lead you
Iron Command [reaction] (champion, divine, emotion, mental) Trigger An
enemy in your champion’s aura damages you; Effect You put
an impertinent foe who dared harm you in their proper place.
You command your enemy to kneel before you in obedience.
If they dare to refuse, they must pay the price in pain and
anguish. The enemy must choose one of the following options.
- Kneel The enemy drops prone as a free action.
- Refuse You deal 1d6 mental damage to the enemy. This
damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th level, 4d6
at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.
Regardless of which option the enemy chose, your
Strikes against it deal 1 extra spirit damage until the end
of your next turn. This extra damage increases to 2 at 9th
level and 3 at 16th level.
Relentless Reaction (9th Level) If the enemy refuses, it takes
persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Exalted Reaction (11th Level) Each enemy in your champion’s
aura other than the triggering creature must also either drop
prone or take mental damage (each enemy chooses). These
creatures take only minimum damage (typically 3 damage at
11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at 16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects
they take can’t be adjusted by anything that changes your
Iron Command. For instance, the Iron Repercussions feat
couldn’t turn the damage into persistent mental damage for
creatures other than the triggering creature.
Redemption (Holy)
Yearning for all to live in harmony, you make every attempt
to redeem those others might slay or dismiss.
Edicts try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds, show
compassion to others regardless of their authority or station
Anathema kill a sapient enemy without first offering a chance
at redemption
Glimpse of Redemption [reaction] (champion, divine) Trigger An enemy
damages your ally, and both are in your champion’s aura;
Effect Your enemy hesitates under the weight of sin as visions
of redemption play in their mind’s eye. The enemy must choose
to repent or refuse, with the following effects. If the enemy is
mindless or otherwise unable to repent, use the refuse result.
- Repent The ally is unharmed by the triggering damage.
- Refuse The ally gains resistance to all damage against
the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the
damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes enfeebled 2
until the end of its next turn.
Relentless Reaction (9th Level) If the enemy refuses, it takes
persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Exalted Reaction (11th Level) If the enemy refuses, you can
choose to grant the resistance to yourself and all allies in
your champion’s aura, including the triggering ally. If you do,
the resistance is reduced by 2 for all.
Champion Feats
At each level that you gain a champion feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level


## Brilliant Flash Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites grandeur cause
Your light cleanses souls of fear. When you use Flash of
Grandeur, the attacker is also off-guard for 1 round.
### Defensive Advance [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Champion Flourish

With the protection of your shield, you dive into battle! You
Raise your Shield and Stride. If you end your movement within
melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike
against that enemy. You can use Defensive Advance while
Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if
you have the corresponding movement type.

## Deity’S Domain Feat 1


## Champion

You embody an aspect of your deity. Choose one of your deity’s
domains. (The main deities of Golarion and their domains appear
on pages 35–39 of Player Core.) You gain the domain’s initial
domain spell as a devotion spell.
### Desperate Prayer [free-action] FEAT 1

## Champion

Frequency once per day
Trigger You begin your turn and have no Focus Points.
You call out to your deity in a plea for their aid. You gain 1 Focus

93

Point, which you can spend only to cast a devotion spell. If you
don’t spend this Focus Point by the end of this turn, it is lost.

## Faithful Steed Feat 1


## Champion

You gain the service of a young animal companion as a mount.
See Animal Companions (Player Core 206). If you have the holy
or unholy trait, your mount gains it as well, as do the mount’s
Strikes. Typically, the steed is an animal companion with the
mount ability (such as a horse). The GM might allow another
animal companion option, or allow the creature to have a
different appearance that thematically fits your deity.

## Iron Repercussions Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites obedience cause
Disobeying your Iron Command has lasting consequences. If an
enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal persistent mental
damage instead of normal mental damage. You must decide
whether the mental damage will be persistent before your
enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of damage
is unchanged.

## Nimble Reprisal Feat 1


## Champion

Prerequisites justice cause
You can use Retributive Strike at greater distance. You can use
a ranged weapon to make a ranged Strike instead of a melee
Strike for Retributive Strike. The enemy needs to be in range,
but not in reach, and it must still be in your champion’s aura.
You can also make melee Strikes against enemies a bit farther
away. If the enemy that triggered your reaction is outside your
reach but is within 5 feet of your reach, as part of your reaction
you can Step to put the enemy in your reach before making a
melee Retributive Strike.

## Ongoing Selfishness Feat 1


## Uncommon Champion

Prerequisites desecration cause
Your powerful personality and incredible ego demand that you
protect yourself above all else. After you use Selfish Shield, you
gain resistance to all further damage from the triggering enemy
until the end of the turn on which you used the reaction. This
resistance is equal to half your Selfish Shield resistance.

## Unimpeded Step Feat 1


## Champion

While your vengeance is painful for both you and your foe,
none can doubt that your enemies suffer more. You gain a

Your presence as an avatar of evil makes your foes more
susceptible to terror and makes it almost impossible for

your champion’s aura can’t reduce the value of its frightened
condition below 1.

The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the strength

doesn’t apply to this Strike.

## Shield Warden Feat 6


## Champion

Prerequisites Shield Block
When you have a shield raised, you can use your Shield Block
reaction when an attack is made against an ally adjacent to
you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage
instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the
normal rules for Shield Block.
### Smite [one-action] FEAT 6

## Champion Concentrate

You single out one enemy to destroy in your deity’s name.
Designate one enemy you can see. Until the start of your next
turn, your Strikes against that enemy gain a +3 status bonus
to damage, increasing to +4 if you have master proficiency
with the weapon or unarmed attack you’re using for the
Strike. If you’re holy or unholy and the target has the
opposite trait, the bonus is +4 (or +6 if you’re a master).
If the target takes a hostile action against you or one of
your allies before the start of your next turn, the duration
extends to the end of that enemy’s next turn. If the enemy
continues to take these hostile actions each turn, the duration
continues to extend.

yourself. While the companion shield is in effect, if your shield is

action. If it does, that’s all the actions it gets that round—you
can’t Command it later.
