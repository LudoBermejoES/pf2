During combat encounters...
You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful
finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform
your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift
ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler’s style, you might dance among
your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.
During social encounters...
You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might
be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do
the talking.
While exploring...
You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared
to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment
in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.
In downtime...
You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments,
or train to learn new techniques and stunts. To maintain your impressive
reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a
following of admirers.
You might...
- Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing
you can live up to the image you present.
- Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your
reputation.
- Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow
rusty.
Others probably...
- Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.
- Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your
flamboyant style.
- Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of
your deadly blade.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a swashbuckler. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent
your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.
Panache
You care as much about the way you accomplish something
as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place.
When you perform an action with particular style, you can
leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly
maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.
You gain panache by performing actions that have the
bravado trait. Tumble Through (Player Core 233) and
additional actions determined by your swashbuckler’s style
(see below) gain the bravado trait when you use them. The
GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly
daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding
down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks
typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial
DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat
encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.
Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher
(page 161), can be used only while you have panache and
cause you to lose your panache.
Precise Strike
When you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee
weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2
additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher,
the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.
As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your
additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and
17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a
Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6.
Stylish Combatant
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the
bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have
panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds.
Swashbuckler’s Style
Your own distinctive style lets you gracefully handle
any situation. Choose a swashbuckler’s style. This style
determines the additional actions you use to gain panache
and makes you trained in the skill related to that action.
Battledancer
To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you
command your foes’ attention with mesmerizing motions.
You are trained in Performance and gain the Fascinating
Performance skill feat (Player Core 255). When you
Perform, the action gains the bravado trait.
Braggart
You boast, taunt, and psychologically needle your foes.
You are trained in Intimidation. When you Demoralize, the
action gains the bravado trait.

Fencer
You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to
lead your foes into inopportune attacks. You are trained
in Deception. When you Create a Distraction or Feint, the
action gains the bravado trait.
Gymnast
You reposition, maneuver, and bewilder your foes with
daring feats of physical prowess. You are trained in
Athletics. When you Grapple, Reposition, Shove, or Trip,
the action gains the bravado trait.
Rascal
You aren’t afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the
edge over your opponents. You are trained in Thievery
and gain the Dirty Trick general feat (page 229). When
you use Dirty Trick, the action gains the bravado trait.
Wit
You are friendly, clever, and full of humor, always
knowing just what to say. Your witticisms leave foes
unprepared for the skill and speed of your attacks. You
are trained in Diplomacy and gain the Bon Mot skill feat
(page 228). When you use Bon Mot, the action gains the
bravado trait.
Confident Finisher
You gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when
you have panache. The finisher trait is described on page
163. You gain the Confident Finisher action.
### Confident Finisher [one-action]

## Finisher Swashbuckler

When you Disarm, the action gains the bravado trait.

## Elegant Buckler Feat 1

You’ve learned a flexible way to position your buckler to
provide more protection. When you Raise a Shield to gain a

circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, or a
+2 circumstance bonus if you have a free hand or are wielding

You deftly dodge out of the way, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus

## Flying Blade Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites precise strike
You apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as
melee attacks. You apply your precise strike damage on ranged
Strikes you make with a thrown weapon within that weapon’s
first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or
finesse weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon
ranged Strike for Confident Finisher and any other finisher that
includes a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike.

## Focused Fascination Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Fascinating Performance
When you use Fascinating Performance in a combat encounter,
you need only a success, rather than a critical success, to
fascinate your target. This works only if you’re attempting
to fascinate one target. For example, if you were an expert in

## Key Terms

You’ll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities.
Bravado: Actions with this trait can grant panache,
depending on the result of the check involved. If you
succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain
panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check,
you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn.
These effects can be applied even if the action had no other
effect due to a failure or a creature’s immunity.
Finisher: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that
use your panache. Finishers can be used only with weapons
that deal additional damage with precise strike (agile
or finesse melee weapons or unarmed attacks, for most
swashbucklers). You can use a finisher only if you have
panache, and you lose your panache immediately after
performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can’t use
actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.
Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure.
Effects added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If
your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply
the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this
when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.
Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special
techniques that require too much exertion for you to
perform frequently. You can use only one action with the
flourish trait per round.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action
again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with
the stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round. You
can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can
Dismiss a stance.

163

Performance, you could choose to target multiple creatures
normally or target one creature and fascinate it on a success.

## Goading Feint Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites trained in Deception
Your tricks make foes overextend their attacks. On a Feint, you
can use the following success and critical success effects instead
of any other effects you would gain when you Feint; if you do,
other abilities that adjust the normal effects of your Feint no
longer apply. You can choose whether to use the Goading Feint
benefits or the normal benefits each time you Feint a given foe.
Critical Success The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to
all attack rolls against you before the end of its next turn.
Success The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its next
attack roll against you before the end of its next turn.
### One For All [one-action] FEAT 1
### Auditory Concentrate Emotion Linguistic Mental Swashbuckler
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster
an ally’s efforts. Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action
counts as sufficient preparation to Aid that ally. When you use
the Aid reaction to help that ally, you can roll Diplomacy in place
of the usual check and the action gains the bravado trait.

## Plummeting Roll Feat 1


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
Trigger You fall.
Through nimble movements, a graceful landing, and a bit of
luck, you can manage to fall from spectacular heights without a
scratch. You gain the Cat Fall skill feat and the following reaction.

damage from the fall; Effect You tuck and roll with the motion.

after them next. Attempt an Intimidation check with a +2
circumstance bonus to Demoralize a single creature that you

attack rolls against creatures other than you until the end of
its next turn.
Success The target takes a –1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls
against creatures other then you until the end of its next turn.

agile trait, the penalty is –4 if the action is your second attack
on your turn, or –8 if it’s your third or subsequent attack. If your
weapon or unarmed attack is agile and you have panache, the
penalty is reduced further, to –3 if it’s the second attack on your
turn or –6 if it’s the third or subsequent.

## Combination Finisher Feat 6


## Swashbuckler

You combine a series of attacks with a powerful finishing blow.
Your finishers’ Strikes have a lower multiple attack penalty: –4
(or –3 with an agile weapon) if it’s the second attack on your turn,
or –8 (or –6 with an agile weapon) if it’s the third or subsequent
attack on your turn, instead of –5 and –10, respectively.

another. Choose a creature within 30 feet and Feint against it;
you can attempt this Feint even if the target is not within melee

this applies to your thrown weapon attacks for the duration.
Regardless of the result, you can then Interact to draw a thrown

## Finisher Swashbuckler

## Flashy Roll Feat 8


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Flashy Dodge
You can use Flashy Dodge before attempting a Reflex save, in
addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance bonus
applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.
When you use Flashy Dodge and the triggering attack fails
or critically fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed at
the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part of the

use Flashy Roll while Flying or Swimming instead of Striding if
you have the corresponding movement type.
### Stunning Finisher [one-action] FEAT 8

Through and any skill actions with the bravado trait).

## 12Th Level

### Cheat Death [reaction] FEAT 12

## Swashbuckler

Trigger You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
Somehow you always escape the reaper by a hair’s breadth.
You avoid being knocked out or killed and remain at 1 Hit Point
and gain panache, but you become doomed 1 (or increase your
doomed value by 1 if you were already doomed). You can’t
reduce or ignore the doomed condition from Cheating Death.
The doomed condition from Cheating Death lasts for 10 minutes,
though this doesn’t affect the duration of any other doomed
condition you have.
### Get Used To Disappointment [free-action] FEAT 12

## Bravado Swashbuckler

Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
Requirements Your turn begins, and one target within 30 feet
failed an attack roll or skill check against you on its last turn.
You capitalize on an opponent’s failure with smug attitude
and swagger, reminding them of the gap in skill between you
and your opponent. You attempt to Demoralize the opponent.
Regardless of the result, the target becomes temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
### Mobile Finisher [one-action] FEAT 12

## Finisher Swashbuckler

Finisher while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or

corresponding movement type.
### The Bigger They Are [one-action] FEAT 12

## Bravado Swashbuckler

With reckless speed, you dash, jump and swing around a
creature to find a more vulnerable spot. Attempt to Tumble
Through a creature at least one size category larger than you,
using the following effects.
Critical Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating
the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs
10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to
move all the way through its space, you get the same effect
as a failure. If you successfully pass through the target’s
square, the target gains weakness to your precision damage
equal to half your level, which lasts until the end of your turn.
Success As success, but the weakness applies only against the
next attack you make against the target.
Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you
had moved out of the square you started in.

## 14Th Level

### Flamboyant Leap [two-actions] FEAT 14

## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites master in Athletics, Flamboyant Athlete

## Fencer

You befuddle your foes with deft movements, feints, and
traps, leading them into your cunning counterattacks.
Attributes
Prioritize Dexterity for accuracy, as well as Charisma
for Deception.
Skills
Acrobatics, Deception, Diplomacy, Society, Stealth,
Thievery
Swashbuckler’s Style
Fencer
Starting Feat
Goading Feint
Higher-Level Feats
Tumble Behind (2nd), Reactive Strike (6th), Reflexive
Riposte (10th), Felicitous Riposte (16th)
Sample Swashbuckler

Requirements You are capable of using a finisher.
You stylishly leap and deliver a powerful finisher. Make a
Leap, High Jump, or Long Jump and attempt one single-action
finisher at any point during your jump; the finisher can’t be
one that includes other movement, such as Mobile Finisher.
Immediately after the finisher, you fall to the ground if you’re
in the air, even if you haven’t reached the maximum distance
of your jump. If the distance you fall is no more than the height
of your jump, you take no damage and land upright. When
attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a Flamboyant
Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and increase
the maximum distance to double your Speed, rather than just
your Speed.

## Impossible Riposte Feat 14


## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your ripostes can deflect attacks back at their source. You can
use Opportune Riposte with a trigger of “A foe outside of your
reach critically fails an attack roll against you” in addition to its
usual trigger. When you use Opportune Riposte with this new
trigger against a ranged attack, your Strike deflects some of the
triggering effect back toward its source. Compare the result of
your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On a hit, you deal
the normal amount of damage for your Strike, but the damage
type changes to that of the triggering attack. For instance, if
you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a blazing bolt, your Strike
would deal fire damage instead of its normal damage type.
### Perfect Finisher [one-action] FEAT 14

## Finisher Fortune Swashbuckler

You focus your panache into an impeccable assault. Make a
Strike, rolling the attack roll twice and using the better result.

have the deadly trait, it gains the deadly d8 trait instead.

## Felicitous Riposte Feat 16


## Fortune Swashbuckler

You take advantage of your foe’s openings with uncanny odds.
When you make an Opportune Riposte, roll twice on the attack
roll and take the better result.
### Revitalizing Finisher [one-action] FEAT 16

## Finisher Swashbuckler

Your swagger instills confidence in you and your allies. Make a
Strike. On a hit, you and all allies within 30 feet gain temporary
Hit Points equal to half your level.
Failure You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level.

## 18Th Level


## Incredible Luck Feat 18

Charmed Life, roll the save twice (including the +2 circumstance
bonus from Charmed Life) and use the better result.
### Lethal Finisher [one-action] FEAT 18

## Death Finisher Swashbuckler

Prerequisites precise strike 6d6
You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them outright.
Make a Strike. On a success, you forego your precise strike
damage from the finisher. Instead, your target takes additional

DC. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target’s saving throw
outcome is one degree worse.
Critical Success You deal 6 precision damage.
Success You deal 6d6 precision damage.
Failure You deal 12d6 precision damage.
Critical Failure You deal 18d6 precision damage.
### Parry And Riposte  FEAT 18

## Swashbuckler

Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest
provocation. You can use Opportune Riposte against an enemy
who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically fails),
provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher
on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC
from the parry weapon trait, or Extravagant Parry.

## 20Th Level

### Illimitable Finisher [one-action] FEAT 20

Requirement You are not fatigued.
Your strikes flow endlessly. Step and attempt a single one-action
finisher. This Strike gains the bravado trait, possibly replenishing

attempt another finisher as part of this action, ignoring the
restriction of using actions with the attack trait after a finisher.

## Inexhaustible Countermoves Feat 20


## Swashbuckler

At the start of each enemy’s turn, you gain an extra reaction you
can use only during that turn to perform an Opportune Riposte,
or a Reactive Strike if you have that reaction.

New Familiar Abilities
Item Delivery: If your familiar is adjacent to you, you
can Command it to deliver an item. Instead of its normal
2 actions, your familiar Interacts to take an item you’re
holding of light Bulk or less, then takes one move action,
then finally Interacts to pass off the item to another willing
creature. It can instead administer the item to the creature
if it can do so with 1 action and has an appropriate type
of item (such as alchemical elixir). If your familiar doesn’t
reach the target this turn, it holds the item until commanded
otherwise. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity
ability to select this.
Poison Reservoir: Your familiar has a reservoir for
poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison to an adjacent
ally’s exposed weapon with a single Interact action. You
must supply the poison and instill it into this reservoir
using two consecutive Interact actions. You must have a
homunculus familiar to select this ability.
Second Opinion: Your familiar is your academic
confidant. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains
1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only
to Aid you on a Recall Knowledge skill check for a skill
in which it has the skilled familiar ability (it still has to
prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It
automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those
skills or automatically critically succeeds if you’re a master
of the skill in question. Your familiar must have the skilled
ability to select this.
New Master Abilities
Extra Alchemy: Your familiar helps you brew items at the
start of the day. You can create one additional item with
advanced alchemy during your daily preparations. You
must have the advanced alchemy ability to select this ability.
Extra Vial: Your familiar accretes alchemical liquids in
its body. Once per day, you can Interact when your familiar
is adjacent to you to gain a versatile vial. You must have the
versatile vials ability to select this ability.
Specific Familiars
Some familiars are more powerful than the usual familiars,
and possess unique abilities. Any character can gain a
specific familiar so long as they already have a familiar with
at least the required number of abilities listed in the specific
familiar’s stat block. Such a familiar usually replaces an
existing familiar, though in some circumstances (such as
for a witch) the familiar may evolve or reveal its true form.
In any case, this transition from a normal familiar to a
specific familiar requires no downtime and has no cost.
Once you’ve selected a specific familiar, you can’t change it
This section includes new options for familiar and master abilities, supplementing those
from pages 212–214 of Player Core, as well as stat blocks for familiars with unique abilities.
