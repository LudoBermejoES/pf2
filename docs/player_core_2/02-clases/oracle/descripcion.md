During Combat Encounters...
You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing
miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting
divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your
allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might
wade into battle yourself.
During Social Encounters...
You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage
your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.
While Exploring...
You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing
your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery’s
power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around
you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights.
In Downtime...
You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine
wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the
subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You
could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful
following devoted to your mystery.
You might...
- View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.
- Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great
acts of magic.
- Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.
Others Probably...
- Don’t realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead
believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.
- Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed
by the gods.
- Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform
wondrous acts.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an oracle. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Oracle Spellcasting
You have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of
the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this
power spill forth in the form of divine magic. You are a
spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition
using the Cast a Spell activity. As an oracle, when you cast
spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly
as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your
own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as
religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind.
Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of
spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells
you can cast, as shown on the Oracle Spells per Day table
on page 131.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell
attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.
This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the
spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at
the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that
rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are
heightened to certain ranks (Player Core 297). The signature
spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.
Cantrips
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special
type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a
cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is
automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—
this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot
you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips
are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips
are 3rd-rank spells.
Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells
of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. You
choose these from the common spells on the divine list or
from other divine spells to which you have access. You can
cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot
of an appropriate spell rank.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see the Oracle Spells per Day
table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same
rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd

level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you
add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell
you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of
that spell.
Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire
are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your
spell repertoire, it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and
vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want
to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each
time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap
out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same
rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out
spells by retraining during downtime (Player Core 440).
Mystery
An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine
being. This power could come from a potent concept or
ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of
concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous
conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle’s mystery, a
source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.
Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your
mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus
spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you
a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the
divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse
that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power.
The following oracle mysteries are in this book.
Ancestors (page 135): Voices of past generations teach
and haunt you.
Battle (page 135): You embody the virtues upheld by
heroes of legend.
Bones (page 135): Death always seems near, and the dead
speak to you.
Cosmos (page 136): You draw power from the stars and
the spaces between.
Flames (page 136): You dance with fire and do your best
to remain unscorched by it.
Life (page 137): The teeming energies of life flow through
you out into the world.
Lore (page 137): You gain access to unparalleled,
overwhelming knowledge.
Tempest (page 137): Wind, waves, and storms rage at
your beck and call.
Revelation Spells
The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of
revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of focus spell.
It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your
focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can
regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the
Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your
mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing
how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who
came before you.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots.
Certain feats give you more focus spells.

131

The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold
is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can
never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells
appear in on page 298 of Player Core.
You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a
focus pool of 1 Focus Point. This spell is an initial revelation
spell determined by your mystery. You can learn additional
revelation spells through oracle feats.
Oracular Curse
As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated
divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting
via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special
benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your
mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more
cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens,
but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its
grip on your soul.
Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound
condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles.
Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound
ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a
cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you
increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after
the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only
a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound
condition can’t increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow
in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and
your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4.
Once saturated in divine power, your soul can’t absorb any
more, and so you can’t use a cursebound ability if you are
already at your maximum cursebound condition.
Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being
cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses.
You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces
your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a
Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of
divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or
remove the effects of your curse or any ability
with the cursebound trait by any means other
than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound
effect makes creatures concealed from you, you
can’t negate that concealed condition through a
magic item or spell, such as sure strike (though
you would still benefit from the other effects of
that item or spell). Likewise, cleanse affliction and similar
abilities don’t affect your curse at all.
At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat
determined by your mystery, and you can learn additional
cursebound abilities through oracle feats.
Oracle Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an
oracle class feat.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter,
you gain a skill feat. You must be trained
or better in the corresponding skill to select
a skill feat.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Signature Spells 3rd
Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly.
For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell
of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t
need to learn heightened versions of signature
spells separately; instead, you can heighten

these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at
a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its
lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If
you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with
any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it
(i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). You can also retrain
specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of
that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much
time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase to either become trained
in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an expert in one
skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at
15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill
in which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Expert Spellcaster 7th
The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over
time. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and
spell DCs increase to expert.
Mysterious Resolve 7th
The power of your mystery blazing in your soul makes it
harder for other powers to grip your mind. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Magical Fortitude 9th
Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
Divine Access 11th
Your mystery offers you strange access to spells typically
reserved for more conventional worshippers. Choose one
deity who grants one of your mystery’s granted domains.
Add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that
deity to your spell list, and to your spell repertoire as soon
as you can cast spells of the appropriate rank.
Major Curse 11th
You’ve learned to better tolerate the conflicting powers
wreaking havoc on your body. The maximum cursebound
value you can have increases from cursebound 2 to
cursebound 3.
Oracular Senses 11th
You have always been able to sense a bit more than others.
Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.
Weapon Expertise 11th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of
your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons
and unarmed attacks increase to expert.
Light Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency rank for light armor and
unarmored defense increases to expert.

## Key Terms

You’ll see these key terms in many oracle class features.
Cursebound: Abilities with this trait tighten your
oracular curse’s grasp on your soul in exchange for
divine insights, giving you the cursebound condition
(see below). When you use a cursebound ability, you
become cursebound 1, or if you were already cursebound,
you increase the value of your cursebound condition
by 1. As cursebound abilities are directly linked to your
oracular curse, you can’t use a cursebound ability if you
don’t have an oracular curse or if you are already at your
maximum cursebound value. You can’t mitigate or bypass
the drawbacks of any cursebound ability with spells or
other effects (see Oracular Curse on page 132), and the
effects of any cursebound ability end when you Refocus
and remove the cursebound condition.
Fortune and Misfortune: Fortune and misfortune
effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never
have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect
come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune
effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two
misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse
and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune
effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each
other out, and you roll normally.
Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a
spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
spellshape action itself.

## The Cursebound Condition

Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you
receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply
on your mystery’s powers. Cursebound is a condition
that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and
cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular
curse imposes unique negative effects depending on
your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound
condition only by Refocusing.

133

Premonition’s Reflexes 13th
A chill runs through your spine as danger strikes, giving
you a hair’s more time to dodge or cover yourself. Your
proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Weapon Specialization 13th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and 4
if you’re legendary.
Master Spellcaster 15th
You truly understand the deep and complex divine power
within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for spell
attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.
Extreme Curse 17th
You have mastered a precarious balance between the
conflicting divine powers of your mystery, allowing
you to tolerate a perilous degree of divine curse. The
maximum cursebound value you can have increases from
cursebound 3 to cursebound 4.
Greater Mysterious Resolve 17th
Your time spent in contemplation of the mysteries of
creation has given you a powerful mind and soul. Your
proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary.
When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical
success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will
save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save
against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
Legendary Spellcaster 19th
You can harness divine power at a level few others can
match. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers
and spell DCs increase to legendary.
Oracular Clarity 19th
You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power
behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to
miracles. Add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your
repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can
use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting.
You don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up,
unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-rank slots
with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you
cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the
Oracular Providence feat to gain a second slot.
Mysteries
Choose the divine mystery that fuels your mystical power.
Your mystery might represent a pantheistic devotion to all
the deities with power over the subject of your mystery,
veneration of a particular ideal, or a conduit to raw divine
energy. Whatever its origin and nature, your mystery
determines the revelation spells you can cast and the
oracular curse that overtakes your body. You learn skills
related to that mystery, gain access to a cantrip, and gain a
special benefit drawn from the combined divine knowledge
and experience of your mystery.

Granted Spells You automatically add the spells listed here
to your spell repertoire, as described in Spell Repertoire on
page 130. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-rank spell.
You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the
ability to cast oracle spells of that rank.
Revelation Spells You automatically gain your mystery’s initial
revelation spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting
the Advanced Revelation, Greater Revelation, and Diverse
Mystery oracle feats. These spells start on page 259.
Related Domains These are the cleric domains associated with
your mystery. You gain domain spells, which you can cast as
revelation spells, by taking the Domain Acumen and Domain
Fluency feats. At 11th level, the divine access class feature
also gives you additional slotted spells based on your
domains. The domains and their domain spells appear on
page 372 of Player Core. Domains marked with an asterisk
(*) are found in Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries.
Mystery Skill You become trained in the listed skill. A few
mysteries make you trained in more than one skill.
Oracle Feat You gain this 1st-level oracle feat. This is a
cursebound feat, so using it aggravates your oracular curse.
Ancestors
The voices of generations past speak to you, and you hear
their words. You might resent the constant interruption,
or you might revere the spirits of those who came before.
Perhaps you hail from a culture with strong ancestral
traditions, such as the Shoanti Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan),
a traditional dwarven community that worships Torag’s
family pantheon, or a group that reveres Erastil or Pharasma.
You might commune with powerful psychopomps who
shepherd souls to the afterlife, with the River of Souls itself,
or with those spirits who have become trapped outside of
the great cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their
whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening
your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows
them to meddle in your worldly affairs.
Granted Spells cantrip: guidance; 1st: ill omen; 2nd: ghostly
carrier; 5th: dreaming potential
Revelation Spells initial: ancestral touch; advanced: ancestral
defense; greater: ancestral form
Related Domains death, duty*, family, soul*
Mystery Skill Society
Oracle Feat Whispers of Weakness

## Curse Of Ancestral Meddling


## Curse Divine Oracle Spirit

The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and
meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a wellintentioned
(but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as
punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional
means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a
mixture of the above. When you have the cursebound condition,
you are clumsy with a value equal to your cursebound value as
the spirits of your ancestors temporarily possess you and vie for
control in your mind, hindering your movements.
Battle
Warlike forces fill you with physical might and tactical
knowledge, aiming to have you uphold the glory of
combat, fight to improve the world, prepare against the
necessity of conflict, or endure the inevitability of war.
You might draw upon deities such as Gorum, Iomedae,
Rovagug, the Horseman of War Szuriel, the Queen of the
Night Eiseth, the Vudrani god Diomazul, and others, or
you might find power in the unending conflict between the
armies of Heaven and Hell, the Elemental Planes, the Outer
Gods, or even the collective spirits of those who fought in
wars over the ages.
Granted Spells cantrip: shield; 1st: sure strike; 2nd: telekinetic
maneuver; 4th: weapon storm
Revelation Spells initial: weapon trance; advanced: battlefield
persistence; greater: revel in retribution

### Curse Of The Mortal Warrior

## Curse Divine Oracle

You thrive in the thick of battle, but your mystery’s sheer focus
on the physical and material leaves your soul weak against the
tricks of spellcraft. You smell faintly of steel and blood no matter
how you try to remove or mask the scent, you appear more
imposing and muscular than you actually are, and you hear the
faint clash and clamor of battle in the distance at all times.
Cursebound 1 Spells have an easier time wounding you. You gain
weakness 2 to any damage dealt by a spell. Any immunity or
resistance you have to spells is suppressed. This applies only
to spells, not other magical abilities.
Cursebound 2 You take a –1 status penalty to saving throws
against spells.
Cursebound 3 Your weakness to spells is equal to your level.
Cursebound 4 Your status penalty to saving throws against
spells increases to –2.
Bones
Your mystery imparts an understanding of death and
undeath in all their macabre complexity. You might have
had a brush with death yourself—maybe even dying and
returning to life—or carry the touch of undeath in your
blood. If you commune with deities, you might speak with
guardians of death like Pharasma and the psychopomp
ushers (the most powerful among creatures that guide
souls through the afterlife); a bringer of death like the
Mantis God Achaekek or the Horseman of the Apocalypse
Charon; or a herald of undeath such as Urgathoa.
Granted Spells cantrip: void warp; 1st: grim tendrils; 2nd: false
vitality; 3rd: ghostly weapon
Revelation Spells initial: soul siphon; advanced: armor of bones;
greater: claim undead

## Curse Of Living Death

### Curse Divine Oracle Void Vitality
Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive, and
using your powers furthers this unnatural living death, making
you susceptible to both void and vitality damage. You carry a
touch of the grave about you, manifesting as bloodless pallor, a
faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.
Cursebound 1 You gain weakness 2 to vitality and void damage.
You can be hurt by both vitality and void damage even if one
or the other normally has no effect on you. Any immunity or
resistance you have to vitality or void is suppressed.
Cursebound 2 You take a –1 status penalty to Fortitude saves.
Cursebound 3 Your weakness to vitality and void damage is
equal to 5 + your level.
Cursebound 4 Your status penalty to Fortitude saving throws
increases to –2.
Cosmos
Celestial bodies great and small exert influence on you,
giving you sublime cosmic power. Perhaps you see the
glittering stars as a divine blessing, or perhaps you feel
drawn to the infinitely dark spaces between. You might
uphold deities like Desna, Sarenrae, or the deific lovers
Shizuru and Tsukiyo who represent the sun and the moon—
or you might draw power from dark entities from beyond
the stars, like certain Outer Gods, or destructive gods of the
night like Zon-Kuthon or the rat goddess Lao Shu Po.
Granted Spells cantrip: light; 1st: dizzying colors; 2nd: darkness;

CURSE OF THE SKY’S CALL

## Curse Divine Oracle

Your body is drawn toward the heavens, making you lighter and
less substantial than you should be. Your eyes glow with starry
light, and your hair and clothing float and drift around you.
When you have the cursebound condition, you are enfeebled
with a value equal to your cursebound value, and you take a
status penalty to saves and DCs against all forms of forced
movement equal to your cursebound value.
Flames
Fire lives at the center of the world, the center of the
sun, and the center of civilization. You might revere this
elemental force, siphon power from the Elemental Plane of
Fire, or venerate a collection of deities such as Asmodeus,
Sarenrae, the Tian goddess of disasters and volcanoes Lady
Nanbyo, or the elemental lord of fire Ymeri.
Granted Spells cantrip: ignition; 1st: breathe fire; 2nd: blazing
bolt; 3rd: fireball

## Curse Of Engulfing Flames


## Curse Divine Fire Oracle

Fires flare noticeably (though not dangerously) in your
presence, you occasionally smoke slightly, and your body
is almost painfully hot to the touch. When you have the
cursebound condition, you catch fire, taking persistent fire
damage equal to your cursebound value. The flames shed
light like a torch, and if you enter an environment where they
could not burn (such as underwater), you simply seethe with
flameless heat. The flames subside when you begin Refocusing
to assuage your curse or if you fall unconscious, but they
resume if your Refocus activity is interrupted or when you
return to consciousness.
Life
The never-ending flow of life force within living beings is
palpable to you. You might uphold the sanctity of life, or
perhaps you seek to undermine it. You might draw power
from the collective vitality of the world’s living creatures,
hold some connection to Creation’s Forge, or revere a
collection of deities including Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae,
and the god of medicine Qi Zhong.

## Curse Of Outpouring Life


## Curse Divine Oracle

Life energy flows outward from you and connects you to all
living things, but you expend your vital essence to do so. Your
presence comforts the ill and injured, causes scars to fade
slightly, spurs new growth in plants, and otherwise infuses your
surroundings with vitality. As your life force seeps outward, it
becomes more difficult to keep your body functioning. Magical
effects that restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal
to your level (minimum 1) times your cursebound value to the
number of HP you recover.
Lore
Knowledge and information come freely to you. You
might use this lore to gain power or perhaps to understand
the divine mysteries of the multiverse. You might have a
conduit to the fabled Akashic Record, maintain a subtle
telepathic connection to the collective subconscious of
all living creatures, or follow in the footsteps of deities
such as Abadar, Irori, Nethys, Irori’s scholarly nephew
Gruhastha, the fey triune goddess of fate Magdh, or the
aeon god figure known as the Monad.
Revelation Spells initial: brain drain; advanced: access lore;

Related Domains knowledge, magic, secrecy, truth
Mystery Skill Occultism and one Lore skill of your choice
Oracle Feat Whispers of Weakness

## Curse Of Torrential Knowledge


## Curse Divine Oracle

You have a link to true divine knowledge, but your mortal mind
struggles to process and act on what you know. Loose materials
around you, such as dust, grains of rice, and droplets of water,
slowly shift to form strange runes or faint, indecipherable writing,
and you sometimes speak unintelligible truths or statements in
unknown languages without realizing it. You take a status penalty
to Perception checks and Will saving throws equal to your
cursebound value due to the torrential distractions of unaskedfor
knowledge flooding your mind. If you are cursebound 4,
you additionally can’t speak, use linguistic effects, or otherwise
communicate with your allies, and you are stupefied 1.
Tempest
The fury of the wind and waves pounds in your heart, whether
your power flows from natural storms, a conduit to the elemental
Planes of Air and Water, or through reverence of deities such
as Gozreh, the tengu god of storms Hei Feng, the pirate queen
Besmara, or the elemental lords of air and water.

## Curse Of Inclement Headwinds


## Curse Divine Oracle

The weather seems to always oppose you in ways large and
small. Even when you are calm and at rest, your hair and
clothing are inconveniently blown about by gentle winds,
you are slightly damp from the faintest drizzle, and your
touch often comes with a static shock. When you have the
cursebound condition, you are opposed by the elements, with
the following effects.
Cursebound 1 Lightning is drawn to you. You gain electricity
weakness 2 and electricity spells or effects that have
additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal
treat you as though you were wearing metal. Any immunity or
resistance you have to such spells and effects is suppressed.
Cursebound 2 Blowing winds impose a -2 circumstance penalty
to ranged attack rolls you make.
Cursebound 3 Your weakness to electricity is equal to 5 +
your level.
Cursebound 4 The raging winds push you back, imposing a -10-
foot status penalty to all your Speeds.

Oracle Feats
At every level that you gain an oracle feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level

### Foretell Harm [free-action] FEAT 1

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Frequency once per round
Requirements Your previous action was to Cast a non-cantrip
Spell that dealt damage.
Your magic echoes ominously as you glimpse injury in the target’s
future. At the beginning of your target’s next turn, it takes damage
equal to twice the triggering spell’s rank as a seemingly random
and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune
is of a type matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire
damage, a flame might spontaneous ignite on them or they might
burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily immune
to Foretell Harm for 24 hours.
### Glean Lore [one-action] FEAT 1

## Divine Oracle Secret

You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety
of potentially useful information. Attempt a Religion check
to understand the information you gain. The GM sets the DC
(similar to the DC to Recall Knowledge), potentially adjusting
the DC of the check for topics far removed from your mystery.
Critical Success You comprehend the lore accurately or gain a
useful clue from the divine about your situation.
Success You learn two pieces of information about the topic, one
true and one erroneous, but you don’t know which is which.
Failure You recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or
misleading clue.
Critical Failure You recall two pieces of incorrect information or
gain two erroneous or misleading clues.
### Nudge The Scales [one-action] FEAT 1
### Cursebound Divine Healing Oracle Spirit
You lay a finger on the scales of life and death to heal a creature,
regardless of whether it’s living or undead. You restore Hit Points
equal to 2 + double your level to one creature within 30 feet.
In addition, you can mediate during your daily preparations
to place yourself on one side of the scales. Choose life or death.
If you align yourself with life, you are healed by vitality healing
effects, as normal for most living creatures; if you align yourself
with death, you gain the void healing ability, causing you to be
healed by void effects that restore Hit Points and any other
effects that restore Hit Points to undead creatures.
### Oracular Warning [free-action] FEAT 1
### Auditory Cursebound Divine Emotion Mental Oracle
Trigger You are about to roll initiative.
You have a premonition about impending danger that you use
to warn your allies. Each ally within 20 feet gains a +2 status
bonus to their initiative roll and gains temporary Hit Points equal
to half your level, which last for 1 minute. If you are cursebound
2 when you use Oracular Warning, the bonus increases to +3,
and if you are cursebound 3, the bonus increases to +4.
### Reach Spell [one-action] FEAT 1

## Concentrate Oracle Spellshape

You can extend your spells’ ranges. If the next action you use
is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range by
30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell
normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
### Whispers Of Weakness [one-action] FEAT 1

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Voices whisper to you how to best lay a creature low. You target
one creature within 60 feet; if it has any weaknesses, you learn
them, as well as which of its saving throw modifiers is lowest.
You also come to understand its movements, gaining a +2 status
bonus to your next attack roll (or skill check made as part of an
attack action) against that foe before the end of your turn. The
target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
### Widen Spell [one-action] FEAT 1

## Manipulate Oracle Spellshape

You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a
wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn’t have a duration,
increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a
burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with
a smaller radius isn’t affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone
or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to
the length of a larger cone or line.

## 2Nd Level


## Cantrip Expansion Feat 2


## Oracle

Study broadens your range of simple spells. Add two additional
cantrips from your spell list to your repertoire.
### Divine Aegis [reaction] FEAT 2

## Divine Oracle

Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but
you haven’t rolled yet.
A barrier offers protection against other magic but leaves you
exposed to divine energy. Until the beginning of your next turn,
you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against nondivine
magical effects, but you also take a –1 circumstance penalty
to saves against divine effects.

## Domain Acumen Feat 2


## Oracle

Every oracle’s mystery touches on a divine domain of the
deities that fuel it; you can access that power. Choose one of
the domains associated with your mystery for which you don’t
already have an initial domain spell. You gain an initial domain
spell from that domain, which you cast as a revelation spell.

Special You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a
different domain each time and gaining its domain spell as a
revelation spell.
### Meddling Futures [free-action] FEAT 2

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

You open yourself to the guidance of whatever spirits or powers
deign to help you. Roll 1d4 to see what type of spirit is drawn
to you. Your next action must be the type of action the spirit
prefers, but you also gain the listed benefit for the action as the
spirit guides you. If you attempt to use a different action, you
must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or the action is lost.
1 Warrior You must attempt a Strike. You gain a +1 status bonus
to your attack roll and a +2 status bonus to damage, or a +6
status bonus to damage if you are at least cursebound 3.
2 Adept You must attempt a Perception check or a skill action.
You gain a +1 status bonus to the check, or a +2 status bonus
if you are cursebound 3.
3 Sage You must attempt to Cast a Spell. You gain a status
bonus to the spell’s damage or healing equal to the spell’s
rank, or equal to the spell’s rank + 3 if you are at least
cursebound 3.
4 Wanderer You must attempt a Stride action, or a Fly, Climb, or
Burrow action if you have the relevant speed. You gain a +10-
foot status bonus to your Speed for the action, or a +20-foot
status bonus if you are at least cursebound 3.

## 4Th Level

### Bespell Strikes [free-action] FEAT 4

## Oracle

Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a noncantrip
spell.
You siphon spell energy into one weapon you’re wielding, or
into one of your unarmed attacks, such as a fist. Until the end
of your turn, the weapon or unarmed attack deals an extra
1d6 force damage and gains the divine trait if it didn’t have it
already. If the spell dealt a different type of damage, the Strike
deals this type of damage instead (or one type of your choice
if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).
### Knowledge Of Shapes [free-action] FEAT 4

## Cursebound Oracle Spellshape

Prerequisites Reach Spell or Widen Spell
Inspiration lets you surpass your preconceptions of your spells’
limits. You use Reach Spell or Widen Spell as a free action.
### Thousand Visions [free-action] FEAT 4

## Cursebound Oracle Prediction

You open your senses to numerous visions of the immediate
future. The visions grant you subtle details of your immediate
surroundings within 30 feet. Within this range, you don’t need

139

to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed creature, you’re
not off-guard to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you’re
off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition),
and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden
creature. Beyond 30 feet, the visions become overwhelmed with
too many possible futures, making all of your senses imprecise
beyond this range. The visions persist for 1 minute.

## 6Th Level


## Advanced Revelation Feat 6


## Oracle

Prerequisites initial revelation spell
Divine power reveals greater mysteries to you. You learn the
advanced revelation spell associated with your mystery.

## Gifted Power Feat 6


## Oracle

Your mystery grants you additional magic. You have an extra
spell slot of your highest rank, which you can use only to cast one
of your mystery’s granted spells, heightened to this rank.
Special If you have the divine access class feature or Mysterious
Repertoire feat, you can cast spells that you learned from those
abilities using the additional spell slot from Gifted Power.

## Spiritual Sense Feat 6


## Divine Oracle

You have a vague connection to the Ethereal Plane that enables
you to notice spirits. While you’re exploring but not Searching,
the GM rolls a secret check for you to find haunts that usually
require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on the Ethereal
Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual essence such as
celestials, fiends, and monitors.
You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits
inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet of you. This
applies while Searching, while Seeking, and on the automatic
secret check you gain while exploring even if you aren’t Searching.
You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you
can’t see them if they’re more than 5 feet inside an object. When
you notice a creature with this sense, you also learn its location,
making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.

## Steady Spellcasting Feat 6


## Oracle

Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your
concentration when you Cast a Spell. If another creature’s
reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC
15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.

## 8Th Level

### Debilitating Dichotomy [two-actions] FEAT 8
### Concentrate Cursebound Divine Mental Oracle
You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the
divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon with
another’s conflicts as well. You and one creature within 30 feet

## Lifebringer

You focus on supportive magic, channel divine power into
healing energy for your allies to keep them standing.
Attribute Scores
Focus on Charisma to boost your magic, and Wisdom and
Intelligence to help understand and treat the ailments
your magic can’t heal.

each take 9d6 mental damage with a basic Will save, and the
target is stunned 1 if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of
success one better than you rolled for your saving throw. At 10th
level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 3d6.

## Read Disaster Feat 8


## Exploration Oracle Prediction

You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries
of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the
future. You gain the effects of augury, except you learn only
about the dangers ahead; any results of “good” are instead
“nothing,” and results of “mixed” are instead “bad.” If you are
legendary in Religion, you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
### Surging Might [one-action] FEAT 8

## Manipulate Oracle Spellshape

You focus the power of your spell to overcome enemies’
resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell
ignores an amount of the target’s resistance equal to your level
against the following types of damage: spirit, vitality, and void.
This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent
damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell. This
doesn’t cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.

## Water Walker Feat 8


## Oracle

When in the throes of your curse, your steps take on a
supernatural buoyancy. When you are cursebound 1, you can
Stride across liquids that don’t support your weight, but you
must end your movement on a surface that can support you or
you fall into the liquid as normal. When you are cursebound 2
or worse, you gain the effects of water walk.

## 10Th Level

### Quickened Casting [free-action] FEAT 10

## Concentrate Oracle Spellshape

Frequency once per day
If your next action is to cast an oracle cantrip or an oracle spell that
is at least 2 ranks lower than your highest-rank oracle spell slot,
reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
### Roll The Bones Of Fate [one-action] FEAT 10

## Cursebound Divine Oracle Prediction

Prerequisites bones or lore mystery
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You roll a handful of bones to learn (or perhaps influence) the
future course of events. Roll 1d4 and use the corresponding
result below. Whenever you Roll the Bones of Fate, any effects
from a previous usage immediately end.
1 Good You or an ally within 30 feet can roll twice on your
next attack roll or skill check, taking the higher result. This
is a fortune effect.
2 Bad One creature you are observing within 30 feet must
succeed at a Will save against your spellcasting DC; on a
failure, the target must roll twice on their next attack roll or
skill check that takes at least one action to perform, taking
the lower result. This is a misfortune effect.
3 Mixed You gain the benefits of rolling both a 1 and a 2.
4 Cursed Possibilities Your attempts to meddle in the forces
of prophecy bring dire consequences for all. Every creature
within 30 feet of you when you perform the augury rolls twice
on their next attack roll or skill check that takes at least one
action to perform; if the highest number rolled is odd, they take
the lower result, and if the highest number rolled is even, they
take the higher result. If they took the lower result, this effect
has the misfortune trait for them, and if they took the higher
result, it has the fortune trait.
### The Dead Walk [two-actions] FEAT 10

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Prerequisites ancestors or battle mystery
You beseech warrior spirits to come forth and aid you. Two
ghostly warriors manifest within a 30-foot emanation of you
and each attempt a Strike against an adjacent enemy, using your
spell attack modifier, and then disappear. The warriors’ Strikes
each deal 4d6 spirit damage and the warriors can flank with one
another and with you and your allies. If you are cursebound 2
when you use The Dead Walk, you instead summon three
warriors, and if you are cursebound 3, you instead summon four
warriors. The warriors disappear at the start of your next turn.
### Trial By Skyfire [one-action] FEAT 10

## Cursebound Divine Fire Oracle

Prerequisites cosmos or flames mystery
Your lips murmur as you portend a great disaster, one you
hope you survive. A rain of blazing bolts begins to fall from the
heavens in a 10-foot emanation, centered on you, that deals 2d6
fire damage to all creatures in the emanation at the end of each
of your turns (basic Reflex save); you can’t exclude yourself from
the emanation. The skyfire persists for 1 minute; while you can’t
Dismiss it, you can suppress the effect for 1 round with a Sustain
action. The rain of fire is suppressed if you fall unconscious. If
you become cursebound 3 or 4 at any point during Trial by
Skyfire’s duration, the emanation increases to 15 feet and the
damage increases to 4d6.
### Waters Of Creation [two-actions] FEAT 10
### Cursebound Divine Healing Oracle Vitality Water
Prerequisites life or tempest mystery
Water is the source of life, and you draw upon this primordial
force to heal your allies’ wounds. A gentle ring ripples out from
you in a 15-foot emanation, restoring 5d6 Hit Points to creatures
in the area. At 12th level and every two levels thereafter, the
amount restored increases by 1d6. If you are cursebound 3 when
you use Waters of Creation, the amount healed increases to d8s.

## 12Th Level


## Domain Fluency Feat 12


## Oracle

Prerequisites Domain Acumen

141

You command a deep understanding of the domains related to
your mystery. Choose one of the domains associated with your
mystery for which you have an initial domain spell. You gain an
advanced domain spell from that domain, which you cast as a
revelation spell.
### Epiphany At The Crossroads [free-action] FEAT 12

## Divine Oracle

Frequency once per day
Trigger Your turn begins.
Requirements You are unconscious and have the dying condition.
The crossroads between life and death is a place that can reveal
many secrets. You gain the effects of an augury spell in a strange,
near-death vision. Empowered by the realization, you then lose
the dying condition (becoming wounded 1 or increasing your
wounded value by 1, as normal), regain a number of Hit Points
equal to twice your level, and can Stand.

## Greater Revelation Feat 12


## Oracle

Prerequisites initial revelation spell
You unlock deeper revelations hidden within your mystery. You
gain your mystery’s greater revelation spell.

## Magic Sense Feat 12


## Detection Divine Oracle

You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.
You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were
always using a 1st-rank detect magic spell. This detects magic in
your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of
a 3rd-rank detect magic spell on things you observe (in addition
to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off
and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

## 14Th Level

### Forestall Curse [free-action] FEAT 14

## Divine Oracle

Prerequisites Water Walker
Your mysterious steps become even lighter, transcending
the mortal world altogether. When you have the cursebound
condition, you gain the effects of fly. If you are cursebound 3
or greater, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed.

## Mysterious Repertoire Feat 14


## Oracle

Your mystery holds unknowable depths of magic not always
associated with the divine. You can have one spell in your spell
repertoire not on the divine spell list, in addition to spells you’ve
added to your spell list from abilities like divine access. You cast

## Guided Blade

Your mystery guides your weapons in the trance of
battle. You use your magic primarily to empower
yourself, rather than targeting your enemies, so that
your Strikes hit home.
Attribute Scores
Since you’ll be using your spells on yourself more
than your enemies, aim for a broader balance of
Charisma with Strength or Dexterity, as suits your
chosen weapon. Higher Constitution will improve your
survivability in battle.

that spell as a divine spell. You can swap which spell you add
and from which tradition as you could any other oracle spell, but
you can’t use this feat to have more than one spell from another
tradition in your spell repertoire at the same time.

## Revelation’S Focus Feat 14


## Oracle

The further extents of your mystery provide an endless
wellspring of magic. When you Refocus, you regain all your
Focus Points instead of 1.

## 16Th Level

### Conduit Of Void And Vitality [two-actions] FEAT 16

## Cursebound Divine Oracle

Prerequisites any oracle mystery
Requirements You have heal or harm as a signature spell and
an available spell slot to cast it with.
You use the unstable energy of your curse to manipulate the
most basic of divine magic. You cast a 3-action heal or harm spell,
expending the slot as normal. If the spell restores Hit Points to
one or more creatures, then one creature healed by this spell
regains a number of additional Hit Points equal to 1d8 × your
cursebound value; if the spell damages one or more creatures,
then one creature harmed by this spell takes additional damage
equal to 1d8 × your cursebound value.

## Diverse Mystery Feat 16


## Oracle

Prerequisites Advanced Revelation
You have broadened your understanding of the divine and can
tap into the wonders of a different mystery. Select one revelation
spell from a mystery other than your own. You can choose only
an initial revelation spell or an advanced revelation spell.
This spell gains the cursebound trait for you, and when you
cast it, you gain the cursebound 1 effects of its mystery in
addition to your normal curse effects. Any ability that lets you
use a cursebound ability without increasing the severity of your
curse also prevents you from gaining this additional curse effect.
You can’t cast your chosen revelation spell if any of the
following conditions are true: its mystery’s curse effects directly
conflict with or negate the effects of your own mystery’s curse,
the curse would have no effect on you (for example, removing
an ability from your original mystery that you lack), or if either
of these criteria would be met once you finish Casting the Spell.
### Portentous Spell [one-action] FEAT 16
### Manipulate Mental Oracle Spellshape Visual
Your spellcasting is rife with strange lights, mild fumes, and
other captivating effects that befuddle your foes. If the next
action you use is to Cast a Spell, any creature that attempts to
use a reaction triggered by your Cast a Spell activity takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks rolled as
part of the reaction. In addition, if the spell includes a spell attack
or requires a saving throw, creatures you hit or that fail their
saves are fascinated with you until the start of your next turn.

## 18Th Level

### Blaze Of Revelation [free-action] FEAT 18

## Oracle

Requirements You are cursebound 4.
Your mind and body can, for a short time and with great peril,
surpass the final limits of your curse. For 1 minute, you shed
torrential flames, become surrounded by spirits, or otherwise
overflow with divine power in a way that suits your mystery. On
each of your turns during that time, you can cast one revelation
spell without spending Focus Points.
At the end of the minute, the durations of any revelation
spells you cast during that time end, and you must attempt a
DC 40 Fortitude save.
Critical Success You aren’t otherwise affected.
Success You are drained 2 and can’t reduce or remove this
condition until your next preparations.
Failure You are drained 4 and can’t reduce or remove this
condition until your next preparations.
Critical Failure You die.

## Divine Effusion Feat 18


## Oracle

The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of
divine energy, even when your own magic dwindles. Twice per
day, you can cast a spell after you’ve run out of spell slots of
the appropriate spell rank; the two spells you cast with this feat
must be of different spell ranks.

## 20Th Level

### Mystery Conduit [free-action] FEAT 20

## Cursebound Oracle Spellshape

The power of your mystery enables you access to myriad magic.
If your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th rank or lower that has
no duration, you do not expend a spell slot.

## Oracular Providence Feat 20


## Oracle

Prerequisites oracular clarity
Your mystery grants you access to deep reserves of truly
miraculous divine power. You gain an additional 10th-rank
spell slot.

## Paradoxical Mystery Feat 20


## Oracle

Prerequisites Greater Revelation
The truest depths of your divine mystery are fathomless
and contradictory, granting you changing powers that even
you can barely begin to fathom. Each day during your daily
preparations, choose one basic or advanced domain spell
from any domain from Player Core, one of the domains
granted by your mystery, another domain to which you
have access, or any initial or advanced revelation spell from
another mystery. You gain that spell as a revelation spell
until your next daily preparations.

You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There’s magic
in your blood. Perhaps a divine influence blessed one of your ancestors, a
forebear communed with an ancient, primordial entity, or a powerful occult
ritual performed long ago influenced your lineage. Self-reflection and study
allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities.
The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of
whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.
