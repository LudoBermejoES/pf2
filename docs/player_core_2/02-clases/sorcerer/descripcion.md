During combat encounters...
You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper
their movements. You might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee
combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your
own in a brawl. While your magic is strong, you also rely on cantrips in
order to conserve your more powerful spells for the right moment (or after
you’ve used such spells up).
During social encounters...
Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.
While exploring...
You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your party of
magical traps. When your group encounters mysteries or problems related to
your bloodline, you try to solve them.
In downtime...
You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to
research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.
You might...
- Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject
your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a
spellcaster and as an individual.
- View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—
anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.
- Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your
limited selection of spells.
Others probably...
- Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your
abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.
- Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics,
and other disciplined practitioners of magic, since power comes to you
naturally.
- Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if
your personality proves otherwise.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a sorcerer. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you
have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Bloodline
Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.
This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the
spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you
learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus
Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The
bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.
Aberrant: A strange and unknowable influence gives
you occult spells.
Angelic: Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.
Demonic: A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.
Diabolic: A bond with devils gives you divine spells.
Draconic: The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.
Elemental: The power of the elements manifests in you
as primal spells.
Fey: Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.
Hag: The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.
Imperial: An ancient power grants you arcane spells.
Undead: The touch of death gives you divine spells.
See Bloodlines on page 149 for more information.
Sorcerer Spellcasting
Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical
power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the
Cast a Spell activity (Player Core 299). The tradition from
which your spells come is determined by your bloodline.
As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the
gestures and incantations you use to shape your power
might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a
sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural
fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.
Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of
spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells
you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table
on page 147.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell
attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403
of Player Core.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells.
This increases the spell’s rank, heightening it to match the
spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at
the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that
rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they
are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class
feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.

Cantrips
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type
of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip
at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always
automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—
this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell
slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your
cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer,
your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.
Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of
your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as
an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (page
149). You choose these from the common spells from the
tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other
spells from that tradition to which you have access. You
can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell
slot of an appropriate spell rank.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per
Day table above), you add a spell to your spell repertoire
of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your
first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that
rank that’s listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the
other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell;
at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and
two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells,
you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already
know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it
wouldn’t give you another spell slot or vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you
might want to replace some of the spells you previously
learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells,
you can swap out one of your old spells for a different
spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but
you can’t swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap
out spells by retraining during downtime (Player Core
440).
Sorcerous Potency
Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your
spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other
spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots
that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain
a status bonus to that spell’s damage or healing equal to
the spell’s rank. This applies only to the initial damage or
healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature
takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once
per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that
creature multiple times.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat (Player Core 249). You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

Sorcerer Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a sorcerer class feat. These begin on page 152.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general
feat (Player Core 249).
Signature Spells 3rd
Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells
more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose
one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need
to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately;
instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned
a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell
rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also
retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different
spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as
much time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in
one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency
rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at
15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill
in which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Magical Fortitude 5th
Magical power has improved your body’s
resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves
increases to expert.
Expert Spellcaster 7th
Your inherent magic responds easily and
powerfully to your command. Your proficiency
ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs
increase to expert.
Reflex Expertise 9th
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency
rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Perception Expertise 11th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your
proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.
Weapon Expertise 11th
You’ve improved your combat skill. Your
proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed
attacks increase to expert.
Defensive Robes 13th
The flow of magic and your defensive training
combine to help you avoid attacks. Your
proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases
to expert.
Weapon Specialization 13th
You’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with
your most practiced weapons. You deal
2 additional damage with weapons and
unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.
This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master,
and 4 if you’re legendary.

Master Spellcaster 15th
You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood.
Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell
DCs increase to master.
Majestic Will 17th
Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of
magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves
increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will
save, you get a critical success instead.
Bloodline Paragon 19th
You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add
two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your
repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can
use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike
other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as
you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let
you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities
that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline
Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.
Legendary Spellcaster 19th
You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your
proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs
increase to legendary.
Bloodlines
Your bloodline determines your spell list, the tradition of
spells you cast, and grants you access to two trained skills.
Bloodline Spells
Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells
unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus
spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you
start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your
focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can
regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the
Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don’t need
to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing
through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.
These spells can be found starting on page 262.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots; you can’t cast them using spell slots.
The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is
equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can
never be more than 3 points. The full rules are on page
298 of Player Core.
You learn the initial bloodline spell, which is unique to
your bloodline.
Reading a Bloodline Entry
A bloodline entry contains the following information.
Tradition You use this magical tradition and spell list; Bloodline
Skills You become trained in the listed skills.
Sorcerous Gifts You automatically add the spells listed here
to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire
feature listed on page 147. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and
a 1st-rank spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon
as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that rank.
Bloodline Spells You automatically gain the initial bloodline
spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the
Advanced Bloodline (page 154) and Greater Bloodline (page
154) feats.
Blood Magic Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using a
Focus Point or a sorcerous gift spell using a spell slot, you
choose one blood magic effect you know to benefit from.
You begin play with the benefit listed in your bloodline and
can gain others through sorcerer feats.
If the blood magic effect offers a choice, make it before
resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after
resolving any checks for the spell’s initial effects and, against
a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the
foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must
designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the
spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references
to spell rank refer to the rank of the spell you cast.
Aberrant
Something ancient and unknowable speaks to you from
beyond the stars or below the earth.

Sorcerous Gifts cantrip: daze; 1st: phantom pain; 2nd: stupefy;

Blood Magic—Eerie Veil An ominous pall spills from your mind.
Either one target takes a –1 status penalty to Will saving
throws for 1 round or you gain a +2 status bonus to Will
saving throws for 1 round.

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities.
Blood Magic: Casting a sorcerous gift spell granted by
your bloodline or a bloodline spell allows you to benefit
from a blood magic effect you know. You can typically only
benefit from one blood magic effect at a time, though some
feats and abilities may change this.
Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a
spellshape action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
spellshape action itself.

select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.

## 1St Level

## Sorcerer

Trigger A creature targets you with a spell of the same tradition
as your bloodline.
The magic in your blood surges in response to your foe’s spell. You
generate a blood magic effect you know, even if you are already
under the effects of blood magic. The target must be either you
or the creature that triggered Blood Rising. If the blood magic
effect grants you a bonus to AC or the appropriate saving throw,

a duration, it instead lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

of your bloodline.

## Concentrate Sorcerer Spellshape

You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you

to 30 feet.
### Tap Into Blood [one-action] FEAT 1

Requirements You are benefiting from a blood magic effect
The power in your blood allows you to perform minor feats of
magic. You can perform one of the following actions depending
on the tradition of your bloodline.
- Arcane Your mind temporarily opens to the secrets of the
world. Attempt to Recall Knowledge; you can use Arcana
instead of the skill normally needed for that subject. If
you critically fail at this check, you get a failure instead.
- Divine Whatever divine provenance is in your lineage
guides you to instinctively move yourself or others out
of harm’s way. You Step, or you Reposition a target within
your reach using Religion for the check.

that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a

you or an ally would gain a blood magic effect, you can forgo it,

target of your spell. You can anoint only one ally at a time; if you
place another rune, your previous designation ends.

Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip
spell that granted you a blood magic effect.

of spells. During your daily preparations, you can choose one
spell in your spell repertoire to be a signature spell that day. You
can use the Learn a Spell activity to add more arcane spells to the
list you choose from, but if you prepare a spell that isn’t in your
repertoire, you temporarily add it to your repertoire at the spell
rank of your choice instead of making it a signature spell.

## Sorcerer

Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a noncantrip
spell.

of your turn, the weapon or unarmed attack deals an extra 1d6
force damage and gains the trait of your bloodline’s magical

types of damage).

## Concentrate Sorcerer Spellshape

You fragment a ranged spell. If your next action is to Cast a Spell
without a duration that requires an attack roll against a single
target, you can choose a second target within range. You roll a
single attack roll and compare the result to the AC of both targets.

range.

from your space instead of their own.

## Steady Spellcasting Feat 6


## Sorcerer

You are confident in your spellcasting technique, and you are
more easily able to retain your concentration when you Cast a
Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt
a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.

Blood Magic—Explosion of Power Raw power explodes outward
from you. Each creature within a 5-foot emanation takes

save). The type of damage depends on the tradition of your
bloodline. If you cast arcane spells, you deal force damage.
If you cast divine spells, you deal spirit damage. If you cast
occult spells, you deal mental damage. If you cast primal
spells, you deal fire damage.

### Energy Fusion [one-action] FEAT 10

## Concentrate Sorcerer Spellshape

You fuse two spells together, combining their energy types. If the
next action you use is to Cast a Spell that deals energy damage,

different type of energy damage, and expend an additional spell
slot of the same rank as this secondary spell. The spell you cast

slot expended. The spell’s total damage is divided evenly between
the energy type of the spell you cast and the energy type of the
secondary spell.

You wield blood magic masterfully. When you would benefit
from a blood magic effect, you can choose to lose Hit Points

Plane, though this doesn’t grant you the ability to locate them.

## Magic Sense Feat 12

benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a
free action at the start or the end of your turn.

your bloodline.

Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons. For
you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart
among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of
the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes
that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and
cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.
