During combat encounters...
You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of
your party with potent elixirs. You might even use mutagens to warp your
body into a resilient and powerful weapon.
During social encounters...
You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related
secrets, such as poisons and diseases.
While exploring...
You keep an eye out for additional ingredients that you can turn into
alchemical reagents, while giving advice on all things alchemical and
mysterious.
In downtime...
You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and
furthering your alchemical knowledge.
You might...
- Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often
with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.
- Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions
you’ve made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
- Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.
Others probably...
- Think you’re some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don’t
understand that you don’t cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble
in alchemy only heighten this misconception.
- Don’t understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
- Assume that if you haven’t caused a catastrophe with your
experimentations, you inevitably will.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an alchemist. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four
free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute
modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to
increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that
attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent
your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.
Alchemy
You understand the reactions between all manner of
reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your
needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft
activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that
allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost.
Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items
for free, and since each of them becomes more and more
powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving
behind those who don’t understand your strange science.
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (Player Core
252), and you can automatically identify alchemical items
that you have the formula for.
Formula Book
An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item
they can create. You start with a standard formula book
for free (Player Core 288). The formula book contains the
formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of
your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from
Alchemical Crafting and your research field. The catalog
of alchemical items begins on page 281.
Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas
for two common alchemical items to your formula book.
These new formulas can be for any level of item you can
create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it’s also
possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements
or from other alchemists, or to select the Inventor skill
feat so you can invent them (Player Core 257).
As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when
Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don’t need to
learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the
1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create
a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of
life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites.
Items with type entries that have widely varied functions
require separate formulas, but most alchemical items
have a structure similar to elixir of life.
Advanced Alchemy
During your daily preparations, you spend some time to
create alchemical items that can be used over the course of
the day. You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this,
you can use an alchemist’s toolkit instead of an alchemist’s
lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically
required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials
requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items
up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in
your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than
your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have
the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your
next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
Versatile Vials
You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into
versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs

and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing
special reagents. During your daily preparations, you
can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your
Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum
number of vials. If you’re below your maximum number,
you can gather reagents from the environment around
you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration
mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn’t prevent you from
participating in other exploration activities.
Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed
if not used by the next time you make your daily
preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type
you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a
versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick
Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to
the ways you can use a vial.
You can store all your versatile vials within your
alchemist’s toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though
versatile vials are physical objects, they can’t be
duplicated or preserved in any way.
Quick Alchemy
You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items
you need on the fly.
### Quick Alchemy [one-action]

## Alchemist Manipulate

Requirements You’re either holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit (Player Core 287) and you have a free hand.
You can either use up a versatile vial to make another
alchemical consumable at a moment’s notice or create an
especially short-lived versatile vial. Any effect created by an
item made with Quick Alchemy that would have a duration
longer than 10 minutes lasts for 10 minutes instead.
- Create Consumable You expend one of your versatile
vials to create a single alchemical consumable item
of your level or lower that’s in your formula book.
You don’t have to spend the normal monetary cost
in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a
Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it
remains potent only until the start of your next turn.
(As normal, you need only one formula for an item to
create any level of that item.)
- Quick Vial You create a versatile vial that can be used
only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your
research field (it can’t be used to create a consumable, for
example). This item has the infused trait, but it remains
potent only until the end of your current turn.
Research Field
Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe
have led you to focus on a particular field of research.
At 1st level, you choose your research field. These appear
on pages 60–62. This choice gives you more formulas, a
special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and
other benefits as you level up.
Alchemist Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain an alchemist class feat. These begin on page 62.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
Field Discovery 5th
You learn a discovery listed in your research field (page
60–62).

## Versatile Vials

Your versatile vials can be thrown like bombs, with the
following statistics.

## Versatile Vial

### Acid Alchemical Bomb Consumable Infused Splash
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Strike
This tiny glass flask contains volatile chemicals that can
be used offensively in a pinch.
Type lesser; Level 1
The bomb deals 1d6 acid damage and 1 acid splash damage.
Type moderate; Level 4
You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals
2d6 acid damage and 2 acid splash damage.
Type greater; Level 12
You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals
3d6 acid damage and 3 acid splash damage.
Type major; Level 18
You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals
4d6 acid damage and 4 acid splash damage.

59

Powerful Alchemy 5th
Alchemical items you infuse are particularly potent. When
you create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving
throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.

organs. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases
to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save,
you get a critical success instead.
Greater Field Discovery 13th
You learn an incredible discovery that advances your
understanding of your field, as described in your research
field (see below).
Medium Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
Weapon Specialization 13th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
to 4 if you’re legendary.
Alchemical Weapon Mastery 15th
You’ve mastered full capability with your weapons. Your
proficiency ranks for simple weapons, alchemical bombs,
and unarmed attacks increase to master.
Explosion Dodger 15th
Your experiments taught you to fling yourself out of the
way of sudden explosions. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
Abundant Vials 17th
You’re permanently quickened, and can use the extra
action only to use Quick Alchemy to create a quick vial.
You can create only one vial with this action, even if you
have double brew or a similar ability.
Alchemical Mastery 17th
Your concoctions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency
rank for your alchemist class DC increases to master.
Medium Armor Mastery 19th
Your skill with light and medium armor improves,
increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency
ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed
defense, increase to master.
Research Field
You might have a degree from a scientific institute,

correspond with other researchers in your field, or work
as a genius loner. Choose a research field. The research
fields presented in this book are as follows.
Formulas Add these formulas to your formula book at 1st
level, in addition to your other formulas.
Field Benefit Your studies and experiments taught you a specific
technique, which varies widely from one field to another.
Field Vials This ability modifies how you can use versatile vials.
Field Discovery, Advanced Vials, Greater Field Discovery The
remaining entries list your field’s benefits for class features
you gain at higher levels, including the level at which you
typically gain them in parentheses.
Bomber
You specialize in explosions and other violent reactions.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical bombs.
Field Benefit When throwing an alchemical bomb with the
splash trait, you can choose to deal splash damage to only
your primary target instead of the usual splash area.
Field Vials When you Strike with a versatile vial, you can
choose to have it deal cold, electricity, or fire damage
instead of acid damage.
Field Discovery (5th) You have calculated all the angles to
maximize a bomb’s splash. When you throw an alchemical
bomb with the splash trait, you can cause the bomb to deal
splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
1) instead of the normal amount.
Advanced Vials (11th) You can mix special ingredients into your
vials, such as magical dust or flakes of precious minerals.
When you create a versatile vial, you can choose to have it
treated as one special material of your choice, chosen from
adamantine, cold iron, and dawnsilver. If you’re wearing or
wielding an item of a different precious material when you
make the vial, you can choose that material instead.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) You can increase the splash on
your bombs to damage creatures within 10 feet, or 15 feet if
you have Expanded Splash.
Chirurgeon
You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical elixirs with the
healing trait (like lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, or minor
elixir of life).
Field Benefit You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for
anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as
prerequisites) and use your Crafting modifier in place of your
Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks.
Field Vials Your versatile vials can be used to heal a living creature
a number of Hit Points equal to the vial’s initial damage. A
creature can drink the vial for this benefit, or you can throw
the vial at a willing creature within 20 feet as an Interact
action to heal that creature. In either case, a vial used this way
loses the acid and splash traits and gains the coagulant and
healing traits, plus the elixir trait if a creature drinks it.
Field Discovery (5th) Your medicinal elixirs are quite fortifying.
When a creature drinks an infused elixir with the healing
trait that you have created, that creature gains a number
of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 0); these temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.
Advanced Vials (11th) When you use a field vial to heal a
creature that has half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, the
coagulant trait doesn’t apply to that healing.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) When you use Quick Alchemy
to create any type of elixir of life, the creature healed by the
item regains the maximum Hit Points possible, instead of
rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.
Mutagenist
You focus on bizarre mutagenic transformations that
sacrifice one aspect of a creature’s physical or psychological
being in order to strengthen another.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical mutagens.
Field Benefit When you use a mutagen, you gain a number
of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 0) plus half your level. These temporary Hit
Points last for 1 minute or until the mutagen’s duration
expires, whichever comes first. You can’t gain temporary HP
from drinking a mutagen again for 1 minute.
Field Vials You can drink the contents of one your versatile
vials to suppress the drawback you take from one mutagen
currently affecting you until the beginning of your next
turn. A vial used this way loses the acid, bomb, and splash
traits and gains the elixir trait. If you have more than one
drawback due to Combine Elixirs or a similar ability, drinking
the vial suppresses one drawback of your choice.
Field Discovery (5th) The mutagens flowing through your

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many alchemist
class features and abilities.
Additive: Feats with the additive trait allow you to add
special substances to alchemical consumables you create
when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable
(you can’t use additives with quick vials). You can add
only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can
add an additive only once per round, and most additive
abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you
can add them to.
Coagulant: Healing alchemical items with the coagulant
trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short
period of time. If a creature heals Hit Points from an item
with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily
immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent items with
the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any
other effects of those items).
Infused: An alchemical item with the infused trait has a
limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent
effects from your infused alchemical items, with the
exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end
when you make your daily preparations again.

blood have altered your body chemistry. When you roll a
Fortitude save while affected by a mutagen and dislike the
result, you can end the effect of the mutagen to reroll the
save. This is a fortune effect.
Advanced Vials (11th) When you drink one of your field vials,
you also gain resistance to physical damage for the same
duration. The resistance is equal to half your level.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) If you imbibe another mutagen
while you are under the effects of a mutagen, you can gain
the benefits and the drawbacks of both mutagens at once,
despite the fact that they both have the polymorph trait and
would not normally function together. If you come under
the effects of any further mutagens while benefiting from
two mutagens, you lose the benefit of one of the former
mutagens of your choice, while retaining the drawbacks
of all the mutagens. If you are under the effects of two
mutagens and you come under the effect of a non-mutagen
polymorph effect, you lose the benefits of the mutagens
while retaining the drawbacks of both. Your field vial benefit
applies to one mutagen of your choice.
Toxicologist
You specialize in toxins and venoms of all types.
Formulas Two common 1st-level alchemical poisons.
Field Benefit You can apply an injury poison you’re holding to
a weapon or piece of ammunition you’re wielding as a single
action, rather than as a 2-action activity. In addition, you
flexibly mix acidic and poisonous alchemical compounds.
Your infused poisons can affect creatures immune to
poison. A creature takes acid damage instead of poison
damage from your infused poisons if either the creature is
immune to poison or that would be more detrimental to the
creature (as determined by the GM). Typically, this benefit
applies when the creature has an immunity, resistance, or
weakness to one of the damage types.
Field Vials Your versatile vials have the poison trait and deal
poison damage instead of having the acid trait and dealing
acid damage (though your field benefit still applies). You
can apply the contents of a versatile vial to a weapon or
piece of ammunition as an injury poison. Add the versatile
vial’s initial damage to the first successful Strike with that
weapon or ammunition. The substance becomes inert at the
end of your current turn.
Field Discovery (5th) You have handled enough poisons to
become inured to their effects. You gain poison resistance
equal to half your level.
Advanced Vials (11th) When you damage a creature with a
versatile vial you’ve used as an injury poison, that creature
takes persistent poison damage equal to the vial’s splash
damage in addition to the initial damage.
Greater Field Discovery (13th) When a creature fails its initial
saving throw against an infused injury poison you created,
the wound sprays poison onto another creature adjacent
to it. The attacker who caused the injury chooses which
creature, if there’s more than one, and can choose to forgo
this effect. That creature is exposed to the poison. The
second creature doesn’t spread the poison further.

select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.

## 1St Level


## Alchemical Familiar Feat 1


## Alchemist

You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed
from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own
blood. You gain a familiar, which has the construct familiar
ability (Player Core 212); this is permanent, doesn’t require
the familiar to have the tough familiar ability, and doesn’t
count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2).
The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its
Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers.

## Alchemical Assessment Feat 1


## Alchemist

Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the
Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy on an alchemical item you
hold, you can do so as a single action, rather than spending
10 minutes.

## Blowgun Poisoner Feat 1


## Alchemist

You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun. Your
blowgun Strikes can apply injury poisons even if they deal
no damage due to a creature’s resistance. If you critically
succeed at a blowgun Strike using a poisoned dart, the
target’s initial save against the poison is one degree of
success worse than the creature rolls; this is a misfortune
effect.
In addition, if you make a blowgun Strike while hidden
or undetected, you don’t automatically become observed.
Instead, immediately attempt a Stealth check against the
Perception DC of the target. If you succeed, you don’t
become observed, and are hidden (if you were undetected,
you still become hidden rather than remaining undetected).

## Far Lobber Feat 1


## Alchemist

You’ve learned how to throw a longer distance. When you
throw an alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30
feet instead of the usual 20 feet.
### Quick Bomber [one-action] FEAT 1

## Alchemist

You keep your bombs and bomb-related reagents in easy-toreach
pouches from which you draw without thinking. You
Interact to draw a bomb, draw a versatile vial, or use Quick
Alchemy to create a bomb, then Strike with the bomb. If you
have the ability to create more than one bomb at a time with
Quick Alchemy (such as from the double brew class feature),
you can Strike with only one of the bombs you create with
this action.

## Soothing Vials Feat 1


## Alchemist

Prerequisites chirurgeon research field
The healing chemicals in your versatile vials also help calm a
patient’s mind. When a living creature affected by a mental
effect regains Hit Points from one of your versatile vials, it can
immediately attempt a new Will saving throw to end one mental
effect of its choice. It gains a +1 item bonus to the saving throw.

## 2Nd Level


## Clotting Elixirs Feat 2


## Alchemist

Your restorative concoctions have a clotting effect on the drinker’s
blood. When a living creature drinks an infused elixir with the
healing trait that you have created, it can immediately attempt a
DC 10 flat check to remove any persistent bleed damage.
### Improvise Admixture [one-action] FEAT 2

## Alchemist Concentrate Manipulate

Frequency once per day
Requirements You have fewer than your maximum number
of versatile vials, and you’re either holding or wearing an
alchemist’s toolkit.
You scrounge together enough ingredients from what’s left in
your alchemist’s toolkit to produce a few more versatile vials on
the fly. Attempt a Crafting check. The DC is usually a standarddifficulty
DC for your level, but the GM can assign a different
DC based on the circumstances. The number of vials you regain
depends on the result of your check (up to your maximum).
Critical Success You regain 3 versatile vials.
Success You regain 2 versatile vials.
Failure You regain 1 versatile vial.
Critical Failure You don’t regain any versatile vials.

## Pernicious Poison Feat 2


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a toxic additive to an alchemical poison to make
it splash poison on its target. A poison with this additive deals

## Sample Formula Book

You can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items
for your formula book, but the list below contains a good
selection of starter formulas. A beginner’s book with these
formulas called The Fundamentals of Alchemy has become
popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away
from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has
drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling
alchemists away from more innovative experiments.
Alchemical Item Formulas: Alchemist’s fire, frost
vial, cheetah’s elixir, elixir of life, glue bomb, smoke ball;
Bomber Acid flask, bottled lightning; Chirurgeon Antidote,
antiplague; Mutagenist Bestial mutagen, cognitive mutagen;
Toxicologist Arsenic, giant centipede venom

63

an amount of poison damage equal to the poison’s level if the
target succeeds at its initial saving throw against it. A target
that critically succeeds at its saving throw against this poison
still takes no damage.
### Revivifying Mutagen [one-action] FEAT 2

## Alchemist Concentrate

Requirements You are under the effects of a mutagen.
You metabolize a mutagen to heal yourself. You regain 1d6 Hit
Points for every 2 item levels of the required mutagen (minimum
1d6 HP), but the mutagen’s duration immediately ends.

## Smoke Bomb Feat 2


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a tarry additive to an alchemical bomb to make
it emit smoke. When thrown, in addition to its normal effects,
the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot burst. You
choose which corner of the target’s space (or the space in
which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures
within that area have the concealed condition, and all other
creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute
or until dissipated by a strong wind.

## 4Th Level


## Efficient Alchemy Feat 4


## Alchemist

Thanks to the time you’ve spent studying and experimenting,
you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches that
don’t require any additional attention. Increase the number of
items you can create each day with advanced alchemy to 6 +
your Intelligence modifier.
In addition, when you Craft alchemical consumables during
downtime, you can produce twice as many alchemical items in a
single batch without spending additional preparatory time. For
instance, if you are creating elixirs of life, you can craft up to
eight elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than four.
This doesn’t change the amount of alchemical reagents or other
ingredients required to craft each item, nor does it change your
rate of progress for days past the base downtime spent.

## Enduring Alchemy Feat 4


## Alchemist

You’ve learned how to make your personal energy last just a
little bit longer when quickly brewing ad hoc concoctions. When
using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or elixir, that
tool or elixir remains potent until the end of your next turn,
instead of losing its potency at the start of your next turn.

## Healing Bomb Feat 4


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a foamy catalyst to an elixir of life to turn it into
a topical projectile. You can throw the elixir as though it were
an alchemical bomb, with the following results.
Success The target is affected as though it drank the elixir, and
each living creature adjacent to it regains HP from the bomb

## Chirurgeon

You use alchemy for medicinal purposes, healing and

equal to the elixir’s number of damage dice (3 HP for a lesser
elixir of life, for example).
Failure The target regains HP equal to the elixir’s number of
damage dice.
Critical Failure The healing bomb has no effect.

## Invigorating Elixir Feat 4


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix an aromatic salve into an elixir with the healing
trait to soothe physical maladies. In addition to its normal
effects, the elixir can be imbibed by a creature prevented from
doing so (such as a sickened creature). In addition to its other
effects, the elixir attempts to counteract an effect imposing
one of the following conditions of the imbiber’s choice: clumsy,
enfeebled, sickened, or stupefied. Use half your level rounded
up for the counteract rank and your class DC – 10 for the
counteract modifier. The imbiber is then temporarily immune
to the effects of this additive for 10 minutes. The additive can’t
counteract curses, diseases, or conditions that are part of the
creature’s normal state.
### Regurgitate Mutagen [one-action] FEAT 4

## Alchemist Manipulate

Requirements You are under the effects of a mutagen.
You redirect a mutagen within your body to spit a stream of
stomach acid at a foe. A creature within 30 feet takes 1d6
acid damage for every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex
save against your class DC. On a failure, the creature is also
sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on a critical failure). The mutagen’s
duration immediately ends.

## Tenacious Toxins Feat 4


## Alchemist

Your victims tend to expire long before your poisons, since
the latter have been specifically formulated to last longer. The
maximum duration of any poison you create increases by an
amount equal to the poison’s stage 1 interval, to a maximum of
twice the poison’s maximum duration.

## 6Th Level


## Combine Elixirs Feat 6


## Additive Alchemist

You can add the full ingredients of a second elixir to an elixir you
make to create a hybrid concoction. You must expend an additional
versatile vial to make this combined elixir, and the ingredients
must be for an elixir you could create with Quick Alchemy. When
this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs
take effect. For example, you can combine two lesser elixirs of life
to create a combined elixir that heals twice the normal amount, or
you can combine a lesser darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye
elixir to both gain darkvision and find secret doors.

## Debilitating Bomb Feat 6


## Additive Alchemist

You can add a crystalline additive to an alchemical bomb to
have it undermine your enemy. Choose dazzled, deafened, offguard,
or a –5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with
the bomb hits, in addition to the bomb’s normal effects, the
target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take that
effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for
this saving throw, even if someone else throws the bomb.

## Directional Bombs Feat 6


## Alchemist

You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle
the splash in a cone that sprays in a single direction, potentially
allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines.
When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead
of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can create a
splash in a 15-foot cone. You choose the cone’s direction, but its
first square must be a square in the target’s space.
Special If you have the Expanded Splash feat or another ability
that increases the radius of splash damage, you can have the
splash damage be a 20-foot cone.

## Fortified Elixirs Feat 6


## Alchemist

Your treatments for diseases and poisons can be very
efficacious, though they tend not to last as long. A creature
that is under the effect of an infused antidote or antiplague
that you created can choose to reroll a failed Fortitude saving
throw against an appropriate affliction (poison for antidote and
disease for antiplague). The creature doesn’t gain the elixir’s
usual item bonus to the reroll, and after the reroll, the elixir’s
duration immediately ends. This is a fortune effect.

## Sticky Poison Feat 6


## Alchemist

A combination of additional viscosity and careful application
keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant
wear and tear. If your Strike with a poisoned weapon would
expend its poison without your target attempting an initial
save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure,
for example), attempt a DC 5 flat check. On a success, your
weapon remains poisoned. If your Strike with a poisoned
weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success,
your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.

## 8Th Level


## Alter Admixture Feat 8


## Alchemist Exploration

Requirements You are holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit.
Sometimes, you need to adapt your alchemical mixtures
to new situations. In a process that takes 10 minutes, you
change an item you created with advanced alchemy into
a similar item. You can change an alchemical bomb into

another type of alchemical bomb, an elixir into another type
of elixir, or a poison into another type of poison. If it’s unclear
whether two alchemical consumables are similar, the GM
decides. You must know the formula for the new item, and
the new item must be of the same or lower item level than
the original item. The new item still keeps the infused trait,
and it remains potent as long as the original item would have.
### Improved Invigorating Elixir  FEAT 8

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Invigorating Elixir
Choose physical invigoration or mental invigoration, and add
the listed conditions to those you can choose for an invigorating
elixir you create to counteract: Physical Invigoration blinded,
deafened, drained, paralyzed, slowed; Mental Invigoration
confused, controlled, fleeing, frightened, paralyzed, slowed.
Special You can select this feat a second time to choose a
different type of invigoration and add its options to those
you can choose.

## Mutant Physique Feat 8


## Alchemist

Basic mutagens that affect your physical form can bring out
the beast within you, turn you nigh invincible, or make your
body more elastic. While you’re affected by one of the listed
mutagens, you get an additional benefit.
- Bestial Mutagen You gain the mutagen’s item bonus to
your Intimidation checks. In addition, you increase the
damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step, and
they gain the deadly d10 trait.
- Juggernaut Mutagen You gain resistance to all physical
damage equal to half your level.
- Quicksilver Mutagen You can stretch your legs and
Step up to 10 feet, and you can squish and compress
your body, allowing you to make it through tight spaces
as if you were one size smaller, in addition to any effect
from Squeezing.
Special If you can be under the effects of multiple mutagens
(with the mutagenist greater field discovery, for example),
you get all relevant benefits.

## Pinpoint Poisoner Feat 8


## Alchemist

Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your
poisons. When you successfully Strike an off-guard creature
with a poisoned weapon or expose an off-guard creature to an
inhaled poison, that creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty
to its initial save against that poison.

## Sticky Bomb Feat 8


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix in a sticky additive to an alchemical bomb to make
its contents adhere and continue to deal damage. A creature
hit by a sticky bomb also takes persistent damage equal to and
of the same type as the bomb’s splash damage. If the bomb
already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts.

## 10Th Level

### Advanced Efficient Alchemy  FEAT 10

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Efficient Alchemy
You make an even-larger batch of alchemical items each
morning. Increase the maximum number of items you can
create with advanced alchemy to 8 + your Intelligence modifier,
or to 10 + your Intelligence modifier if you’re 16th level or higher.

## Expanded Splash Feat 10


## Alchemist

You can throw bombs at just the right trajectory to create
especially large and powerful explosions. When you throw
an alchemical bomb and that bomb has the splash trait, you
can have the splash damage affect all creatures within 10 feet
of the target instead of 5 feet. If you do, you gain a status
bonus to the bomb’s splash damage equal to your Intelligence
modifier. If you have the bomber 5th-level field discovery, this
additional damage applies even if you caused your bomb to
deal splash damage equal to your Intelligence modifier instead
of the normal amount, allowing your bombs to deal splash
damage equal to double your Intelligence modifier.
### Greater Debilitating Bomb  FEAT 10

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Debilitating Bomb
You have learned enhanced techniques and alchemical secrets
that allow you to expand the range of effects you can impose
with your bombs. When you use Debilitating Bomb, add the
following to the list you can choose from: clumsy 1, enfeebled
1, stupefied 1, or –10-foot status penalty to Speeds.

## Unstable Concoction Feat 10


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix a wondrous yet volatile liquid into an alchemical
consumable if it has an initial effect that uses dice. You
increase the size of any dice for the item’s initial effect by one
step. For instance, you could increase damage from a moderate
alchemist’s fire to 2d10 or healing from a moderate elixir of life
to 5d8+12. Because this affects only initial dice, it wouldn’t
increase unarmed attack damage from a bestial mutagen,
persistent damage from an acid flask, and the like. When this
item is activated, the creature activating it must succeed at a
DC 10 flat check or take acid damage equal to the item’s level.

## 12Th Level


## Extend Elixir Feat 12


## Alchemist

Integrating your own personal energy into the elixirs you create
causes them to affect you for longer. When you consume one
of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits
and a duration of 1 minute or longer, that elixir’s duration is
doubled. If you created the item with Quick Alchemy, this can’t
cause it to exceed the 10-minute duration limit.

67

### Supreme Invigorating Elixir  FEAT 12

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Invigorating Elixir
For the purposes of counteracting effects with invigorating
elixirs, treat your level as though it were 2 higher. Add the listed
conditions to those you can choose for an invigorating elixir you
create to counteract: petrified, stunned. You can also choose a
disease regardless of what, if any, conditions it imposes.

## Uncanny Bombs Feat 12


## Alchemist

Prerequisites Far Lobber
You lob bombs unerringly, despite obstructions or distance. When
you throw an alchemical item with the bomb trait, its range
increment increases to 60 feet, you reduce any circumstance
bonus to the target’s AC from cover by 1, and you automatically
succeed at the flat check when targeting a concealed creature.

## 14Th Level


## Double Poison Feat 14


## Alchemist

You can apply two different infused injury poisons to the same
weapon, though not to a piece of ammunition. Each poison’s
level must be 2 or more levels lower than your level. You have
to apply the two poisons individually. Once you’ve applied both,
the poisons merge into a double poison that uses the lower of
the two poisons’ DCs and number of stages. This double poison
is virulent only if both poisons were virulent. Combine the
effects of each stage of the poison on any creature affected by
it. For each stage of the poison, use the effects of both poisons
and the longer interval for that stage among the two poisons.

## Mutant Innervation Feat 14


## Alchemist

Basic mutagens that affect your mind and thoughts can make you
communicate telepathically, protect you from being detected, or
let you communicate with anyone. While you’re affected by one
of the listed mutagens, you get an additional benefit.
- Cognitive Mutagen You also gain the mutagen’s item
bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Medicine,
Nature, Performance, Religion, and Survival checks.
In addition, you can communicate telepathically with
creatures within 60 feet with whom you share a language.
The communication is two-way once you establish it, so a
creature you contact can also communicate with you.
- Serene Mutagen Detection, revelation, and scrying
effects of 9th rank (or 17th level) or lower detect nothing
from you or your possessions and auras. For instance,
detect magic would still detect other magic in the area,
but not any magic on you.
- Silvertongue Mutagen Ignore circumstance penalties you
would take to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and
Performance checks. In addition, your words transcend
linguistic barriers; everyone listening to you speak hears
your words as if you were speaking in their own language

## Mutagenist

You transform yourself and others with mutagens.

you survive transformations and combat, and Wisdom
helps keep your mind intact despite the warping.

(though you don’t actually speak that language, nor does this

### True Debilitating Bomb  FEAT 14

## Alchemist

Prerequisites Greater Debilitating Bomb
You have discovered increasingly devastating ways for your
bombs to impede your foes. When you use Debilitating Bomb,
add the following to the list of effects you can choose from:
enfeebled 2, stupefied 2, or a –15-foot status penalty to Speeds.

## 16Th Level


## Eternal Elixir Feat 16


## Alchemist

Prerequisites Extend Elixir
Your body readily accepts and retains minor changes. When
you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and
infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or more, you can
make the elixir’s duration indefinite. You can do so only if the
elixir’s level is half your level or lower. If you later consume a
different elixir and make it indefinite, the effect of the previous
indefinite elixir ends.

## Exploitive Bomb Feat 16


## Additive Alchemist

You can mix a refractile substance into an alchemical bomb to
foil resistances. Choose one damage type the bomb can deal.
Any damage dealt by the bomb—including initial, splash, and
persistent damage—ignores an amount of that resistance equal
to your level.

## Persistent Mutagen Feat 16


## Alchemist

Prerequisites Extend Elixir
You’ve trained your physical form to remain stable. Once per
day, when you consume an alchemical item with the infused
and mutagen traits, you can extend its duration to last until
the next time you make your daily preparations instead of
its normal duration. Unlike with the normal extension from
Extend Elixir, this can exceed the duration of an item created
with Quick Alchemy beyond its normal 10-minute limit.

## 18Th Level


## Improbable Elixirs Feat 18


## Alchemist

Your mastery of alchemical secrets enables you to replicate effects
most believe can be achieved only via magic. Select a number of
potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1); these
potions must be of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to
create these potions as alchemical consumables with the elixir
trait. When making these alchemical elixirs, you can substitute
alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical components,
and you can use an alchemist’s toolkit (for Quick Alchemy) or
an alchemist’s lab (for the Craft activity) instead of any other
required toolkits. Other than that, the formula doesn’t change.
Once you’ve chosen the potion formulas, they can’t be changed.

## Miracle Worker Feat 18


## Alchemist

Frequency once every 10 minutes
Your alchemical mastery can resuscitate the recently slain.
You can administer a major or true elixir of life to a creature
who has been dead for no more than 2 rounds. When you do,
that creature is immediately returned to life with 1 Hit Point
and becomes wounded 1.

## Perfect Debilitation Feat 18


## Alchemist

You have perfected the formulas for bombs that impede your
enemies. When you use Debilitating Bomb, your target avoids
the condition the bomb imposes only if it critically succeeds at
its saving throw.

## 20Th Level


## Alchemical Revivification Feat 20


## Alchemist

If you die while under the effect of at least one elixir, the
alchemical compounds in your bloodstream bring you back to
life at the start of your next turn. You’re affected by an elixir
of rejuvenation (page 288), then a true elixir of life, then your
choice of a major bestial mutagen, major juggernaut mutagen,
or major quicksilver mutagen as though you just imbibed it.
These automatic reactions don’t get any special benefits you
add when creating or using these items. Because you died, all
other alchemical compounds in your bloodstream are inert.
After being revived, you’re temporarily immune to Alchemical
Rejuvenation for 1d4 hours.
CRAFT PHILOSOPHER’S STONE FEAT 20

## Alchemist

Your research has paid off, culminating in the legendary
philosopher’s stone. You learn the formula for the philosopher’s
stone (page 295) and can add it to your formula book.

## Mega Bomb Feat 20


## Additive Alchemist Manipulate

You can add a highly explosive additive to an alchemical
bomb to turn it into a mega bomb. Throwing this bomb takes
a 2-action activity instead of a Strike. This isn’t a Strike, and
you don’t make an attack roll. The mega bomb explodes in
a 30-foot burst within 60 feet. It deals damage as if each
creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save. On
a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect
a primary target (such as off-guard from bottled lightning).
Though all targets in the area take splash damage as primary
targets, there is no further splash beyond that area.

69

Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful
weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability
without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon
a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part
of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a
nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their
rage only when it matters most.
