every level thereafter.

During combat encounters...
You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way
through. Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they
can exploit your relatively low defenses.
During social encounters...
You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion
can’t get the job done.
While exploring...
You look out for danger, ready to charge headfirst into battle in an instant.
You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow,
and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the
water’s surface. If something needs breaking, you’re up to the task!
In downtime...
You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your
mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.
You might...
- Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.
- Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.
- Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness.
Others probably...
- Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold
your own in a fight.
- See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.
- Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent
until the fight is done.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a barbarian. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
Attribute Boosts
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get
four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an
attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two
boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must
boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it
by 1.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of
this class.
Rage
You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.
### Rage [one-action]

## Barbarian Concentrate Emotion Mental

Requirements You aren’t fatigued or raging.
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a
number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your
Constitution modifier. While you are raging:
- You deal 2 additional damage on melee Strikes. This
additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed
attack is agile.
- You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless
they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.
Rage lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or
until the encounter ends, whichever comes first. You can’t
voluntarily stop raging. When you stop raging, you lose any
remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and can’t gain
temporary Hit Points from using the Rage action again for
1 minute.
Quick-Tempered
You gain the Quick-Tempered free action, which lets
you Rage at the slightest provocation.
### Quick-Tempered [free-action]

## Barbarian

Trigger You roll initiative.
Requirements You are not encumbered or wearing heavy
armor.
So long as you are able to move freely, your fury is instinctive
and instantaneous. You Rage.
Instinct
Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you
learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you.
Your instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid
certain behaviors, grants you increased damage and
resistances at higher levels, and allows you to select feats
tied to your instinct. For more information, see Instincts
on page 74.
Barbarian Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
barbarian class feat. These begin on page 77.
Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill feat. Skill feats have the skill trait. You must be
trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a
skill feat.
Furious Footfalls 3rd
The urge to fight drives you ever forward. You gain a +5-
foot status bonus to your Speed. This bonus increases to
+10 feet while you’re raging.

General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you
gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels
thereafter.
Brutality 5th
Your fury makes your weapons lethal. Your proficiency
ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and
unarmed attacks increase to expert. While raging,
you have the critical specialization benefits for melee
weapons and unarmed attacks.
Juggernaut 7th
Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for
Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success
instead.
Weapon Specialization 7th
Your rage helps you hit harder. You deal an additional
2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which
you have expert proficiency. This damage increases to 3
if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. You gain
your instinct’s specialization ability.
Raging Resistance 9th
Repeated exposure and toughened skin allow you to
fend off harm. While raging, you gain resistance equal
to 3 + your Constitution modifier to damage types based
on your instinct.
Reflex Expertise 9th
You’ve developed a knack for dodging danger. Your
proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
Mighty Rage 11th
Your rage intensifies and lets you hit harder at the start
of a fight. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian
class DC increases to expert. In addition, when you use
Quick‑Tempered, the first Strike you make during your first
turn deals additional damage equal to your Rage damage.
Greater Juggernaut 13th
You have a stalwart physiology. Your proficiency rank
for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you
roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a
failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Fortitude
save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the
damage you take.
Medium Armor Expertise 13th
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
Weapon Mastery 13th
Your rage makes you even more effective with the weapons
you wield. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons,
martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.
Greater Weapon Specialization 15th
The weapons you’ve mastered become truly fearsome in
your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization
increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in
which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if
you’re legendary. You gain a greater benefit from your
instinct’s specialization ability.
Indomitable Will 15th
Your rage makes it difficult to control you. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Perception Mastery 17th
Your instinct heightens each of your senses further. Your
proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.
Revitalizing Rage 17th
Your rage sustains you more frequently, leaving you
ready to jump into battle anew. Instead of needing to
wait 1 minute before you can gain temporary Hit Points
from Rage again, you need only to spend at least one full
turn not in a Rage.
Armor Mastery 19th
Your training and rage deepen your connection to your
armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium
armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.
Devastator 19th
Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care
about resistance, and your barbarian abilities are
unparalleled. Your proficiency rank for your barbarian
class DC increases to master. Your melee Strikes ignore
up to 10 resistance to the physical damage they deal.

73

Instincts
You channel your rage through an instinct. You decide
what your instinct means to you. It could be a creature or
symbol beloved by your clan, or a purely internal source or
filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, heritage, or state
of mind. Each instinct includes the following. Your choice
of instinct also serves as a prerequisite for many feats.
Instinct Ability You gain this fundamental ability related to
your instinct.
Specialization Ability (7th) You get this benefit when you gain
the weapon specialization class feature at 7th level.
Raging Resistance (9th) You get this benefit when you gain
the raging resistance class feature at 9th level.
Animal Instinct
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage,
granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that
revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give
rise to barbarians with this instinct. You might also
be at war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of
your personality, or you might be a descendant of a
werewolf or another werecreature. Select an animal
from the Animal Instincts table that best matches your
chosen animal.
Instinct Ability—Bestial Rage While raging, you gain your
chosen animal’s unarmed attack (or attacks), but you’re
unable to use weapons. The specific attack gained, the
damage it deals, and its traits are listed in the Animal
Instincts table. These attacks are in the brawling group.
Your Rage action gains the morph and primal traits.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage die size for
the unarmed attacks granted by your chosen animal by
one step, and increase the additional damage from Rage
from 2 to 5 for your chosen animal’s unarmed attacks.
If you have greater weapon specialization, increase the
damage from Rage from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal’s
unarmed attacks.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist piercing and slashing damage.

## Animal Instincts

Animal Attack Damage Traits
Ape Fist 1d10 B Grapple, unarmed
Bear Jaws 1d10 P Unarmed
Claw 1d6 S Agile, unarmed
Bull Horn 1d10 P Shove, unarmed
Cat Jaws 1d10 P Unarmed
Claw 1d6 S Agile, unarmed
Deer Antler 1d10 P Grapple, unarmed
Frog Jaws 1d10 B Unarmed
Tongue 1d4 B Agile, unarmed
Shark Jaws 1d10 P Grapple, unarmed
Snake Fangs 1d10 P Grapple, unarmed
Wolf Jaws 1d10 P Trip, unarmed
Dragon Instinct
You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and
manifest incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture
reveres draconic majesty, or you gained insights by
drinking or bathing in dragon’s blood or watching
a marauding wyrm burn your village. Select a
type of dragon from the Dragon Instincts table
as your instinct’s dragon type. These are the
dragons from Monster Core, but your GM
might allow you to choose dragons from other
sources and determine their tradition and
dragon breath type.
Instinct Ability—Draconic Rage While raging,
you can increase the additional damage from Rage
from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to match
that of your instinct’s dragon breath instead of the

damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you do
this, your Rage action gains the trait matching your dragon
instinct’s tradition, as well as the trait matching the damage
type where applicable.
Specialization Ability (7th) When you use draconic rage, you
increase the additional damage from Rage from 4 to 8. If
you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase
the damage from Rage when using draconic rage from 8
to 16.
Raging Resistance You resist piercing damage and the damage
type of your instinct’s dragon breath.

## Dragon Instincts

Dragon Tradition Dragon Breath
Adamantine Primal Bludgeoning
Conspirator Occult Poison
Diabolic Divine Fire
Empyreal Divine Spirit
Fortune Arcane Force
Horned Primal Poison
Mirage Arcane Mental
Omen Occult Mental
Fury Instinct
Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well
within you. You use your rage as you choose.
Instinct Ability—Unstoppable Frenzy Increase the additional
damage from Rage from 2 to 3. You gain a bonus 1st-level
barbarian feat.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the additional damage
from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater weapon
specialization, instead increase the additional damage from
Rage to 13.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist physical weapon damage,
but not physical damage from other sources (such as
unarmed attacks).
Giant Instinct
Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant.
This doesn’t necessarily mean you revere giants—you
might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You
could instead seem like a giant to other people due to
your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions
and ego.
Instinct Ability—Titan Mauler You can use a weapon built for
a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally
and when raging). If you’re not Small or Medium, you can
use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you.
You start with one such weapon, which you receive for free.
It must be a common melee or ranged weapon, it must have
a Price of 9 gp or less (not including the Price adjustment
for being a larger weapon), and it must be common or you
must otherwise have access to it. It is your personal weapon
and has no value if sold unless you later add runes to it,
and it has the normal Bulk for a weapon of its size (Player
Core 270).
When wielding a larger weapon in combat, increase your
additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have
the clumsy 1 condition because of the weapon’s unwieldy
size. You can’t remove this clumsy condition or ignore its
penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage from Rage
when using a larger weapon from 6 to 10; if you have
greater weapon specialization, increase it from 10 to 18.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist bludgeoning damage and
your choice of cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain
raging resistance.
Spirit Instinct
Whether you are emotionally sensitive to the spirits
around you; worship ancestors or apparitions; or are
haunted by the specter of an ancestor, relative, friend, or
foe, your rage takes the form of a spiritual possession.
Instinct Ability—Spirit Rage While raging, you can increase
the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 3 and change its
damage type to spirit, instead of the damage type for your
weapon or unarmed attack (choose each time you Rage). If
you choose to deal spirit damage, your weapon or unarmed
attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune,
which makes it more effective against incorporeal creatures,
and your Rage action gains the divine and spirit traits.
Specialization Ability (7th) When using spirit rage, increase
the damage from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater
weapon specialization, instead increase the damage when
using spirit rage to 13.
Raging Resistance (9th) You resist void damage, as well
as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of undead
creatures, regardless of the damage type.
Superstition Instinct
A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and counter
the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters. Whether
you’re a member of a superstitious family or culture
that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant battle against
wizards and witches, a survivor of a magical accident
that instilled an intense aversion in your mind and body,
or a scion of a bloodline known for its magic resistance,
your rage is inimical to magic. This makes you an
excellent mage hunter but slow to trust practitioners of
magical arts.

## Key Terms

You’ll see the following key terms in many barbarian
class features.
Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special
techniques that require too much exertion for you to
perform frequently. You can use only one action with the
flourish trait per round.
Rage: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage
trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.

75

Instinct Ability—Superstitious Resilience Your deep
superstition means it’s anathema for you to learn or Cast
a Spell, or to wield or use an item that can be activated
to Cast a Spell. If you violate this anathema, you lose
the instinct’s abilities and any feats that list the instinct
as a prerequisite until you spend 1 day of downtime
re-centering yourself, though you keep all your other
barbarian abilities.
While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves
against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from 2
to 3, or 4 against creatures you have witnessed Casting a
Spell within the last hour. When you Rage, you regain Hit
Point equal to the temporary HP you gained from the Rage
action; you then can’t regain HP in this way again for 10
minutes. While raging, if you willingly accept the effects
of a magic spell or effect, you are frightened 1. You cannot
reduce your frightened condition below 1 as long as you
are affected by the spell or effect.
Specialization Ability (7th) Increase the damage from Rage
from 3 to 7, or 8 against creatures you have witnessed
Casting a Spell within the last hour. If you have greater
raging specialization, instead increase the damage from
Rage to 13, or 16 against creatures you have witnessed
Casting a Spell within the last hour.

raging resistance class feature applies against all damage
you take from spells cast with these two traditions of magic,
regardless of the type of damage dealt by the spell.
Barbarian Feats
At every level that you gain a barbarian feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

## 1St Level


## Acute Vision Feat 1


## Barbarian

When you are raging, your visual senses improve, granting
you darkvision.

## Adrenaline Rush Feat 1


## Barbarian Rage

In the heat of battle, you are capable of amazing feats of
strength. While you are raging, increase your encumbered and
maximum Bulk limits by 2; you also gain a +1 status bonus to
Athletics checks to lift heavy objects, Escape, and Force Open.

## Draconic Arrogance Feat 1


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites dragon instinct
Few can sway you from your goals while the fury of combat
fills you. While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to saving
throws against emotion effects.
### Moment Of Clarity [one-action] FEAT 1

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

You push back your rage for a moment in order to think
clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with
the concentrate trait even if those actions don’t have the
rage trait.

## Raging Intimidation Feat 1


## Barbarian

Your fury fills your foes with fear. While you are raging, your
Demoralize and Scare to Death actions (from the Intimidation
skill and an Intimidation skill feat, respectively) gain the rage
trait, allowing you to use them while raging. As soon as you
meet the prerequisites for the skill feats Intimidating Glare
and Scare to Death, you gain these feats.

## Raging Thrower Feat 1


## Barbarian

Thrown weapons become especially deadly in your fury.
You apply the additional damage from Rage to your thrown
weapon attacks. If you have the Brutal Critical feat or the
devastator class feature, apply their benefits to thrown
weapon attacks.
### Sudden Charge [two-actions] FEAT 1

## Barbarian Flourish

With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride
twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least
one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy.
You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying,
or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.

## 2Nd Level


## Acute Scent Feat 2


## Barbarian

When your anger is heightened, your sense of smell improves.
While you’re raging, you gain imprecise scent with a range of
30 feet.
### Bashing Charge [two-actions] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Flourish

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You smash, bust, and charge through solid obstacles without
hesitation. Stride twice. Once during your movement, if your
movement passes through or ends adjacent to a door, window,
fence, wall, or similar obstacle, you can attempt an Athletics
check to Force Open the obstacle with a +1 circumstance bonus
to the roll; on a failure, your movement ends at that obstacle.
### Furious Finish [one-action] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Rage

Desperate to finish the fight, you pour all your rage into one
final blow. Make a Strike. If it hits, you gain a circumstance
bonus to damage equal to the number of rounds remaining
in your Rage (maximum 10). After this Strike, your Rage
immediately ends, and you are fatigued until you rest for at
least 10 minutes.
### Intimidating Strike [two-actions] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Emotion Fear Mental

Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their
confidence. Make a melee Strike. If you hit and deal damage,
the target is frightened 1, or frightened 2 on a critical hit.
### No Escape [reaction] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Rage

Trigger An enemy within reach attempts to move away
from you.
You keep pace with a retreating foe. Stride up to your Speed,
following the enemy and keeping it in reach throughout its
movement until it stops moving or you’ve moved your full
Speed. You can use No Escape to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim
instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.

## Second Wind Feat 2


## Barbarian

You can enter a second rage, but afterward you need to
catch your breath. When you Rage, you can choose to gain

77

temporary HP from the Rage even if 1 minute hasn’t passed
(or a full turn if you have the revitalizing rage class feature).
If you do, once this Rage ends you become fatigued until you
rest for 10 minutes.
### Shake It Off [one-action] FEAT 2

## Barbarian Concentrate Rage

You concentrate on your rage, overcoming fear and fighting
back sickness. Reduce your frightened condition value
by 1, and attempt a Fortitude save to recover from the
sickened condition as if you had spent an action retching;
you reduce your sickened condition value by 1 on a failure
(but not on a critical failure), by 2 on a success, or by 3 on
a critical success.

## 4Th Level

### Barreling Charge [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Flourish

Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe. You
Stride, attempting to move through your enemies’ spaces, and
make a melee Strike. Roll an Athletics check and compare the
result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space you
attempt to move through during your Stride, moving through
its space on a success but ending your movement before
entering its space on a failure. You can use Barreling Charge to
Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride, as long as you
have the corresponding movement type.
### Oversized Throw [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements You have one or more hands free.
With a great heave, you seize a piece of your surroundings,
such as a boulder, log, table, wagon, or chunk of earth, and
hurl it at your foes. The object must be your size or one
size smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk
for you to lift it in the first place. Make a ranged Strike with
the object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same
amount of damage it would deal on a success. The object is a
simple ranged weapon that deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage,
has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon
trait. The damage increases to 2d10 if you have weapon
specialization in simple weapons, or 3d10 if you have greater
weapon specialization.

## Raging Athlete Feat 4


## Barbarian

Prerequisites expert in Athletics
Physical obstacles can’t hold back your fury. While you are
raging, you gain a climb Speed and swim Speed equal to
your land Speed, and the DC of High Jumps and Long Jumps
decreases by 10. Your distance for a vertical Leap increases
to 5 feet vertically, and your distance for a horizontal Leap
increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, and to 20
feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
### Scars Of Steel [reaction] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites fury instinct
Frequency once per day
Trigger An opponent critically hits you with an attack that
deals physical damage.
When you are struck with the mightiest of blows, you can
flex your muscles to turn aside some of the damage. You gain
resistance to the triggering attack equal to your Constitution
modifier plus half your level.
### Spiritual Guides [reaction] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Fortune

Prerequisites spirit instinct
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail, but don’t critically fail, a Perception check or
a skill check.
Though no one sees them and only you can hear them, the
spirits around you constantly chatter, save when you are
raging. Sometimes they’re even helpful, and their guidance can
even cut through the haze of your rage. Reroll the triggering
check, using the second result even if it’s worse.

## Supernatural Senses Feat 4


## Barbarian Rage

Prerequisites Acute Scent or scent
Your scent is preternaturally sharp, and you can always rely
on your sense of smell to help guide you when your vision
is compromised. When you target a concealed or hidden
opponent while you are raging, you reduce the DC of the flat
check to 3 for a concealed target or to 9 for a hidden one.
### Swipe [two-actions] FEAT 4

## Barbarian Flourish

You make a wide, arcing swing. Make a single melee Strike
and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two
enemies, each of whom must be within your melee reach and
adjacent to the other. Roll damage only once and apply it to
each creature you hit. A Swipe counts as two attacks for your
multiple attack penalty.
If you’re using a weapon with the sweep trait, its modifier
applies to all your Swipe attacks.
### Wounded Rage [reaction] FEAT 4

## Barbarian

Trigger You take damage and are capable of entering a rage.
You roar in pain, awakening the rage within you. You Rage.

## 6Th Level


## Animal Skin Feat 6


## Barbarian Morph Primal

Prerequisites animal instinct
Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert.
When you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms
into a thick hide. You gain a +2 item bonus to AC (+3 if you

have the greater juggernaut class feature). The thickness of
your hide gives you a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of
+3. This item bonus to AC is cumulative with armor potency
runes on your explorer’s clothing, mystic armor, and bands

Prerequisites spirit instinct
You call forth an ephemeral spirit, typically the apparition of
an ancestor or a nature spirit, which takes the form of a wisp.
The wisp makes a melee wisp rush unarmed attack against
an enemy within 120 feet of you. The wisp’s attack modifier

or your weapon specialization damage, but circumstance and
status bonuses and penalties that would also affect the wisp’s

your normal reach. Until your rage ends, all your melee
weapons and unarmed attacks gain a reach of 10 feet. This

## Barbarian Rage

Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
piercing damage.

bleed damage equal to the weapon’s number of weapon
damage dice.

toward your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase your
penalty until you have made all your attacks.
