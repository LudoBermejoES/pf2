‌MOMENTARY MAGIC‌‌

## Everything in this part of the vaults is “impermanent,” as the boss says. Means that it goes away once it’s done what it was meant to do. Sometimes the boss waxes all philosophical about how some things can derive their value because of their impermanence, but I don’t know about all that. Sure, magic bullets you can fire once are fun, but wouldn’t a magic bullet you can fire twenty times be even better? Or a potion that never runs out? Or a talisman that you could just use over and over without it burning up? I guess that if you never used something up, you wouldn’t go

## looking to see what else is out there though, huh?

## One thing I can tell you for sure is that I wouldn’t suggest underestimating the power of anything you find here. A potion may not explode like a fireball, and a set of magical pigments might demand a level of skill that challenges even a talented polymath, but these are the treasures you’ll remember long after they’re gone. The talismans and items of wonder here are stories both fantastic and surprising, tools for doing the unexpected and exceeding the limits of your natural talents and cultivated skills. Plus, most of them fit easily in your pockets!

Secrets of Crafting

While many magical items in an adventurer’s toolkit might be carried over the course of their entire career, like a sword they ensorcell with ever more powerful runes, other magical items exist for a particular moment in time, meant to be used and then replaced. Talismans that attach to armor until their magic is used to avert disaster, catalysts whose only purpose is to be consumed during the casting of a spell to transform its effects, and many more types of magical items all fit within this broad category.

This chapter expands upon the existing types of magical consumables available within the game and introduces new types of consumables and consumable functions. Catalysts and fulus, originally introduced in *Pathfinder Secrets of Magic*, are expanded with new options. Magical missives are a new category of items that includes letters, musical compositions, and drawings that have a variety of effects based on the content the user inscribes onto the page.

Wondrous consumables make up a diverse category of new magic items that come in a wide array of shapes, sizes, and functions. From simple point‑and‑fire spellguns that act as a hybrid of a wand and firearm to launch a single magical effect, to magical instruments inscribed with a one‑time spell to summon an extraplanar creature into a musical battle, wondrous consumables can perform almost any function, though typically no more than once.

GMs seeking to get the most out of this section for their tables might have players look at a particular section of this chapter and suggest some items that suit their character’s story or desired play style. While part of the fun of using consumables can be having a quirky or unusual effect come into play in an unexpected way, it can also be fun for players to get their hands on items that will allow them pull off a particular cinematic scene or trick that creates a memorable table event.

A GM might also drop magical consumables into an adventure to serve as solutions to a cunning puzzle or enemy whose nature is one the party is not particularly suited for. Whether a potion to help a bard remember a tricky piece of information or an oil to help a fighter battle an ore louse without having it destroy their precious weapons and armor, consumables can be a fun and effective way to allow characters to engage with a story in a way that their normal skill set might not be fully suited for.

CREATING THE MOMENT

Getting the opportunity to use a consumable is often one of the most exciting parts of an encounter, but if the right opportunity to use a

consumable never arises, it ends up in the “sell pile” and becomes just another well‑described piece of treasure. Watch for moments in your campaign where you can create exciting opportunities for your players to use the consumables you’ve given them, and try to choose consumables that players will get a chance to use!

‌CATALYSTS‌‌

## Catalysts are, essentially, alchemy for magic. By adding the correct catalyst to a magical spell as it is completed, the spellcaster can manipulate and change the nature or form of the spell itself, creating an effect beyond what the unmodified energies could have achieved. Of course, this science is a constant threat to all dragonkind, given that our own bodies are saturated with magical energies capable

## of catalyzing spells in exactly this manner.

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** Cast a Spell                             This catalyst is made from twisted sapling bark harvested under a full moon. When used to cast a *charm* spell, the spell creates a blissful experience for one target of your choice. When the spell ends, even if you Dismiss it, the sudden mental dissonance between the charmed state and reality forces the target to attempt a Will save against your spell DC.

### Critical Success The target is unaffected.

### Success The target is stunned 1 or, if the spell ended because of a hostile action, confused for 1 round.

### Failure The target is stunned 2 or, if the spell ended because of a hostile action, confused for 1 round.

This aspect of the spell has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.‌

# NEVERCOLD ITEM 10+

CATALYST CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** Cast a Spell                             *Nevercold*, sometimes mistakenly referred to as nevercoal, is the charcoal left after wildfires in the First World. True to its name, *nevercold* remains warm to the touch.

CATALYST CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 60 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** Cast a Spell                             A pellet of tar mixed with the fur of a nocturnal creature, such as a bat, *nightpitch* used to cast a *darkness* spell makes the area of the darkness difficult terrain.

# UPON REFLECTION

Honestly, I can’t tell you much about catalysts. Magic is more the boss’s thing. I know, I know, kobolds are supposed to be mighty sorcerers because of our draconic heritage and all that, but I prefer gears. And chemicals. Ooh, and levers, levers are awesome, especially when you’ve got pulleys. Anyways, all I can tell you about catalysts is that one time I put a bunch of ghostcrackers in my pocket just in case I ever did try to cast a spell, and I kept seeing a scary guy in the mirror for a week! The boss took them away and told me to hang a “Do Not Touch, This Means You Purepurin” sign on the display case.

# SEVENTH PRISM ITEM 3+

CATALYST CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** Cast a Spell                           Beloved by the church of the Seventh Veil, a *seventh prism* is a crystal that disperses its internal light, casting an aurora of color. If you use a *seventh prism* to cast *dizzying colors*, targets are dazzled for twice as long as their saving throw indicates. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1 minute after its blinded condition ends. Motes of shifting rainbow hues cloud the eyes, making it difficult to see details.                 **Type** *triangular seventh prism*; **Level** 3; **Price** 10 gp         **Type** *pentagonal seventh prism*; **Level** 7; **Price** 52 gp

The area increases to a 20‑foot cone, and the DC for the flat check against the target being concealed increases to 7.

‌FULUS‌‌

## Fulus are humanity itself, expressed as magic labels. Individually, no fulu represents reality-bending power. Most of them use minor magics so gossamer-light that they can lie hidden in a folded slip of paper for years or even generations. But with patience, strategy, and enough numbers, they can transform into a force capable of turning aside tides of demons or thwarting even a dragon’s will, at least temporarily.

# ANATHEMA FULU ITEM 11

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL |

### Price 250 gp

### Usage affixed to the ground in four spaces along a circle with a 20‑foot radius; Bulk —

**Duration** 1 hour                               First used by celestial‑touched nephilim of Tianjing to weaken qlippoth, an *anathema fulu* comes in four pieces, one placed in each cardinal direction. Choose one of the following traits when activating the fulus: celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, monitor, or undead. If a creature with that trait starts its turn in the area, it must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw or become sickened 2 until the start of its next turn. On a critical success, the creature becomes temporarily immune to any *anathema fulus* for 1 hour. Regardless of the save result, if you subsequently cast *banishment* on such a creature in

the area, the creature takes the –2 penalty described in that spell for adding a special cost of an object that’s anathema to that creature. The fulu acts as that object; you don’t need to add it. If a creature affected by this penalty rolls a saving throw against *banishment*, the caster can use a free action to force the result one step lower. Doing so burns the whole fulu out, ending the effect. If any of the fulu’s pieces are moved or destroyed after activation, the effect ends.

DEMOLITION FULU                    ITEM 3+

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL |

**Usage** affixed to an object or structure; **Bulk** —           A *demolition fulu* allows a saboteur or excavator to be far away from the scene when demolition happens. The fulu crumbles to ash over 5 minutes to 8 hours, as you determine when you place the fulu. Once the duration ends, the fulu lowers the

76

‌Hardness of the object it’s affixed to by an amount equal to the fulu’s level and then deals the listed damage to the object. A *demolition fulu* serves as a hazard with a Stealth DC to detect it and Thievery DC to disable it according to its type.         **Type** lesser; **Level** 3; **Price** 12 gp‌

Sometimes called the *moth fulu*, good for destroying softer objects; 3d6 bludgeoning damage, DC 17.               **Type** moderate; **Level** 11; **Price** 275 gp

Sometimes called the *termite fulu*, good for destroying wood objects; 6d6 bludgeoning damage, DC 28.               **Type** greater; **Level** 17; **Price** 2,750 gp

Sometimes called the *rust fulu*, good for destroying metal objects; 10d6 bludgeoning damage, DC 37.

# DISCORD FULU ITEM 5

CONSUMABLE FULU MAGICAL MISFORTUNE

### Price 22 gp

### Usage affixed to a creature; Bulk —

**Duration** 1 hour                               Incorporating green in its writing, a *discord fulu* is a popular but unethical tool often deployed on romantic rivals to foil their advances. While the fulu is affixed to it, a creature treats its attitude toward other creatures as one step worse than it is. The creature also takes a –1 status penalty to Diplomacy checks. The first failure the creature rolls on a Diplomacy check becomes a critical failure instead, and the fulu turns to ash, ending its effect.

# DRAGONFLY FULU ITEM 7

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |  |

### Price 60 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

**Activate** [free-action] (concentrate) **Trigger** You take the Leap action.   Tradition says the *dragonfly fulu* should be affixed to the upper back, like the wings of an insect. When you Activate this fulu, you gain a +2 status bonus to Athletics checks to High Jump or Long Jump for 1 minute. During this time, you can attempt an Athletics check to High Jump or Long Jump as a single action without the Stride requirement. You can also High Jump or Long Jump from a nonsolid substance, such as air or water, but if you use this power of the fulu, its effects ends after you jump.

# ESCAPE FULU ITEM 7

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |  |

### Price 70 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

**Activate** [free-action] (concentrate) **Trigger** You attempt to Escape.     The *escape fulu* is a charm common among wealthy people, who wear the talisman in case of kidnapping. When you Activate this fulu, for 1 minute, you gain a +2 status bonus to your attempts to Escape as well as to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak.

# GHOST COURIER FULU ITEM 8

CONSUMABLE FULU MAGICAL

### Price 100 gp

# STAMPS AND SEALS

Fulus from official temples and shrines often sport a red stamp indicating that the charm written on the fulu is a divine decree. The stamp serves as a signature or wax seal bearing a signet’s imprint. In fact, stamps are still a preferred way of signing a document in some regions. It’s also a practice kept in the traditional painting and calligraphy community for artists’ signatures.

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk —

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate)               The inscription on a *ghost courier fulu* leaves space for a message, and a prominent red stamp indicates which *ghost delivery fulu* this fulu homes in on (see below). When you Activate this fulu, you dictate a message up to 25 words long that then magically appears on the paper in the language you spoke. The fulu then disappears into the Ethereal Plane, arriving at the assigned *ghost delivery fulu* in 2d10 hours, provided that fulu is within 500 miles. There, the fulu’s magic dissipates, but the message remains. If the fulu takes any damage in transit, it has a 50% chance to drop back into the Universe, intact but bereft of magic.

# GHOST DELIVERY FULU ITEM 8

CONSUMABLE FULU MAGICAL

### Price 100 gp

**Usage** affixed to structure, object, or creature; **Bulk** — **Duration** 1 week                               A *ghost delivery fulu*’s inscription resembles a dovecote with spirits around it, and it has a prominent stamp in red wax. This fulu activates once affixed, becoming the homing location of *ghost courier fulus* with a matching stamp. Delivered *ghost courier fulu* messages (see above) stick to the *ghost delivery fulu* but can be easily removed.

# GOLDEN BREATH FULU ITEM 20

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOMMON | CONSUMABLE FULU HEALING | MAGICAL | TALISMAN | VITALITY |  |

### Price 8,100 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

**Activate** [free-action] (concentrate) **Trigger** You take damage.           An enterprising chirurgeon reversed the forces evoked by a *void thousand-pains fulu* [(page 79)](#bookmark178) to create the *golden breath fulu*, which fortifies qi and the body as elements move out of balance. When you Activate this fulu, you regain 75 Hit Points and attempt a flat check to end any persistent damage affecting you. The fulu is particularly appropriate help for ending any persistent damage. Also, if you would regain more Hit Points from the fulu than your maximum, you can gain the excess as temporary Hit Points or distribute the excess among creatures of your choice within 30 feet. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.

# ‌THE QUIET CORNERS‌

Remember how I said magic isn’t really my thing? Well, fulus are a little different. They make me think of traps and snares, the subtle sciences of people who play the long game. Ziik the ratcatcher hasn’t had to look for an actual rat in years. He just puts up sentry fulus in all the places rats like to creep and rolls down with his squisher whenever one’s triggered, then goes back to napping. Ziik knows where all the best places to nap are, so if your feet get tired, make sure to ask him about them. You can rest easy knowing there won’t be any rats to bite your toes, and on the off chance that one slips in, Ziik’ll be right there with the squisher.

# INVENTOR’S FULU ITEM 6

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |  |

### Price 50 gp

### Usage affixed to an innovation; Bulk —

### Activate [free-action] (concentrate) Trigger You critically fail an action

  with the unstable trait.                           Some inventors in Tian Xia put fried snacks near their innovations, a charm to make devices behave as intended. The practice rubbed off on other inventors, who replaced the food with a drawing on an *inventor’s fulu*. When you Activate the fulu, your critical failure becomes a failure, and you can spend just 1 minute to return your innovation to full functionality. The fulu then burns up, and its effects end.

# KAIJU FULU ITEM 13

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOMMON | CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL |

### Price 500 gp

### Usage affixed to a load‑bearing wall or pillar; Bulk —

**Duration** 1 week                                 Despite the name, a *kaiju fulu* protects a building against damage of all sorts. When an affixed structure no larger than 100 feet × 100 feet and up to 50 feet tall takes damage, the structure is as hard as standard‑grade adamantine against that damage and any damage that occurs within 1 hour thereafter. The fulu then crumbles to dust, and its effects end.

# MOURNER’S DAWNLIGHT FULU ITEM 9

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOMMON | CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL |

### Price 120 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk —

**Activate** [three-actions] (concentrate, manipulate)               A *mourner’s dawnlight fulu* is a stack of pages that resembles joss paper, used to locate the remains of the lost. When you Activate the fulu, you envision a specific object or deceased creature you’re familiar with and want to find. You then rip the fulu into pieces and let them drift in the wind. If the item or

creature you seek is within 500 feet, the pieces flutter through the air and land on the target, or on the surface closest to a buried or otherwise obscured target. If the torn fulu lands or fails to locate the desired target, its magic ends.

# PORACHA FULU ITEM 5

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOMMON | CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |  |

### Price 30 gp

**Usage** affixed to armor; **Bulk** —                         Folklore from near the Forest of Spirits tells of the origin of the *poracha fulu*. Once, a traveler saved an eight‑legged feline who turned out to be a poracha prince. In return, the prince gave the traveler a fulu that later prevented a fast‑acting poison from slaying them. Traditionally, one wears a string of up to nine *poracha fulus*, which counts as one talisman. Each time you take persistent damage, one *poracha fulu* affixed to you negates the damage and crumbles to dust. This response is automatic, but you can use a free action (envision) to prevent your fulus from responding. If you do, any *poracha fulus* affixed to you never respond to that persistent damage.

# REFLECTED MOONLIGHT FULU ITEM 14

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FORTUNE | FULU | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |  |

### Price 750 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

### Activate [reaction] (concentrate) Trigger You fail to save against a

  death or void effect.                           An acolyte accidentally left fulu paper outdoors overnight during a divine ceremony to Tsukiyo conducted only during a supermoon, creating the first *reflected moonlight fulu*. When you Activate this fulu, you reroll your saving throw against the triggering effect and take the better result. If this new roll is a critical success, the effect is reflected on its creator, who’s treated as the effect’s target, with any void damage converted to vitality damage. A reflected effect or spell affects only the original creator, even if it was an area spell or one that affects more than one creature.

# SENTRY FULU ITEM 4

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | FULU | MAGICAL |

### Price 15 gp

### Usage affixed to the ground; Bulk —

**Activate** [three-actions] (concentrate, manipulate)                   A *sentry fulu* depicts an armed guard. When you activate the fulu, it takes the shape of a Tiny humanoid guard made of paper and keeps watch over an area in a 20‑foot burst. The guard has a Perception DC of 20, along with precise visual senses and imprecise hearing and vibrational sense to detect creatures moving in its area, including through the air. You dictate whether the guard remains still in its area or patrols it; if the latter, you also determine the path the guard takes, at a Speed of 25 feet. You also determine a password others must give the guard to bypass it. If a creature enters the area without giving the password, the sentry creates either an audible or mental alarm. An audible alarm has the sound and volume of a human shouting, as well as the auditory trait, allowing each creature

78

‌that can hear it to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up if they’re asleep. The mental alert reaches you if you’re within 60 feet of the active guard (see below). The guard remains active for 8 hours, and then the fulu is consumed.‌‌

If you have more than one *sentry fulu*, you can set up several that function as a unit, provided their areas touch or overlap. When one sounds its alarm, the alarm passes through all of them, so you must be within range of only one to hear it or receive the mental alert. Creatures that give the correct password to one *sentry fulu* in a unit need not give that password again to the others. The destruction of one fulu‑created guard in a unit sets off the alarm in others in connected areas.

# STUMBLING FULU ITEM 3

CONSUMABLE FULU MAGICAL

### Price 10 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

# COLORS AND THE ELEMENTS

The color of a fulu’s paper component often reflects which of the five elements the fulu draws on. Fulu makers sometimes use element cycles by picking the appropriate colored inks to feed and boost the power of a fulu. For example, the power of a black fulu, the base element of which is water, can be heightened if the ink used to draw the scripts is metallic silver, a reflection of the metal element. In addition, each element corresponds to specific body parts, humors, emotions, and other aspects of the material world. On Golarion, this means a fulu adept can grow so powerful as to manipulate reality to their will.

The clumsy condition remains until the target takes a total of 1 Interact action, plus 1 additional Interact action per value of the clumsy condition above 1, to properly reclothe itself.

# THOUSAND-PAINS FULU ITEM 5+

### Usage affixed to a creature; Bulk —

**Duration** 1 minute                             Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a *thousand-pains fulu* blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a basic Fortitude save against damage determined by the fulu’s type. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu’s duration.       **Type** *burl thousand-pains fulu*; **Level** 17; **Price** 2,700 gp Though this green fulu looks inviting, it has a foreboding aura. The DC is 35, and the fulu deals 10d8 poison damage, causing the target’s body to respond adversely to their qi. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes fire damage, it takes 2d8 persistent poison damage as well. These effects have the poison trait.                                       **Type** *blade thousand-pains fulu*; **Level** 8; **Price** 90 gp

This red fulu feels rigid, its edges sharp, and looking at it makes you feel feverish. The DC is 23, and the fulu deals 5d6 slashing damage as meridians burst and cut through flesh. On a failure or critical failure, if the target fails to take an action with the manipulate or move trait on each of its turns, it takes 1d6 persistent slashing damage.

**Type** *icicle thousand-pains fulu*; **Level** 14; **Price** 630 gp Looking at this black fulu leaves you queasy and cold. The DC is 30, and the fulu deals 10d6 cold damage as the target’s qi warps and drains. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes damage from a poison or disease effect or becomes sickened, it takes 2d6 persistent cold damage. These effects have the cold trait.                               **Type** *needle thousand-pains fulu*; **Level** 11; **Price** 270 gp Picking up this white fulu feels like you’ve stabbed your hand with a pin. The DC is 27, and the fulu deals 7d6 piercing damage as hair, nails, and connective tissues stab inward. On a failure or critical failure, if the target then takes an action with the move trait, it takes 2d6 persistent piercing damage.  **Type** *stone thousand-pains fulu*; **Level** 5; **Price** 30 gp

This fulu’s yellow parchment feels dusty and stiff. The DC is 19, and the fulu deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage as muscles swell to crush joints and bones. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes electricity damage, it takes 1d6 persistent bludgeoning damage as well.                         **Type** *void thousand-pains fulu*; **Level** 20; **Price** 8,100 gp

The black dot at the center of this purple fulu draws in energy like a bottomless hole. The DC is 38, and the fulu deals 12d10 void damage by dissipating the target’s qi. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes any other damage within 1 minute, it takes 2d10 persistent void damage as well. These effects have the death and void traits. Each time the target takes this persistent damage, any creature within 30 feet of it can use a reaction to gain temporary Hit Points equal to the persistent damage taken, distributing the available temporary Hit Points among those that take the reaction. If the creature that affixed the fulu is within 30 feet, it instead gains all the available temporary Hit Points, if it wishes. These temporary Hit Points disappear after 1 minute.

‌MAGICAL AMMUNITION‌‌‌

## The bipeds have stories of black arrows piercing dragon scales and giant cannons capable of knocking dragons out of the sky. These stories are true as often as not, though they miss some important realities. By my estimation, dragons who are foolish enough to bare their weaknesses to lesser creatures or lack the speed and cunning to avoid orbs of metal heavier than a farmer’s wagon deserve their fate. When I see archers,

## I send kobolds. When I see cannons, I unleash magical devastation from the safety of my vaults.

## —Valashinaz, Mistress of the Vault

The following items are magical ammunition for ranged weapons. Each item’s stat block includes an Ammunition entry that lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as, or “any” if it’s not limited to any type. All stat blocks for ammunition presented here omit the Usage and Bulk entries; use the normal rules found in the weapon’s ammunition entry, such as those in the Ranged Weapons table on page 281 of *Player Core*, when determining reload times and Bulk for these magical ammunitions.

When attacking with magical ammunition, use your ranged weapon’s fundamental runes to determine the attack modifier and damage dice. Don’t add the effects of your weapon’s property runes unless the ammunition states otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic ammunition deals damage on a hit normally, in addition to any listed effects, unless its description says otherwise.

Regardless of whether an attack with magic ammunition hits or misses, launching the ammunition consumes its magic. Magic ammunition is made of normal materials, not precious materials, unless stated otherwise.

Activated Ammunition

If magic ammunition doesn’t have an Activate entry, it’s activated automatically when it’s launched. Types of magical ammunition that have an Activate entry must be activated with additional actions before being used. Once you Activate the ammunition, you must shoot it before the end of your turn. Otherwise, it deactivates (but it isn’t consumed), and you must Activate it again before you can use it. If you shoot the ammunition without Activating it first, it functions as non‑magical ammunition and is consumed.

The action required to Activate the ammunition is in addition to actions it takes to reload your weapon.

# BLACK TENDRIL SHOT ITEM 7+

| --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                         A glistening, tar‑like substance that’s displeasing to the touch coats a *black tendril shot*. When the activated ammunition hits

a target, it exudes tendrils that encase the target, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The ammunition’s effects last until the target Escapes. DCs for the saving throw and Escape vary by type.

### Critical Success The target is unaffected.

### Success The target is slowed 1 but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Escape the ammunition’s effect

### Failure The target is slowed 1.

Critical  Failure    The    target    is    slowed    2.

### Type lesser; Level 7; Price 60 gp

Both          DCs          are          25.

### Type moderate; Level 12; Price 360 gp

Both          DCs          are          31.

### Type greater; Level 17; Price 2,160 gp Both DCs are 39.

| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Price 25 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                           This ammunition bears a rune with three lines radiating out, each ending in a circle. When an activated *bola shot* hits a target, it deals nonlethal bludgeoning damage. Compare the attack roll to the target’s Reflex DC to determine the shot’s other effects.

# CONDUIT SHOT ITEM 6+

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                           Fine lines of djezet sparkle in *conduit shot*. When you Activate it, you name up to four creatures, in addition to you, that the ammunition’s magic works for. When a *conduit shot* hits a target, which can be a square, it remains intact. It moves with a creature it struck, unless the GM determines otherwise, until that creature regains any Hit Points. If it doesn’t stick to the target, the active ammunition instead falls into the target’s space, remaining active.

‌If you or one of the four selected creatures include the ammunition in the area of a spell that is 3rd rank or lower; has an area of a burst, cone, or line; and does not have a duration, the djezet in the ammunition flares in striations of red light, increasing the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that has a radius of at least 10 feet or to the length of a cone or line normally 15 feet long or smaller. For a larger cone or line, add 10 feet to the length. These increases are based on the spell’s original area, ignoring any increases due to other effects, such as the Widen Spell feat. Increasing a spell’s area destroys the ammunition, which otherwise remains active for 1 minute.  **Type** lesser; **Level** 6; **Price** 50 gp                         **Type** moderate; **Level** 10; **Price** 200 gp‌

The  spell    can  be    5th  rank    or  lower.

# THE LONELY LADY

These vaults always make the boss extra cranky. I think it’s because the magical arrows remind her of the adventurers who killed her favorite hatchling, Vassekith. Vass was kind of a jerk, but the boss liked him. She let him hang around a lot longer than the rest of her brood, who she chased out as soon as they started eyeing her collection. Poor Vass tried to raid a temple in Hwanggot and ended up playing pin cushion for the temple archers and their fate shot arrows. The boss went positively cataclysmic after that, and I’m not sure the temple is there anymore. Let’s talk about something a bit more positive, huh? These imp shot bullets over here, these are hilarious….

—Purepurin

you to teleport to a location near where the ammunition hits. If you hit a creature, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to that creature. If you fire at a square, you can teleport to a space that contains that square or an unoccupied space adjacent to it. The teleportation fails if no unoccupied space is available to you.

# FATE SHOT ITEM 6

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Price 50 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                       *Fate shot* is made of a nickel‑steel alloy carved with the smiling face of a comedic player on one side, while the other side holds the frown of a tragic dramatist. When you hit a target with this ammunition, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, treat all the damage dice for your attack as though they rolled the average damage +1, rounded up (for example, a *fate shot* arrow fired from a shortbow would normally deal 1d6, which has an average of 3.5, so you deal 5 damage). This doesn’t affect additional damage dice that only happen on a critical hit, such as those added by the deadly trait. On a failure, roll the damage, but your target takes half damage, and you take the remaining amount as mental damage.

# GARROTE SHOT ITEM 15

### Price 1,200 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                         Wiry designs mark the silvery coating on a *garrote shot*.

# IMP SHOT ITEM 5

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 24 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                             This black‑and‑red ammunition contains an egg‑shaped capsule. When an activated *imp shot* hits, the capsule cracks open and releases a manifestation that resembles a Tiny imp that can’t act in any way or provide benefits outside those described here. If the Strike misses the target, the imp appears, makes a rude gesture at you, and vanishes in a puff of sulfuric smoke. On a hit, though, the imp harries the target for up to 1 minute, remaining in the target’s space, slapping, nipping, hurling insults, and moving with the target as it moves. A creature harried by the imp is off‑guard and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks. At the start of your turn on each round while the imp is active, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, the imp makes a final vulgar gesture at the target and vanishes in a cloud of brimstone.

# LIGHTNING ROD SHOT ITEM 7

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 60 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                       Made from a shaft of silver with a gleaming copper tip, the *lightning rod shot* crackles with electricity as it flies through the air. When a *lightning rod shot* strikes a target, it remains intact. It moves with a creature it struck, unless the GM determines otherwise, until that creature regains any Hit Points. If it doesn’t stick to the target, it falls to the ground and becomes inactive. If the target of this shot is within 10 feet of any creature or target that takes electricity damage, the target of this shot takes 1 electricity damage for each die of damage taken by the nearby creature or target. If the target of this shot takes electricity damage from a spell or attack, it also takes 1 additional electricity damage for each die of damage dealt. If the spell or attack allows a saving throw to reduce the damage, the target of this shot takes a –1 circumstance penalty to the save. This shot remains active for 1 minute, after which it falls to the ground and crumbles to dust.

# MAGNETIC SHOT ITEM 7+

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                               Shiny gray metal that slightly thrums when touched makes up the metal parts of a *magnetic shot*. When activated, the shot is more effective against a target wearing metal armor or made of metal. The activated ammunition grants a circumstance bonus to attack rolls against such targets, according to its type. Due to magnetic acceleration, the ammunition deals more damage and has deadlier critical hits, also according to its type.

### Type lesser; Level 7; Price 60 gp

The ammunition grants a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll, deals two additional weapon damage dice, and is deadly d8. **Type** moderate; **Level** 12; **Price** 360 gp

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 250 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate)                           *Mindlock shot* is made of luminous ectoplasm in a crystalline form. When you Activate this ammunition, you pick a Stride or Strike. If you hit a creature with the ammunition, it falls under a mental effect that makes it use its first action on its next turn to take the action you picked. It chooses exactly how to use that action, and if you choose Stride, the target can Step if doing so is beneficial for it. On a critical hit, the target must use its next 2 actions to do as you chose, within the same parameters.

# RANGING SHOT ITEM 3

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 9 gp

### Ammunition any

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate)                           Strange striations and pits mark the head of a *ranging shot*. When the activated ammunition is fired, it sends out whistling pings along its path until it hits something or reaches its maximum range. As long as you can perceive the sounds the ammunition makes, you can tell exactly how far it has flown. The sounds are audible to creatures who didn’t Activate the ammunition, but they receive no special information from the *ranging shot*’s whistling.

# SIGHTING SHOT ITEM 8

CONSUMABLE LIGHT MAGICAL

### Price 72 gp

### Ammunition any

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate)

Eyes are carved onto a *sighting shot*. When you Activate the ammunition, it glows, shedding bright light for 20 feet and dim light for 20 feet beyond that. If you shot the activated ammunition, your mind swirls with images of what the *sighting shot* passed and hit as if you sprinted along the ammunition’s course. You see this path as if with your normal visual senses. Once a *sighting shot* hits anything or reaches its maximum range, it stops transmitting images to you. A *sighting shot*’s light is visible to creatures who didn’t Activate the ammunition, but they receive no special information from it.

When you Activate it, you name up to four creatures, in addition to you, that the ammunition’s magic works for. When *spell echo shot* strikes a target, which can be a square, it remains intact. It moves with a creature it struck, unless the GM determines otherwise, until that creature regains any Hit Points. If it doesn’t stick to the target, the active ammunition instead falls into the target’s space, remaining active. If you or one of the four selected creatures include the ammunition in the area of a spell that is 5th rank or lower; has an area of a burst, cone, or line; and does not have a duration, the materials in the ammunition immediately duplicate that spell with the same parameters. A duplicated spell can’t be duplicated again by another effect. Duplicating a spell destroys the ammunition, which otherwise remains active for 1 minute.

‌MISSIVES‌‌‌‌

## Yay, letters! I like to come here sometimes and write poems. I’m not allowed to write letters to anyone else anymore, not after what happened to poor Tik. I only meant to show him what a meanie he was by drawing that picture... I didn’t know it would explode and splash acid all over him! How was I supposed to know which of the two completely identical stacks of parchment was the one that blows up? That’s why I’ve labeled everything in here with these helpful pictures of what happens to the people who read them.

## —Purepurin

A missive is a piece of magical stationery that must be crafted and composed before it can be activated. All missives have the missive and consumable traits. Missives are often constructed of paper, parchment, or vellum, but any other thin, portable material that can hold writing or embossing upon it can be crafted into missives. After being crafted, the missive is a blank sheet until a message is composed upon it, completing its magic.

Composing Missives

Before a missive can be activated, it must be composed. Composing a missive means preparing the missive’s contents—visual, tactile, or both. Then, the missive Activates when it’s examined. Missive contents can include anything that might be written or embossed on writing material. Contents change the missive’s effects only if the missive’s description says they do. Composing a missive requires using the Compose Missive activity.

COMPOSE                    MISSIVE

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| EXPLORATION | MANIPULATE |

You spend 10 minutes drawing, writing, or inscribing, covering the missive’s surface with text, images, or embossing.

Activating Missives

Unless otherwise stated in a missive’s description, a missive is activated automatically when a creature holding or touching the missive reads or examines the missive’s contents. Doing so requires an amount of time noted in the missive’s description, but is typically 2 actions—one to open the missive or arrange it in their hands (manipulate) and the other to absorb part of the contents (concentrate). A missive doesn’t have to be read or examined in its entirety to be activated, nor does a creature need to know the missive is magical to Activate it. One can Activate missives unintentionally! The creature does need to be able to understand the missive to Activate it, however—a creature who speaks only Sakvroth couldn’t Activate a missive in Common. Someone who knows they hold a missive can avoid Activating it by not examining it, and possibly by Interacting to close it, if it’s open.

| AUDITORY | CONSUMABLE | EMOTION | INCAPACITATION | MAGICAL | MENTAL | MISSIVE |

### Price 250 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate)                   A *captivating score* is a piece of parchment prepared for musical notation, long enough for a short song. You must be trained in Performance to properly compose this missive (or trained in an appropriate Lore skill your GM allows). You choose one of the emotions described below and write a musical composition to convey that emotion about a subject of your choice, typically a person or group. When activated, the missive plays a note‑perfect rendition of the inscribed score. Each creature that can hear the score must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be influenced to feel the emotion you chose toward the subject of your composition. This lasts for 1 hour, typically returning the creature to its initial attitude unless new events have altered their attitude long‑term.

* ### Positive Your song engenders sympathy, adoration, joy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature’s attitude toward the subject improves by one step, such as from indifferent to friendly.
* ### Negative Your song spurs anger, sadness, jealousy, or a similar emotion. An affected creature’s attitude toward the subject worsens by one step, such as from indifferent to unfriendly.

When composing this missive, you can add a small notation or illustration of a type of instrument. If you do, the music sounds like that instrument, and if you didn’t specify, it sounds vaguely like a recorder. The choice of a louder instrument doesn’t make the music carry farther.

### Price 22 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate)                     Composing a *stage fright missive* usually involves creating a scathing review, insulting letter, or embarrassing image that ridicules the recipient. The activating creature must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be overcome with embarrassment for 1 hour, taking a –1 status penalty to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance checks. During this time, if the creature attempts to speak or perform in front of an audience, they become sickened 1. When they recover from this sickened condition, the missive’s effects end. You choose when composing the missive whether it remains as a non‑magical document or burns to ash after imparting its magic.

‌OILS‌‌

## Oils are pretty neat. Obviously all magic can be awesome, and bottled magic that anyone can use without going cross-eyed reading squiggly lines is even cooler, but with oils, you get to play. You gotta get in there with both hands and slather up whatever it is you’re putting them on. I applied anticorrosion oil to some of the boss’s treasures after an ore louse was spotted tunneling in near the vaults, and my nails were beautiful and glossy for a whole week!

A weapon anointed with this oil acts as

bane oil to elementals, but the damage type is the same as the target’s greatest weakness if the target has weakness to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. If it has none of these, the additional damage is the same type as the weapon’s damage type. These effects last 1 minute.

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                               This glistening oil has a green hue and tiny snake scales floating within. If you slather *serpent oil* on a Tiny object that is snakelike in shape, from a stick to a scarf, the object transforms into a viper, keeping some of the same colors and patterns of the original item. If placed on other objects, the oil fails and is wasted. This false snake has the minion trait. It remains in snake form for 1 minute before returning to its object state. If slain, the item returns to its original form, unharmed.           **Type** lesser; **Level** 3; **Price** 8 gp

The oil creates a synergy between skill and weapon, enabling you to wield the weapon in unexpected ways. You must have proficiency with the original weapon to benefit from the oil; however, you use your proficiency rank with the oil’s keyed group instead of the weapon’s original group. Also, you apply the critical specialization effect from the oil’s keyed group instead of the weapon’s normal critical specialization effect. While the oil remains effective, the *grievous* rune and similar magic react as if the weapon belongs to the oil’s group. A weapon can be coated in only one type of *weapon-weird oil* at a time. Any new application of this oil supersedes any previous one. These effects last for 1 hour.

‌POTIONS‌‌

## I’ve always thought potions had worse flavor than alchemical elixirs, but a better mouth feel, you know? Elixirs are more likely to be chunky or oily, and potions tend to be more milky or minty. Not that one, though, that one tastes like beer. And that one over there feels like milk but tastes like nothing. That one? That one tastes like the color pink drunk through an interdimensional straw. You’re going to have to

### Price 5,000 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                           When you drink a *cloning potion*, you split in two, one version of you remaining in your space and the other moving into an

88

‌adjacent space. Your clone, which has the minion trait, looks like you and remains for 1 minute. Provided you are both on the same plane, you can command your clone telepathically with a single action with the concentrate trait. You can also issue verbal commands, as normal for a minion. As an action that has the concentrate trait, you can sense through your clone. When you do, you lose all sensory information from your own body. You can Dismiss this sense-sharing effect.

You and your clone share Hit Points, and the clone uses your statistics. Spells and effects target you and your clone as if you are separate creatures. The clone can Activate your abilities and Cast your Spells, limited by its number of actions, but you share elements such as use limits, frequency, and spell slots. In other words, your clone using one of your resources works as if you did so in or from your clone’s space. Your clone has gear identical to your own, excepting artifacts and consumables. Any item taken from the clone melts into silvery dust within seconds, with ammunition or thrown objects lasting just long enough to travel to and possibly hit their target.

When the duration lapses, your clone melts into silvery dust. You become temporarily immune to *cloning potion* for 1d4 days.

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL POTION

### Price 40 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

When you drink this potion, for 1 round, anything you observe becomes locked into your memory. You can recall the memory perfectly and gain a +2 status bonus to create representations of that memory, whether using Crafting to create an artistic rendition or Society to create a Forgery. The memory remains locked for 1 week or until you benefit from the bonus it imparts for the first time, whichever comes first; afterward, it becomes a normal, fallible memory. You can only have a single memory locked in your mind at a time. Using this potion while you have a locked memory from a previous use makes the previously locked memory fallible but allows you to lock a new memory.

# ELYSIAN DEW ITEM 12

UNCOMMON

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL POTION

### Price 375 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                         When you drink sweet, sky-blue *Elysian dew*, for 1 minute, you gain a 10-foot aura that evokes the vitality of Elysium, causing nearby objects to seem more colorful and plants to stand taller. You and any ally that starts its turn in the emanation gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +1 item bonus to saving throws, and a +1 item bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks until the start of your or the ally’s next turn. If you’re unholy and drink this potion, it fails to work, and you must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or the potion renders you drained 2.

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                               The pale liquid of *empath’s cordial* changes color to reflect the mood of the creature nearest to it—turning blue for calm, red for anger, and green for envious, among other hues. For 1 hour after you drink this potion, you can sense the presence of general emotions, such as hostility toward you or the presence of an emotion effect impacting a creature’s emotions, within 30 feet. A creature that failed a saving throw against *calm* can’t be detected. This potion doesn’t allow you to automatically tell what emotions a specific creature is experiencing, but you can attempt a Perception check with a +2 item bonus (DC set by the GM) to discern that information. The potion also grants you a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive against creatures whose emotions you can sense.

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL POTION REVELATION

### Price 250 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                         A vial of this *enigma-sight potion* seems to contain fragments of kaleidoscopic crystal that reflect mind-bending scenes. However, these “crystals” act like liquid when poured or consumed. Drinking the potion grants you the effects of a *truesight* spell, except that you use your Perception modifier and half your level, rounded up, for the secret counteract check instead of the normal counteract modifier and spell rank. However, if you critically fail the secret counteract check the effect grants, your mind fills in false, nightmarish information. You become stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds and stunned 1 as your brain struggles to process what you see.

After you expel this magical breath, you can’t do so again for 1d4 rounds.

### Critical Success The creature is unaffected.

### Success The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 round.

### Failure The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 minute and slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate)

A foamy, cloudy liquid, *hovering potion* enables you to defy gravity for 5 minutes. By default, the potion causes you to float several inches off the ground. If you take a Stride action, you can move 10 feet up or down in the air. You can instead Climb at your full Speed or Stride to move along a horizontal surface at half your Speed. The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or moved across this way. If you fall while this potion is in effect, you can use the Arrest a Fall reaction as if you had a fly Speed. If you have a fly Speed, you remain airborne at the end of your turn, even if you didn’t use a Fly action this round.

### Price 1,000 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate)

Small bolts of brightly colored electricity flicker through the cloudy *mind-swap potion*. The potion often comes in a double-chambered flask, because when you drink it, you consume half the contents. If another creature of the same ancestry consumes the remainder of the contents within 1 minute, your minds swap per the effect of a critical success on a *mind swap* ritual (*Secrets of Magic* 151). The effects last for 24 hours or until one of you Dismisses the activation.

| --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL | POTION |

### Price 85 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate)

Quenching potion is a clear liquid that tastes like fresh, cool spring water. Drinking this potion or pouring it over yourself completely hydrates you and cleanses your system. Immediately attempt a flat check to end any persistent acid, fire, poison, or void damage affecting you, and attempt a new saving throw against any poison affecting you. Poison can’t progress to a worse stage due to this saving throw. The potion counts as a particularly appropriate type of help against persistent acid, fire, poison, and void damage.

# REBIRTH POTION ITEM 9

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RARE | CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL | POTION |

### Price 150 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                               A small bit from a humanoid—such as a hair, scale, or feather—steeps in the clear liquid of a *rebirth potion*. When the potion is created, this bit determines the ancestry and heritage the potion changes the imbiber to. After you drink the potion, you transform into that ancestry over 8 hours during your next period of rest, finishing the transformation after the 8 hours are up. Throughout this time, you are clumsy 2, enfeebled 2, and stupefied 2. Once the transformation is complete, the potion’s magic ends and can’t be counteracted. Replace your ancestry Hit Points, size, Speeds, attribute boosts, attribute flaws, traits, and special abilities with those of your new ancestry. You lose your ancestry feats, selecting replacements valid for your new ancestry. You have mild control over the change, but you end up with a unique appearance fitting for your new ancestry, and some quirks of your body remain, such as relative age, general health, scars, and missing digits, limbs, or organs.

Drinking a *rebirth potion* of your current ancestry works normally, allowing you to rearrange some of the cited ancestry elements and change your appearance (provided you abide by the potion’s limitations regarding health and age).

Your limb can’t perform actions that require significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. You can’t use it to hold items. At one time, you can have only one extra limb from any version of this potion. Stronger *tentacle potions* replace the effects of weaker ones.

If you have the Flexible Tail or Skillful Tail feats, the Tailed Goblin heritage, or a similar feature the GM believes would benefit, this potion can instead fortify your tail. A fortified tail benefits from any *tentacle potion* as if the potion were the next better type.                               **Type** lesser; **Level** 6; **Price** 33 gp                     **Type** moderate; **Level** 10; **Price** 155 gp

As lesser, but you can use the limb to hold an item of up to light Bulk. You can also use the whole limb to hold onto a suitable anchor point, such as a tree branch, balcony, or rocky outcropping, subject to the GM’s discretion. While using your limb this way, you have free use of all your other limbs, so you can perform tasks that require both hands. This potion lasts 8 hours.                                     **Type** greater; **Level** 14; **Price** 660 gp

As moderate, but the tail can hold an item of up to 1 Bulk or be used as a second hand to help hold an item of up to 2 Bulk. You can also use the limb to make an unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the sweep trait. This potion lasts 24 hours.

‌TALISMANS‌‌

## Talismans are such fun! Haha, this locket makes you forget about that time I made a fool of myself! Hoho, you can’t see me now, can you?! Whiz, zip, pow! My bracelet is filled with throwing stars! DUN DUN DUN! I have all the powers of a dragon unleashed inside my kobold body! And the best part? They also make a bold fashion statement!

  master in the skill you failed with.                   This ornate locket, usually containing a faceless, humanoid portrait, is typically worn on a chain around the neck or attached to your clothing. When activated, the charm casts a DC 26 *rewrite memory* spell against a single target of the check, removing all memory of your failed attempt and potentially allowing you to make another attempt. The effect can’t remove more than 3 minutes of memories from its target.

# BLENDING BROOCH ITEM 11

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | ILLUSION | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |

### Price 275 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

### Activate [free-action] (concentrate) Trigger You roll Stealth for initiative and

  can see a creature; **Requirements** You’re a master in Stealth.   This small, matte-black pin always seems to be on the periphery of your vision, even when you stare directly at it. When you Activate the talisman, choose one creature you can see. You become invisible to that creature unless it succeeds at a DC 28 Will save. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the target hits you with an attack, whichever comes first.

# CAPTIVATING BAUBLE ITEM 12

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Price 350 gp

### Usage affixed to armor; Bulk —

### Activate [three-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Requirements You

  are a master in Deception or Diplomacy.               This talisman appears as an ornate piece of jewelry of the highest quality. When you Activate it, your speech and mannerisms become supernaturally compelling for up to 1 hour. By engaging an intelligent creature in conversation for at least 1 minute, you can cause them to become fascinated unless they succeed at a DC 30 Will save. This fascination lasts for as long as you continue conversing or until you move at least 20 feet away. When the effect ends, the target becomes temporarily

immune for 24 hours. If you or any ally within 120 feet takes an overtly hostile action while a creature is fascinated by the bauble, the bauble burns out in a shower of sparks and all its effects end.

# CHAIN OF STARS ITEM 8

| CONSUMABLE | FORCE | MAGICAL | TALISMAN |

### Price 100 gp

  affixed weapon.                             This delicate dawnsilver chain strung with tiny shuriken is wound tightly around the handle of the affixed weapon. When you Activate the chain, three *+1 striking shuriken* made from magical force materialize in the target’s space and split off to attack other creatures. Attempt up to three shuriken Strikes that must each target a different creature and can’t target the creature you hit to trigger this talisman. These Strikes use your attack modifier but originate from the hit creature’s space. These attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after all three attacks have been made. The shuriken deal force damage instead of their normal type, and each shuriken vanishes after its attack.

# COPPER PENNY ITEM 5

92

‌This decorative shield emblem contains the gilded claw of a dragon mounted in a setting of high-grade adamantine alloy. It protects against a damage type depending on the type of dragon the claw came from (see the sidebar). When you Activate the scutcheon, you and all of your carried, wielded, or worn items gain immunity to all damage of that type until the end of your next turn.‌

If you have a *dragonclaw scutcheon*, *dragonscale cameo*, and *dragontooth trophy* attached to your items, and they all correspond to the same type of dragon, you gain an extra benefit. When you Activate any of these talismans, you gain the ability to cast an 8th-rank, DC 35 *dragon breath* focus spell (*Player Core 2* 263) as an innate spell once before the end of your next turn. Use the dragon type that matches the talismans; you can Cast the Spell this way without spending a Focus Point. Because each talisman disintegrates when used, you can’t get this benefit again until you’ve attached a replacement.

### Craft Requirements Supply one claw from an adult or older dragon.

# DRAGONSCALE CAMEO ITEM 12

When you Activate the trophy, your weapon is momentarily transformed into a magical construct of draconic fury. On the triggering Strike and until the end of your next turn, the damage type of the affixed weapon changes to the type matching the dragon the claw came from (see the sidebar).

others. When you Activate it, you gain a +4 item bonus to your saving throw against the triggering effect. If your result prevents you from being possessed, the creature that attempted to possess you is subject to a DC 37 *seize soul* spell, which can trap it in the talisman as if it had recently died. The talisman’s magic is exhausted after use, but a soul trapped this way remains imprisoned inside, as detailed in the spell description. Starting at the end of its next turn, the trapped creature gets a new save to end the effect at the end of each of its turns.

‌WONDROUS CONSUMABLES‌‌‌

## Bipeds do make such interesting toys. Their lives are so short you’d think they wouldn’t have time for such frippery, yet they produce some of the most unexpectedly whimsical contrivances. Paints that bring the things depicted with them to life. Treats for magical beings whose loyalty need not be bought. Instruments for challenging immortal beings to musical competitions. It’s as though somewhere in the world, any errant thought a human has invariably gets spun into unlikely reality.

# BARGAINER’S INSTRUMENT ITEM 15

RARE CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 1,000 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

**Activate** 1 hour (concentrate, manipulate)               A *bargainer’s instrument* is a musical implement. The most typical version is a violin made from maple and spruce, its body stained so deep a purple it appears almost black. When activated, the instrument casts a *binding circle* ritual to conjure a willing extraplanar talent to compete with you in performance.

The contest could be a musical battle, a dance-off, an oratorical debate—the two of you could even use entirely different types of performance. The loser of the bout is magically bound to perform a task of the winner’s choice within 1 week. The contest consists of taking turns to Perform, starting with your opponent. The Performance check’s DC is the higher of the opponent’s Perception DC or Will DC, though the two parties can mutually agree to use an impartial judge instead. The first to reach four successes wins, with each critical successes counting as two successes. If you play the *bargainer’s instrument* as part of your performance, it grants you a +2 item bonus to the Performance checks.

After the contest, the conjured creature can choose to return to where it came from or remain where you conjured it. The loser must endeavor to complete the task by all reasonable means within 1 week. Failing to complete it is shameful but has no further consequences. The instrument loses its magic and remains a non-magical virtuoso instrument.

SPELLGUNS

The spellgun trait appears on items that can generate a magical effect that flies out like a bullet. You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn’t actually a firearm. You don’t get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can’t load or reload a spellgun, affix talismans to one, attach scopes, affix attached weapons like bayonets or reinforced stocks, and so on.

# BEWILDERING SPELLGUN ITEM 9

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ATTACK | CONSUMABLE | EMOTION | MAGICAL | MENTAL | SPELLGUN |  |

### Price 140 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [two-actions] Strike                             When stared at, a *bewildering spellgun* seems to warp the space around it, creating a mind-bending sensation. Whispers of gibberish arise from it, making their way to nearby ears despite any other sounds in the area. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target’s AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 15 feet. Once fired, the spellgun twists in your hand and melts away.

### Critical Success The target is confused for 1 minute.

### Success The target is confused for 1 minute but can attempt a DC 25 Will save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

# ENERGIZING TREAT ITEM 7

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Price 70 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                           An *energizing treat* is a treat made from meat or grains. When you feed your animal companion or familiar an *energizing treat*, it’s quickened for 1 minute. It can use the extra action each round only for Strike, Stride, and Support actions, and it can do so only if it normally has those actions available and you take the proper action to command it.

# FAMILIAR MORSEL ITEM 5

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Price 30 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                             *Familiar morsels* are little treats that come in a wide variety of flavors that appeal to numerous creatures. Each morsel is keyed to one familiar ability at its creation. When you feed the morsel to your familiar, it gains that familiar ability for 1 hour. If your familiar doesn’t meet the requirements, or if it already has an ability from a *familiar morsel*, the morsel is nothing more than a pleasing snack, its magic wasted.

# ‌MIRACULOUS PAINTBRUSH ITEM 12

UNCOMMON

CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Price 325 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —

**Activate** 10 minutes (concentrate, manipulate)                 The bristles on a *miraculous paintbrush* shift in a rainbow of colors, and can magically create an object painted with them. The paint flows as you Activate the *miraculous paintbrush* and changes color at your whim as you paint. The paint can cover a 10-foot-square, two-dimensional surface. When you’re done painting, attempt a DC 30 Crafting check.

### Critical Success The object you painted emerges from the surface as a real, permanent object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. It’s non-magical and inanimate and has no value except to certain art collectors. If you paint a creature, machine, or form of energy (such as a campfire), these depictions appear only as inanimate sculptures. The created object has a painterly appearance that clearly marks its unusual origin, but is as real as any other.

### Success As critical success, but the object constantly sheds flakes of paint until it falls apart, destroyed, after 24 hours.

### Failure The pigments leave a painting that doesn’t quite look right and doesn’t become an object.

### Critical Failure Is it a dog? Whatever you made is a pretty lousy painting and doesn’t resemble what you set out to make.

# MOONLIT SPELLGUN ITEM 2+

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [two-actions] Strike                           Elegant silver filigree contains the body of this ephemeral item, which is made of solid light. Its shape resembles a pistol, and it’s often carried by hunters of werecreatures and vampires. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target’s AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun emits a silvery ray of pure moonlight that deals fire damage depending on its type. The spellgun’s damage is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

### Critical Success The target takes double damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn. If it has a weakness to silver or a resistance that can be bypassed by silver, it’s also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.

### Success The target takes full damage and is dazzled until the

             start    of    your    next    turn.

### Type minor; Level 2; Price 7 gp

The damage is 1d8 at night, or 1d6 at other times.

  Performance.                                 Made of polished wood, a *neophyte’s fipple* is a block flute enchanted to guarantee melodic sound. When you Perform a song on the fipple to Activate it, your attribute modifier, proficiency bonus, and item bonus for the Performance check total +7, regardless of what they would normally be. Add other bonuses and penalties to the check normally. Once the magic is used, the fipple remains as a mundane instrument.

# POTION PATCH ITEM 4+

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL |

### Usage worn; Bulk —

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate) Requirements You must have the

*potion patch* affixed to your skin.                 A *potion patch* is a sticky, bandage-like pad that can be filled with one potion and affixed to the skin.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UNCOMMON | AUDITORY | CONSUMABLE | MAGICAL | OLFACTORY | VISUAL |  |

### Price 235 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate)                 Plucking a *talespinner’s lyre* while focusing on an event you witnessed causes the instrument to create an illusion in a 50-foot emanation that plays out your memory of the

event in real time, complete with sights, sounds, and smells. You can Sustain the Activation for up to 1 minute to keep it playing. The scene reproduces only what’s in its area, including nothing beyond that even if present in the memory. The scene is realistic, but all observers can clearly tell it’s an illusion. Observers can’t interact with the scene directly nor can they taste or touch elements of it to get a sensation you didn’t personally experience, but they can attempt skill checks to discern more about the scene without altering its contents. For example, no one could see something you didn’t, such as the true form of a creature polymorphed into a squirrel, but an observer might be able to use Perception and Sense Motive to discern the squirrel was acting unlike a squirrel should.

Once the magic is used, the lyre remains as a non-magical virtuoso instrument.

it, the portrait’s eyes follow others more than usual. A creature that succeeds at a DC 30 Perception check notices this phenomenon. The scrying ends after 10 minutes or when you decide to stop watching through the portrait.

The painting loses its magic when the scrying ends, if 4 hours pass after you Activate it without you looking through it, or if you Activate a different *watchful portrait*. The portrait then remains a normal, non-magical work of art, but due to its rather bland subject matter, it is worth no more than 5 gp.

WHELMING SCRIMSHAW                ITEM 13

CONSUMABLE CURSE MAGICAL

### Price 500 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [two-actions] (manipulate)                         An etching of some aquatic beast dragging a figure beneath the waves adorns the ivory of a *whelming scrimshaw*.

CONSUMABLE

AIR AURA

### Price 50 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                           A blue finish decorates the ceramic body of a *wind ocarina*. When you play a note on this ocarina, for 1 minute, winds sweep into strong gusts in a 5-foot emanation around you. The winds have the following effects.

* Ammunition from physical ranged attacks—such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of comparable size—can’t pass through the area. Passing through the area causes attacks with bigger ranged weapons, such as thrown weapons, to take a –2 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths pass through the emanation. Massive ranged weapons and spell effects that don’t create physical objects can pass through the emanation with no penalty.
* The area is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to move through it.
* Gases, including creatures in the form of a vapor, can’t pass through the emanation. When the emanation arises, such gases are removed from the area, including your space.
* The area, including your space, has breathable air.

Once the magic is used, the ocarina remains a non-magical virtuoso musical instrument.
