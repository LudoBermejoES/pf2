[adjusted](#bookmark49) [(armor or shield trait) 8](#bookmark49)

[adjustment](#bookmark54) [(trait) Items with this trait are intended to alter existing pieces of equipment: typically armor, shields, and weapons. The item’s description notes which type of equipment it modifies. An adjustment that modifies armor can modify unarmored defense attire only if specified in its description.

[ammunition](#bookmark181) [42–43 (alchemical), 80–83 (magical)](#bookmark181)

[apex](#bookmark246) [(trait) When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attributes, either increasing the attribute’s modifier by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever would give you a higher value. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don’t gain the](#bookmark246)

[artifacts](#bookmark428) [178–181](#bookmark428)

### attack (trait) An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty.

### auditory (trait) Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can’t hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.

### aura (trait) An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, affecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item.

[backpacks](#bookmark299) [145](#bookmark299)

### backstabber (weapon trait) When you hit an off-guard creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon is a +3 weapon. PC 282

[blighted boons](#bookmark434) [186–189](#bookmark434)

[bomb](#bookmark113) [(trait) An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical components that explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce other effects. 44–45, GMC 244, PC2 283–285](#bookmark113)

[brace](#bookmark70) [(weapon trait) 24](#bookmark70)

### bulwark (armor trait) The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a fireball, you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.

### cantrip (trait) A spell you can cast at will that is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. PC 298

[capacity](#bookmark70) [(weapon trait) 24](#bookmark70)

[catalyst](#bookmark172) [(trait) Items with the catalyst trait are consumables that alter or magnify specific spells. Activating a catalyst is part of casting the spell. The catalyst might increase the number of actions required to cast the spell, as indicated in the catalyst’s Activate entry. Using a catalyst adds the manipulate trait to the spell if it didn’t already have it, and you can draw the catalyst as part of casting the spell. 74–75](#bookmark172)

### clockwork (trait) Clockworks are intricate, complex constructs that can be programmed to perform specific functions. A clockwork creature must be wound regularly to function.

[clothing](#bookmark299) [145–146](#bookmark299)

[coda](#bookmark287) [(trait) Instruments with the coda trait work mostly like staves and have the staff trait. There are two differences: Coda instruments are in the form of musical instruments, and they can be prepared only by bards. Because they’re not physically staves, you can’t attack with a coda instrument, nor can you etch it with weapon runes.](#bookmark287)

[The process of preparing a coda instrument involv](#bookmark287)es [playing significant portions of songs related to the spells within the instrument—either old standards or ones of your own creation. This leaves magical reverberations within the instrument that allow you to complete the songs by playing their coda later in the day. 136](#bookmark287)

### cold (trait) Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures with this trait have a connection to magical cold.

[combination](#bookmark70) [(weapon trait) 24](#bookmark70)

### comfort (armor trait) The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.

[companion](#bookmark251) [(trait) An item with this trait can be worn by an animal companion or similar creature. A companion can have up to two items invested. 106](#bookmark251)

[complex crafting](#bookmark364) [158–159](#bookmark364)

### concealable (weapon trait) This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with this trait.

[concussive](#bookmark70) [(weapon trait) 24](#bookmark70)

[conrasu](#bookmark75) [(weapon trait) A weapon with this trait is created and used by conrasu. 30](#bookmark75)

[consumable](#bookmark202) [(trait) An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, it’s destroyed after activation.

GMC 221](#bookmark202)

[wondrous consumables 96–99](#bookmark202)

[crafting downtime events 159–161](#bookmark365) [critical crafting 161–162](#bookmark366)

[critical crafting](#bookmark366) [161–162](#bookmark366)

[critical fusion](#bookmark70) [(weapon trait) 24](#bookmark70)

### curse (trait) A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. PC 430–431, GMC 306–307

[blighted boons 186–189](#bookmark434)

[cursed items 190–193](#bookmark439)

**deadly** (weapon trait) On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a *greater striking* rune and three dice if the weapon has a *major striking* rune.

### death (trait) An effect with the death trait kills you immediately if it reduces you to 0 HP. Some death effects can bring you closer to death or slay you outright without reducing you to 0 HP. PC 412

[deflecting](#bookmark65) [(shield trait) This shield is designed to block or divert certain types of attacks or weapons. Increase the shield’s Hardness against the listed type of attack by 2. 20](#bookmark65) **disarm** (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm with weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of

a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

### disease (trait) An effect with this trait applies one or more diseases. A disease is typically an affliction. PC 430–431,

GMC 88–89

### divine (trait) This magic comes from the divine tradition, drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything with this trait is magical.

### dwarf (trait) An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.

### electricity (trait) Effects with this trait deal electricity damage. [elixir](#bookmark131) [(trait) Elixirs are alchemical liquids that are used by drinking them. 58–61, PC 293, GMC 246, PC2 286–290](#bookmark131)

[elixirs](#bookmark131) [58–61](#bookmark131)

### emotion (trait) This effect alters a creature’s emotions. Effects with this trait always have the mental trait as well. Creatures with special training or that have mechanical or artificial intelligence are immune to emotion effects.

[entrench](#bookmark49) [(armor trait) 8](#bookmark49)

[expandable](#bookmark128) [(trait) An item with the expandable trait increases to a specific size when activated. Unless otherwise noted, this space must be adjacent to you and on the ground, and the item needs to have enough open space to expand into or else the activation has no effect. When the effect ends, the expanded item disintegrates if it’s a consumable or shrinks back to its normal size if it’s not a consumable. 56](#bookmark128)

### exploration (trait) An activity with this trait takes more than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during exploration mode.

### extradimensional (trait) This effect or item creates an extradimensional space. An extradimensional effect placed inside another extradimensional space ceases to function until it is removed.

[eyepieces](#bookmark301) [146–147](#bookmark301)

### fatal (weapon trait) The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

[fatal aim](#bookmark70) [(weapon trait) 24–25](#bookmark70)

### fear (trait) Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well. finesse (weapon trait) You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when

calculating damage.

### fire (trait) Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a connection to magical fire. [focused](#bookmark302) [(trait) An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn’t count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used.](#bookmark302)

[You can’t gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items. 147–151, GMC 221](#bookmark302)

### foldaway (shield trait) This shield can collapse into a smaller form attached to a gauntlet for stability and easy travel. You can use an Interact action to deploy or stow the shield. While it’s deployed, you can Raise the Shield as long as you have that hand free or are holding an object of light Bulk that’s not a weapon in that hand. The shield impedes the use of your hand while it’s deployed. Though you can still hold items in that hand, you can’t wield weapons in that hand, operate anything that takes two hands, or attack with the gauntlet.

A foldaway shield must be attached to a gauntlet for stability. It can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the shield from a previous gauntlet, if necessary. If the gauntlet is destroyed, the foldaway shield can usually be salvaged. The collapsible nature of the shield makes it impossible to affix an attached weapon to it.

[footwear](#bookmark307) [151](#bookmark307)

### force (trait) Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.

### forceful (weapon trait) This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.

### fortune (trait) A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. PC 401

### free-hand (weapon trait) This weapon doesn’t take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.

[fulu](#bookmark175) [(trait) Fulus are small paper charms that can be affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, a weapon, a creature, or even a structure. Some fulus are composed of multiple such charms, taking effect only once all have been affixed. Each fulu has the fulu and consumable traits, plus a tradition trait—arcane, divine, occult or primal—determined by the magical tradition of its creator. For example, a fulu created by a priest would have the divine trait. Each fulu’s stat block indicates the type of item or creature it can be affixed to. Unless otherwise noted, fulus expire 1 year after being created, reverting to mundane paper.](#bookmark175)

[Some fulus also have the talisman trait. Fulu talismans use the normal rules for Affixing, removing, and activating talismans.](#bookmark175)

[Non-talisman fulus can be affixed or removed easily using the Affix a](#bookmark175) [Fulu activity (page 216).](#bookmark465) [They are activated as soon as they’re affixed. Once a fulu has been activated, it lasts for the given duration and then burns out. Removing a fulu causes it to immediately burn out. The paper is fragile, easily destroyed by hazards such as water, fire, or an observant enemy when unattended or affixed to the ground or a structure. 76–79](#bookmark175)

### general (trait) A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.

[grimoire](#bookmark256) [(trait) Grimoires are magical spellbooks with special abilities. Most can hold up to 100 spells, like any spellbook. If a spellcaster wants to transfer their spells from one of their spellbooks to a grimoire, they can conduct a simple,](#bookmark256)

[like a cleric or wizard, or from a special feat or ability, like the Esoteric Polymath bard feat), you can study a grimoire during your daily preparations to enhance one or more of the spells within. Until your next daily preparations, you gain the ability to Activate the grimoire. As you’ve already absorbed the power from the grimoire during your daily preparations, you can Activate it even if you later lose possession of the book itself. Grimoires’ benefits apply only to spells cast via spell slots—not cantrips, focus spells, or innate spells. No one can use more than one grimoire per day, nor can a grimoire be used by more than one person per day. 110–113](#bookmark256)

### halfling (trait) An item with this trait is created and used by halflings.

### harnessed (shield trait) This shield features a special brace or opening designed to hold lances or other jousting weapons. Jousters often use these shields as a backup in narrow passages and other places where they’re unable to ride a mount. You can Interact to lock a weapon with the jousting trait in place in the shield, enabling you to use two hands to wield the shield and weapon simultaneously. If you’re not wielding the combined unit with both hands, you can use neither the weapon nor the shield.

While you have the shield raised, you can gain the jousting benefit of a weapon as if you were mounted. Because a significant portion of the weapon needs to be braced behind the shield, the weapon’s reach is reduced by 5 feet if it is greater than 5 feet.

[headwear](#bookmark307) [151–153](#bookmark307)

### healing (trait) A healing effect restores a creature’s body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.

### hefty (shield trait) A hefty shield is so heavy that raising it takes more effort. Raising a Shield with the hefty trait is a 2-action activity unless your Strength modifier equals or exceeds the number with the trait.

[held items](#bookmark261) [114–117](#bookmark261)

[hindering](#bookmark49) [(armor trait) 8](#bookmark49)

### hobgoblin (trait) An item with this trait is created and used by hobgoblins.

### holy (trait) Effects with the holy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of benevolence and virtue. They often have stronger effects on unholy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to holy causes and often have weakness to unholy. If a creature with weakness to holy uses a holy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness. PC 36

### illusion (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait involve false sensory stimuli. PC 301

### incapacitation (trait) An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success

level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.

### ingested (trait) This poison is delivered when drunk or eaten.

GMC 248, PC2 291

### inhaled (trait) This poison is delivered when breathed in. GMC 248, PC2 291

[injection](#bookmark108) [(weapon trait) 41](#bookmark108)

GMC 248, PC2 291

[inscribed](#bookmark49) [(equipment trait) 8,](#bookmark49) [20](#bookmark65)

### integrated (shield trait) This shield has been created to include a weapon in its construction, which works like an attached weapon but can’t be removed from the shield. This also prevents other attached weapons from being added to the shield. The integrated weapon’s damage is listed alongside the trait, such as “integrated d6 S,” with any traits in parentheses. Unless otherwise noted in the shield’s description, an integrated weapon is a martial weapon in the shield weapon group and requires one hand to attack with. The attached weapon can have runes etched onto it like other attached weapons. You can continue fighting normally with the integrated weapon if the shield is broken, but if the shield is destroyed, so is the weapon.

[intelligent](#bookmark442) [(trait) An item with the intelligent trait can’t be crafted by normal means—typically an accident, a divine act, or a major sacrifice on the part of the creator is required to grant the item the mental essence it needs for sentience, and in some rare cases the spiritual essence it needs to have a soul of its own. Because of this, intelligent items are always rare or unique. The normal statistics and rules for wearing or using an item of its type still apply to an intelligent item. In addition, intelligent items have some mental abilities, including senses, forms of communication, skills, attributes, and Will saves. intelligent items 193–197](#bookmark442)

### invested (trait) A character can invest only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn’t invested it, nor can it be activated, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off their head).

[kickback](#bookmark72) [(weapon trait) 25](#bookmark72)

[laminar](#bookmark49) [(armor trait) 8](#bookmark49)

### launching (shield trait) A mechanism within this shield can shoot projectiles, causing the shield to also function as a ranged weapon. The trait lists the type of weapon, such as “launching dart.” Striking with the launcher requires the same number of hands as normal, except that the hand holding the shield counts toward this total, so a one-handed ranged weapon would require only one hand. Reloading takes the normal number of Interact actions, to a minimum of 1 action, and you can’t use the hand holding your shield to reload.

### ‌light (trait) Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.

### linguistic (trait) An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.

[lozenge](#bookmark116) [(trait) 46](#bookmark116)

[luck relic aspect](#bookmark450) [199–200](#bookmark450)

### magical (trait) Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.

[magical tattoos](#bookmark267) [118–123](#bookmark267)

[masks](#bookmark310) [154–155](#bookmark310)

### mechanical (trait) A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object.

### mental (trait) A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.

### metal (trait) Effects with the metal trait conjure or manipulate metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a connection to magical metal.

### misfortune (trait) A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. PC 401

[missive](#bookmark186) [(trait) A missive is a piece of magical stationery that must be crafted and composed before it can be activated. All missives have the missive and consumable traits. Missives are often constructed of paper, parchment, or vellum, but any other thin, portable material that can hold writing or embossing upon it can be crafted into missives. After being crafted, the missive is a blank sheet until a message is composed upon it, completing its magic. 84–85](#bookmark186)

[modular](#bookmark72) [(weapon trait) 25](#bookmark72)

### monk (trait) A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks. morph (trait) Spells that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a magical morph effect also gain the magical trait. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described below). Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. For instance, a morph that gave you wings would be dismissed if you polymorphed into a form that had wings of its own (though if your new form lacked wings, you’d keep

the wings from your morph). The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can’t.

[mutagen](#bookmark133) [(trait) An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the subject’s body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects. Mutagens are polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only one at a time. 59–61, PC2 289–290](#bookmark133)

[nature crafting](#bookmark370) [164–169](#bookmark370)

### noisy (armor trait) This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor’s check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you have the required Strength modifier.

### nonlethal (trait) An effect or weapon with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a nonlethal effect or weapon knocks a creature out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.

### occult (trait) This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.

[oil](#bookmark468) [(trait) Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that are typically applied to an object and are used up in the process. 86–87, GMC 257–258, PC2 303](#bookmark468)

### olfactory (trait) An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.

### orc (trait) An item with this trait is created and used by orcs.

### parry (weapon trait) This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

[permanent alchemical items](#bookmark137) [62–65](#bookmark137)

### plant (trait) Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Effects that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.

[poison](#bookmark143) [(trait) An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction. 66–71, PC 430–431, GMC 248](#bookmark143)

[poisons](#bookmark143) [66–71](#bookmark143)

### polymorph (trait) These effects completely transform the target into a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more than one polymorph at a time. If it comes under the effect of another, the second effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.

If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require

activate any items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size, you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.

### prediction (trait) Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future.

### primal (trait) This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.

[processed](#bookmark116) [(trait) 46](#bookmark116)

### propulsive (weapon trait) You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.

[ranged trip](#bookmark73) [(weapon trait) 26](#bookmark73)

### rare (trait) This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. PC 11

[razing](#bookmark73) [(weapon trait) 26](#bookmark73)

### reach (weapon trait) This weapon is long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.

[set relics](#bookmark452) [200–204](#bookmark452)

### shield throw (shield trait) A shield with this trait is designed to be thrown as a ranged attack. When thrown, the shield is a martial thrown ranged weapon. Its damage dice and type are the same as its shield bash attack, but if the shield includes an attached weapon or integrated weapon, you can choose to attack with it instead when you throw the shield.

[specific magic shields 22–23](#bookmark67)

### shove (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

[skeletal](#bookmark49) [(armor specialization) 8](#bookmark49)

### skill (trait) A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype’s dedication feat.

### sleep (trait) This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy.

### sonic (trait) An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.

[spell catalysts](#bookmark172) [74–75](#bookmark172)

[spellgun](#bookmark202) [(trait) The spellgun trait appears on items that can generate a magical effect that flies out like a bullet. You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn’t actually a firearm. You don’t get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can’t load or reload a spellgun, affix talismans to one, attach scopes, affix attached weapons like bayonets or reinforced stocks, and so on. 96](#bookmark202)

[spellheart](#bookmark274) [(trait) Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the Affix a Spellheart activity, which is otherwise identical to Affix a Talisman. The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack modifier or spell DC if it’s higher. Crafting a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. 124–129](#bookmark274)

### splash (trait) Some weapons and effects, such as alchemical bombs, have the splash trait. When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon or effect deals any listed splash damage to the target on a failure, success, or critical success, and to all other creatures within 5 feet of the target on a success or critical success. On a critical failure, the weapon or effect misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial

[staff](#bookmark247) [(trait) This magic item holds spells of a particular theme and allows a spellcaster to cast additional spells by preparing the staff. 103–137, GMC 278–281, PC2 308](#bookmark247)

### sweep (weapon trait) This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a

+1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

[talisman](#bookmark197) [(trait) A talisman is a consumable that must be affixed to an item. 92–95, GMC 263, PC2 305](#bookmark197)

[tattoo](#bookmark267) [(trait) A magical tattoo has the tattoo trait. It’s permanently a part of the subject’s body, and reduces the number of items that creature can invest per day by 1. Each tattoo has the invested trait to indicate this limitation—a magical tattoo is like an invested item that the tattooed creature has no choice but to invest. If the tattoo loses its magic or is destroyed, it no longer reduces your investiture. Just like a physical magic item, a magical tattoo can be counteracted by spells like](#bookmark267) [dispel magic](#bookmark267) [or](#bookmark267) [detonate magic](#bookmark267)[.](#bookmark267)

[If destroyed, the tattoo fades from the skin.](#bookmark267)

[If a creature gets a new magical tattoo when their limit on invested items has already been reduced to zero, the new tattoo’s magic fails to take hold, and it becomes a non-magical tattoo instead. A tattooist can alter an existing tattoo to either remove its magic or to modify it into a different magical tattoo and remove the old effect. Magical tattoos can usually be upgraded into their greater versions by having a tattooist add to or modify the existing tattoo. 118–123](#bookmark267)

### teleportation (trait) Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.

[tethered](#bookmark73) [(weapon trait) 26](#bookmark73)

### thrown (weapon trait) You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown. You add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.

### trip (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using

the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**two-hand** (weapon trait) This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice, such as those from *striking* runes.

### uncommon (trait) Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. PC 11

### unholy (trait) Effects with the unholy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of cruelty and sin. They often have stronger effects on holy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to unholy causes, and often have weakness to holy. If a creature with weakness to unholy uses an unholy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness. PC 36

### unique (trait) A rules element with this trait is one-of-a-kind. PC 11

[Valashinaz](#bookmark7) [4](#bookmark7)

[vehicular](#bookmark73) [(weapon trait) 26](#bookmark73)

### versatile (weapon trait) A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

### virulent (trait) Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction’s stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction’s stage by only 1 instead of by 2.

PC 431, PC2 291

### visual (trait) A visual effect can affect only creatures that can see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.

### vitality (trait) Effects with this trait heal living creatures with energy from the Forge of Creation, deal vitality energy damage to undead, or manipulate vitality energy.

### void (trait) Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with void energy, deal void damage to living creatures, or manipulate void energy.

[wand](#bookmark290) [(trait) A wand contains a single spell which you can cast once per day. 138–143, GMC 282–283, PC2 309](#bookmark290)

### water (trait) Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a connection to magical water.
