‌TRAPPINGS OF POWER‌‌‌‌

## If I’m being totally honest, a lot of stuff in this section is kind of intimidating. These vaults are where the boss keeps a lot of the BIG MAGIC, the stuff that doesn’t run out after you use it. Sure, a few of the things here need to recharge and cool down sometimes, but it’s not like the vaults we just visited where it’s made to poof away

## after one go.

## I don’t have a lot of interest in some of the stuff here. Staves and wands are for wizards, you know? But I do like the patterns and needles in the tattoo vault, and down there toward the end we have vaults just full of cool helmets, gloves, robes, all

## of that stuff. There’s also what I like to call the “knick-knacks vault,” because it’s full of stuff that only works if you’re holding it. There’s an anchor there Ziik had to use when he dropped the boss’s favorite ring down the well. He sunk way down and then came up screaming about tentacles! The boss sealed that well off afterward.

Contained within this chapter’s pages are items and equipment whose magic and effects are intended to serve a character over the course of an entire adventure or even an extended campaign. Robes, staves, wands, grimoires, and much, much more can be found here to ensure your adventurers are fully equipped for whatever trials await them!

This chapter expands upon the existing types of permanent magic items first introduced in *GM Core*, particularly apex items, staves, wands, and worn items. This section also includes expansions to the assistive items presented in *Pathfinder Guns & Gears*, with both expansions of existing prosthetic and mobility aid categories as well as entirely new types of assistive aids. The grimoires, magical tattoos, and spellhearts introduced in *Pathfinder Secrets of Magic* are also expanded upon here.

Among the new assistive items presented in this chapter are a variety of options tailored for companion creatures. Just like in real life, an adventurer’s trusted companion may suffer an injury that would impede their ability to continue exploring the world alongside their master, or a character might choose to adopt a companion who would otherwise struggle with the demands of an adventuring career. These items help ensure that whatever difficulties you face, your animal ally can always be by your side to help you along the way.

Characters who cast spells using Focus Points will also find the Worn Items section particularly helpful, as it includes a variety of new focused items similar to *accolade robe* (*GM Core* 284) but tailored to a wider array of classes and roles.

AM I PLAYING?

Many instruments in this chapter, as well as some presented in Wondrous Consumables [(page 96),](#bookmark201) give you a bonus or effect while you’re playing the instrument, sometimes improving you in ways not directly related to your performance, such as getting a bonus to Perception checks. Usually, the GM can easily determine whether you’re playing the instrument. If you need concrete rules, you’re considered to be playing an instrument as long as you spend at least 1 action each round playing it. This includes playing the instrument for Performance checks, playing it to accompany casting a spell, or just spending a single action to play it. If you just want to play just to keep up the benefit, you can usually take the Perform action for this purpose and forgo your roll.

ASSISTIVE ITEMS

Fantasy gaming is for everyone. It’s incredibly important for all people, regardless of what unique

circumstances they may face in life, to be able to see reflections of themselves inside the world of the game. You

can find assistive items for a variety of disabilities here, in *Player Core*, in *Guns & Gears*, and in *Pathfinder Lost*

Omens Grand Bazaar. Representation in gaming is essential to creating open and welcoming communities, so respectful use of assistive items has a place in all games and stories.

‌APEX ITEMS‌‌

## The pinnacle of magical crafting to some and rightly so. Apex items have the power to transform the weakest human into the strongest, and to raise the mighty above all. Very draconic. Like all fields of creation, crafters and spellforgers continue to refine and personalize the nature and function of apex items to suit the their purposes or the needs of their champions. Accessories become armor, tools become weapons, and for some people, this process happens in reverse. Regardless of the final result, apex items represent the pursuit of ultimate power as expressed through a crafter’s

## crowning achievement.

## —Valashinaz, Mistress of the Vault

When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attributes, either increasing the attribute’s modifier by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever would give you a higher modifier. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture runs out: increasing Intelligence lets you become trained in an additional skill and learn a new language, increasing Constitution gives you more Hit Points, and so on.

An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don’t gain the attribute modifier increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item.

APEX ITEMS

When targeted by a spell or effect with the incapacitation effect, you treat the result of your save as if it were one degree of success better, and the

result of any check made to inflict such an effect on you as one degree of success worse (as if you were more than twice the rank of the spell or effect targeting you).

This doesn’t prevent hostile creatures from attacking you, but it might give you a chance to talk to them before they strike. The dazzling nature of the crown makes it hard for you to read the intentions of others, and you take a –4 status penalty to your Perception DC when someone uses Deception against you.

‌ASSISTIVE ITEMS‌‌‌‌

## This is one of the only rooms in the boss’s vaults that anyone is allowed into. There’s even a checkout chart where anyone in the family can use things when they need them.

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                       Though it appears to be a basic cane, the inner workings of the *wand cane* are an intricate network of lenses and magical circuits, with a slot at the top to insert a wand. The *wand cane* then spends 1 minute attuning to the wand, after which the wand can be used through the cane.

| --- | --- |
| MAGICAL | SONIC |

### Price 950 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                       A specialized *+1 striking thundering probing cane* made from strengthened spruce wood, a *batsbreath cane* is distinctive for its brass tip. The tip covers a small hollow in the wood that houses quartz crystals infused with latent storm magic.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You strike the cane firmly against the ground, causing a pin within the brass tip to tap the crystals and emit a sonic pulse. The pulse reverberates in a 60-foot radius for the next minute, with the cane acting as an antenna to receive the echoes. For 1 minute, as long as you remain in the area and are holding the cane, you gain hearing as a precise sense.

EYES

# MAGICAL PROSTHETIC EYE ITEM 1

MAGICAL

### Price 5 gp

**Usage** worn; **Bulk** L                           This prosthetic eye converts visible light into a telepathic signal that is relayed to the wearer’s mind using magic. As the wearer’s mind must process the telepathic signal in the same way as it would a nerve impulse, the acuity and other abilities related to the vision provided by the *magical prosthetic eye* matches that of other members of your ancestry (for instance, a goblin with a *magical prosthetic eye* would be able to see in darkvision, while a human wearing the same prosthetic would need illumination). You can remove or replace a *magical prosthetic eye* using an Interact action.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you’re wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon’s second range increment from –2 to 0.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate) Frequency once per day; Effect You whisper “spy for me” to the eye, which removes itself from your eye socket and begins to relay its signal to you even at range. Although it can’t move on its own, you can place the eye in a discrete location (using your Stealth DC) to avoid detection. For 10 minutes, you can see what the eye sees as long as you’re within 100 feet of the eye. The eye’s signal can penetrate most barriers but is blocked by lead of any thickness, as well as denser materials. The eye’s signal is visual only.

TAILS

While a simple prosthetic tail can be represented by a basic prosthesis, the below options come with many useful added functions. Using a prosthetic tail effectively generally requires being a member of an ancestry or species that typically has a tail, though creatures from tailless ancestries or species may be able to learn to utilize one under appropriate conditions.

# EXTENDABLE TAIL ITEM 3

MECHANICAL

### Price 10 gp

**Usage** worn; **Bulk** 1                           Built with collapsible poles and expanding hoops, this tail can extend to a length of 20 feet.

‌GRIMOIRES‌‌

## Grimoires. They’re just spellbooks with a little extra magic really, but they’re also ingenious. A spell is a magical structure that you build in your mind, assembling it piece by piece until only the very last little bit is left, waiting for you to seize the power and unleash it by saying the correct phrase and making the correct motions. A grimoire is able to hold a unique piece of a certain type of spell within it indefinitely, allowing you to graft on a piece of magic that might be too complex or specific to be worth holding in your own mind when you join the spell and magic of the grimoire together.

# AMAZING POP-UP BOOK ITEM 11

UNCOMMON GRIMOIRE MAGICAL

### Price 1,250 gp

**Bulk** L                                   Goblin wizards invented the *amazing pop-up book* to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three-dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.

### Activate [free-action] (concentrate, spellshape) Frequency once per day; Effect If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or

creatures, such as *mirage*, you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn’t critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell’s rank.

This room is outfitted with all the accoutrements for a particular type of recreation, determined by you when you cast the spell. Any character who spends at least 1 hour using this recreational facility and then sleeps a full 8 hours inside the location created by the spell is exceptionally well-rested. They regain double the amount of Hit Points they would normally receive for an 8-hour rest, and when they make the next day’s preparations, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks and Will saves for the next 12 hours.

# BOOK OF WARDING PRAYERS ITEM 8

DIVINE GRIMOIRE

### Price 425 gp

**Bulk** L                                     Script in a language of the Outer Planes adorns this book’s spine, and a deity’s symbol is etched on its cover. *Books of warding prayers* are each devoted to a particular deity and are also a religious symbol of that deity.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate, spellshape) Frequency once per day; Effect If your next action is to cast a damage-dealing spell prepared from this grimoire, the spell wreaks even greater destruction. The spell ignores 10 resistance and you reroll any damage dice that roll a 1. If the spell reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, they’re torn apart at an infinitesimal level, not even leaving a fine ash; this is a death effect.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate, spellshape) Frequency once per day; Effect If your next action is to cast a healing spell prepared from this grimoire that restores Hit Points, the spell renews the target constantly and perfectly. The spell

# POP-UPS AND PUREPURIN

Bleh, spellbooks are so boring! What’s so neat about a bunch of squiggly lines that make your head hurt and occasionally cause rats to burst into flames when you read them out loud? (I don’t care what the boss says about my “magical deficiencies,” there’s no way that rat just coincidentally caught fire at the same time I was trying to read a book from her collection of grimoires.)

This book, though? This book is fantastic! There are pictures that pop right up out of the book every time you turn the page! Why don’t more people do this? Don’t they realize how much more fun reading would be if every book had cool little pictures that jumped right up off the page for you? So one or two kobolds lose an eye flipping the pages too fast, I still say it’s worth it to help more people achieve literacy!

—Purepurin

grants the target regeneration 20, restoring 20 Hit Points at the start of its turn and preventing the target both from dying due to damage and from its dying condition increasing to a value that would result in its death. Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it regrows all damaged or ruined organs; it can also regrow any severed body parts as a free action immediately after the body part is severed, with the original crumbling to ash. The effect lasts for 4 rounds.

# COMMUNION MAT ITEM 14

GRIMOIRE MAGICAL

### Price 3,750 gp

When you first invest the grimoire, you and your familiar each press a limb to a corner of the mat. The ritual circle then morphs to one matching the tradition of your patron, the spells contained in your familiar appearing in the margins. During your daily preparations, your familiar performs a small jaunt around the open ritual circle to strengthen its connection to your patron.

### Activate [free-action] (concentrate, spellshape) Frequency once per 10 minutes; Effect If your next action is to cast a spell your familiar learned from a lesson (whether a cantrip or from a spell slot), your patron notices that you’re putting their power to good use and strengthens your familiar with a surge of magic. Your familiar Sustains one of your spells.

| GRIMOIRE | MAGICAL |

### Price 90 gp

**Bulk** L                                   This tiny recipe book was created by a famous draxie chef, but it instantly resizes to fit the hand and eyes of the reader. While most of the pages are blank and ready to receive spells, the first four pages are taken up by a complex seasoning recipe that requires a casting of *revealing light*.

**Activate** [free-action] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** If your next action is to cast a *revealing light* spell, all creatures within the spell’s area who don’t critically succeed at their save are covered with a spicy red powder. Any attempt to grab or grapple a creature affected in this way, or to swallow such a creature whole, gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the attempt, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the attempt is made using a jaws or similar mouth-based attack, due to the target’s extra deliciousness and savory smell. An affected creature can remove the powder by thoroughly cleaning themselves (a process that typically takes about 10 minutes) or by completely immersing themselves in water.

# A LOQUACIOUS KOBOLD

It’s no pop-up book, but this dictionary over here? The boss made me bring it with us on a trip to this place called “Jalma Ray” when she was looking to trade some old prayer scrolls for a journal some monks had procured by a guy named “Gub.” Gib? Gab. Something like that. I guess he used to be a big deal but now he runs zombie farms or something, I honestly wasn’t paying that much attention. The point is, the boss used the book to cast a spell that let her speak to the monks, and their entire language appeared in here! Even once the magic wore off I was able to help translate between the boss and the monks. The boss even let me hold onto the book for a bit after we got back, and now I can read Vudrani! I think I can probably speak it too, but I’ve never really tried it out. Reading and speaking aren’t that different though, right?

## Everything in this vault does neat stuff as long as you’re holding it. Ziik does this hilarious impression of the boss using that smoking pipe over there. He’s all “RARGH!

Instead, when you enter a body of water, you sink to the bottom at a rate of 25 feet per round and can move across the bottom at your normal Speed. You’re protected from environmental effects of deep water such as pressure, cold temperatures, and any negative consequences of depressurization.

**Activate** 1 minute (manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You’re underwater; **Effect** You spend one minute digging the anchor into the seabed, after which the anchor casts a *cozy cabin* spell, summoning a sunken ship instead of a cabin. The sunken ship is filled with breathable air.

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                     This small cube has smooth matte sides. One side is black, the opposite side is white, and the other four are various shades of gray. Each side can be attuned to a location and then teleport you back to that spot in the blink of an eye.

### Activate 10 minutes (concentrate, manipulate) Effect Pick one side of the cube and set it face up. You attune the cube to the location you currently occupy. Each side can be attuned to only one location. Once you use this action to attune to a location, the side you pick loses any previously attuned location.

### Activate [three-actions] (concentrate, manipulate, teleportation) Effect While speaking a word of command and bringing the location into your mind, you push the corresponding side of the cube. You teleport to the location attuned to the side you press, within 100 feet of the attuned location, as long as that location is on the same planet.

While it may seem nothing more than a curiosity, it’s a powerful agent of fortune when activated.

114

‌**Activate** [reaction] (manipulate) **Trigger** You fail a check or attack; **Effect** Flip the coin. If it lands on the seraph side, you get a 12 on the die instead of what you rolled. If it lands on the fiend side, one of the eyes on the fiend closes. Either way, you’re temporarily immune to *fortune’s coin* for 1 hour. When all seven eyes are closed, the coin vanishes into a puff of smoke, disappearing forever. This activation is a‌

  fortune effect, regardless of how the coin flip lands.       **Type** *fortune’s coin*; **Level** 8; **Price** 450 gp             **Type** *platinum fortune’s coin*; **Level** 14; **Price** 4,000 gp

| LIGHT | MAGICAL |

### Price 1,850 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                     Crafted from cold iron, this black hooded lantern has gray glass and lenses that emit a pale gray light when the lantern is lit. Anything this light falls on looks gray or desaturated. The lantern uses oil as a standard hooded lantern. The lantern’s light shines within the Ethereal Plane as well as the Universe. On any other plane, the light functions as a normal hooded lantern.

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** The lantern’s shutters are open; **Effect** You concentrate on the lantern’s light to soften the boundary between the Ethereal Plane and the Universe. Any creature in the lantern’s bright light on the Universe gains the effects of the *ghost touch* property rune on all its weapons and unarmed attacks. If an affected weapon or attack is magical and already has the maximum number of property runes, the wielder can choose one to suppress to gain *ghost touch*. This benefit lasts for 5 minutes or until the shutters are closed, whichever comes first. It applies to a creature only while it’s in the lantern’s bright light, and if the creature leaves the light and returns it regains the benefit once more.

# HORRID FIGURINE ITEM 8

MAGICAL

### Price 450 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L                     Carved in a putrid jade, the color of disease, this figurine is a bloated humanoid mass of writhing vermin and serpents, all rendered in disgusting detail. The creeping pattern is carved so they seem to move and contort the more one views the figurine. When activated, the effect is amplified to a disgusting or horrifying degree. The figurine can be activated twice per day. If you try to activate it a third time during a day, it dissolves into a puddle of non-magical, putrid glue, causing you to become sickened 3.

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Effect Holding the figurine over your head and speaking one command word causes a wave of nausea in a 20-foot emanation. Each creature in the emanation must succeed at a DC 24

Fortitude save or become sickened 2. You’re immune to this effect.

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Effect Holding the figurine over your head and speaking a different command word causes those around to tremble in fear. Each creature in a 20-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or become frightened 3. You’re immune to this effect.

# JUG OF FOND REMEMBRANCE ITEM 4

MAGICAL

### Price 75 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —

This large jug always seems to contain just enough of the holder’s favorite alcohol to share with a friend. As long as you’re holding the jug, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks. If you share a sip of the liquor from the jug with a creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next Diplomacy check to Make an Impression or Request something from that creature any time within the next month.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You take a long swig on the jug and then Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.

# LEGERDEMAIN HANDKERCHIEF ITEM 2

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| EXTRADIMENSIONAL | MAGICAL |

### Price 25 gp

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —

This frilled, silvery-gray handkerchief is a stylish tool for personal hygiene by all appearances, but it can be used to covertly make very small items vanish.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Requirements The handkerchief is entirely covering an item of negligible Bulk; Effect The handkerchief transports the item it covers into its extradimensional space. The handkerchief can hold only one item within its extradimensional space at a time, so any item taken is replaced by any item already within the space. You can also use this action to expel an item already within the extradimensional space without replacing it. This activation can’t be used on an attended item unless the creature with that item allows it. Placing the handkerchief over an item typically takes an Interact action.

# PLANAR TUNNEL ITEM 15

### Price 6,000 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

‌If another extradimensional space is opened inside the *planar tunnel*, rather than deactivating either item as typical for extradimensional spaces, a rift to the keyed plane tears open and destroys both items. Any creature or unattended object in the *planar tunnel* is instantly transported to the keyed plane, though a creature can avoid this by succeeding at a DC 30 Reflex save.

### Activate [three-actions] (manipulate) You open the collapsed mechanism to fully open the tunnel, revealing an extradimensional space that stays in place. The tunnel is 6 feet across—just big enough to cover a 5-foot square—and 10 feet deep. The passage’s depth is perpendicular to the surface, so it’s most commonly placed on a floor to make a hole straight down or on a wall to create a horizontal passage through it. The atmosphere is hospitable to travel even if the keyed plane wouldn’t be.

Anyone adjacent to either edge of the tunnel can Interact to collapse the opening. This closes both entrances to the extradimensional space. Any objects or creatures within the tunnel remain inside, and any that can’t fit fully inside are ejected into the nearest open space. No matter how many items are in the *planar tunnel*, its Bulk never changes. Items can be stowed or retrieved only while the tunnel is fully open. When the tunnel is closed, the interior remains a stable environment for 10 minutes, after which any creature or object inside is subjected to the environment of the keyed plane as it seeps through the boundary. A living creature placed inside can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inside the tunnel provides no benefits unless it’s retrieved first. Anything in the tunnel can’t be detected by magic that detects only things on the same plane.

**Special** A *planar tunnel* can be used as a planar key for the *interplanar teleport* spell, and has the same rarity as the key, as specified in the spell.

# SEXTANT OF THE NIGHT ITEM 4

MAGICAL

### Price 95 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1                     This finely wrought sextant is made from silver with several onyx mirrors and shades made from thin sets of crystal glass. A fine spyglass made of silver is affixed to the frame; removing the spyglass destroys the sextant. By all appearances, the sextant shouldn’t function, as the shades and mirrors are swapped, but when you look through the spyglass, you see a night sky during the day and the sun during the night, as if day and night were inverted.

When you use the sextant, you gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks, which increases to a +2 item bonus when you Sense Direction.

STANDARD OF THE PRIMEVAL HOWL      ITEM 10

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| MAGICAL | MENTAL |

### Price 900 gp

Usage    held    in    1    hand;    Bulk    1

These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beast—a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20-foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks. **Activate** [reaction] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger**

An ally within 20 feet of you critically hits with a Strike; **Requirements** You have the Battle Cry skill feat; **Effect** You attempt to Demoralize the foe the Strike hit.

# VAPOROUS PIPE ITEM 7

MAGICAL

### Price 340 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** —                       This hand-polished pipe is carved from oak and releases small wisps of smoke even when unlit. As long as you’re holding a *vaporous pipe*, you don’t take a circumstance penalty to Perception checks due to thick smoke, and you can’t suffocate from smoke and heated air (such as within a wildfire). As long as you are holding the pipe, you also gain resistance to fire equal to half your level.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You draw on the pipe and then blow a massive cloud of smoke that fills a 30-foot emanation that includes your space. All creatures within the smoke cloud are concealed from each other and from creatures outside the smoke, though you can still see clearly within it. The smoke dissipates after 3 rounds, or after 1 round if subjected to a strong wind.

# VIOLIN OF THE WAVES ITEM 9

UNCOMMON AUDITORY MAGICAL

### Price 700 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1

This violin is crafted from finely wrought rosewood that emits a strong, but pleasant, smell of salt water and ocean life. It’s engraved with images of sailors working and waves gently rolling. When you make a Performance check using the *violin of the waves*, you gain a +2 item bonus to the check. This bonus increases to +3 if the performer is currently aboard a ship, walking on the ocean, or otherwise immediately adjacent to ocean water.

The violin was created to play a specific tune, one that springs instantly into the mind of anyone who so much as casually strums the instrument. It’s a tune of calm waters and safety, but also of pranks played upon shipmates and revelry. **Activate** 5 minutes (manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Requirements** You must be aboard a ship; **Effect** You play the song. Once it’s completed, the weather immediately calms to the normal as it would for the season, as *control weather*. For the next day, the weather remains in this state, unless affected by other magical effects. Anyone aboard the ship finds their mind wanders when performing tasks however, daydreaming of drunken revelry or other forms

# VOICE FROM THE GRAVE ITEM 10

### Price 1,700 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                     This onyx skull emits eerie whispers when on its own, but when held the skull enables you to speak with spirits and haunts you can see, even if you don’t share a language. The *voice from the grave* translates anything the spirit or haunt says, using a language you understand, and translates your words for the spirit or haunt in kind. This doesn’t make the target friendly or even cooperative, but it does enable communication. The GM determines the language in the case of a haunt. You can’t communicate with mindless spirits using the skull.

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The onyx skull casts a DC 27 *charm* spell on one spirit or haunt you can communicate with using the skull. If you target a haunt that doesn’t have a Will modifier, it automatically gets a failure on its save.

# WIND AT YOUR BACK ITEM 5

AIR MAGICAL

### Price 130 gp

### Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

This object can only be described as a gray, solidified, miniature cloud that feels spongy to the touch. The cloud is incredibly soft and can be easily lifted with little effort, though its ephemeral nature requires using two hands to ensure it doesn’t slip from your grasp.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per day; Effect You blow across the surface of the cloud, and it floats free of you and calls up a strong breeze. For the next 8 hours, it floats behind you and your companions, increasing the amount of time the group can Hustle during exploration to the lowest Constitution modifier in the group × 20 instead of × 10. You must all remain within 100 feet to get the benefit.

If you activate the item aboard a vehicle, you instead grant the vehicle a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speeds for 8 hours. If the vehicle is powered by wind, such as a sailing ship, the bonus increases to +20 feet.

When the 8 hours are up, the cloud stops blowing and floats back into your hands.

‌MAGICAL TATTOOS‌‌‌

## Tattoos mark you permanently, weighty in meaning and created through artistry and pain. It’s a tradition worthy of a dragon, really, paying bloody tribute to your own glory. A testament that will stand as long as you do. The least draconic thing about it is how reliant the bearer of the tattoo is on someone else to apply it properly. Hmmm… I expect Purepurin would be quite pleased that I even briefly considered the similarities between her and a tattoo artist, each responsible for enshrining their

## patron’s glory. Best if we don’t give her any ideas...

**Usage** tattooed on the body; **Bulk** —                   Geometric precision and perfect angles signify that an artist with exemplary knowledge of dwarven tattooing traditions created this body art.

A need for freedom trills through your ally’s blood. Until the end of that ally’s next turn, they gain a +2 status bonus to rolls to recover from the confused, frightened, grabbed, paralyzed, and restrained conditions.

Once on their next turn, the ally can attempt to draw a creature’s attention. To do so, the ally must spend 1 action (which has the emotion, mental, and visual traits) to select a creature the ally can see and make eye contact in a way the target can see. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be fascinated with your ally until the end of that ally’s next turn. If the save succeeds or the effect ends, the target is temporarily immune to being fascinated by any *magnolia* *bewitching bloom* for 24 hours.                     **Type** purple iris; **Level** 11; **Price** 1,200 gp

Your ally takes on a regal bearing, exuding the presence of confident royalty. The bloom casts a 5th-rank *command* spell (DC 28) selecting targets within range of the ally.

A *memoir map* starts with an icon representing your location when you receive the tattoo, usually over the heart, and grows

‌from there. Traveling to another plane causes a new portion to appear on a different part of your body to represent that plane. If you want a record of your life before you receive your *memoir map*, you can have the tattoo artist embellish the map to represent past events.‌

# MORTAL CHRONICLE ITEM 1

INVESTED MAGICAL TATTOO

### Price 10 gp

### Usage tattooed on the body; Bulk —

Common among fatalists and adventurers with access to resurrection magic, *mortal chronicles* look like tombstones, funeral plaques, or simple scrolls bearing the wearer’s name or nickname. If you die, the date and cause of your death appear on the tattoo. The cause is literal and inexact, failing to identify specifics; it could read “beheaded” or “immolated” but not “beheaded by Amiri” or “murdered with fire.” If you’re raised from the dead, a mark on the tattoo indicates the date you reversed your death. The tattoo then expands enough to list your next death when it comes.

# THIS ONE WOULD LOOK GREAT ON ME

I’ve always thought I’d look great with a tattoo, don’tchya think? And if you’re going to get a tattoo anyways, it might as well be magic, right? I was thinking I could get a big tattoo of a cave bear on my back that lets me turn into a cave bear. Nobody messes with cave bears. You walk into a cave and see a cave bear, it’s all “Don’t mind me, Mr. Bear, I took a wrong turn, see you later,” you know. Ooh, or I could get a tattoo of the boss on my bicep, maybe?

**Usage** tattooed on the body; **Bulk** —                 This tattoo usually depicts a humanoid skull with staring eyes in its sockets, but any creature with two eyes and a skull is possible, such as a wolf, phoenix, or psychopomp.

If a death effect would kill you—provided the effect is from a creature of 8th level or lower or a spell of 4th rank or lower—this tattoo activates and keeps you alive instead. You can benefit from this ability only once per day. Each time the tattoo prevents you from dying, one of its eyes disappears, the image now featuring either an empty socket or an eyepatch or other covering. After both eyes vanish, the tattoo becomes non-magical and no longer protects you. If you receive a new *staring skull* tattoo, any other you have loses its staring eyes and becomes non-magical.

‌SPELLHEARTS‌‌

## Okay, these things are amazing. Remember the talismans I showed you earlier? They’re like those, except they don’t burn out after you use them once, and they do other things depending on what you attach them to. This one makes you really good at picking locks if you attach it to your armor, but don’t fall asleep wearing it or you’ll have some weird dreams. That one summons animals and shares their attributes with you based on how you use it. That one makes flowers!

    # FIDDLY TRINKETS

    I honestly don’t know what to make of these little trinkets the bipeds call “spellhearts.” They’re rather ingenious, combining the simple magic of talismans with the more complex and enduring spellforms typically used in wands—and without requiring innate magical skill from the user.

    I learned how to craft them from an elven monk who used them to amplify and diversify the effects he could achieve by controlling his chi. He’d always wear one pinned to his gi and another tucked into his handwraps. That spellheart scarf over there was a gift he gave me after our last treasure-hunting excursion into the Valashmai Jungle together, back before the Sri-Valash Raj rose to power. I haven’t seen him in at least a century. I expect he’s gone now, but not entirely, so long as his history is preserved within these vaults.

‌STAVES‌‌

## Ah, the magic staff, that most iconic tool of the mortal spellcaster. As essential to a wizard as a sword to a warrior or lockpicks to a thief, staves can store power, grant knowledge of spells, and allow a spellcaster to exceed the limitations of their own mind in a variety of ways. The difference between the winner and loser in a war of archmages often comes down to who held the better implement of power. Pity they’re so often made out of sticks instead of something more durable and interesting.

‌Coda Instruments‌

While many spellcasters prefer standard magic staves, bards often quest to find or create magical instruments to help supplement their songs. Instruments with the coda trait work mostly like staves, and have the staff trait. There are two differences: Coda instruments are in the form of musical instruments, and they can be prepared only by bards. Because they’re not physically staves, you can’t attack with a coda instrument nor can you etch it with weapon runes.

The process of preparing a coda instrument involves playing significant portions of songs related to the spells within the instrument—either old standards or ones of your own creation. This leaves magical reverberations within the instrument that allow you to complete the songs by playing their coda later in the day.

‌WANDS‌‌

## Wands are often seen as magical storage—a place for a wizard to tuck away a spare spell they might not use as often. But they have the potential to be so much more. Like a magical catalyst, a wand can change the very nature of a spell, adding effects and functionality beyond what the basic spellform is capable of. Though as I’ve noted before, duels of archmages are often decided by who runs out of spells first, so

## even the wand’s most basic function of spell storage should not be discounted.

‌WORN ITEMS‌‌‌

## Gotta love this section. Bandoliers, clothing runes, magical backpacks, that one really angry helmet over there... I think the biggest downside to this room is that outside of “experiment days” I don’t really get to play with, errrr, test the collection out as much. Most of the stuff has to be “invested” so you can’t try out the really special functions of more than ten or so of them in a day before the magic gets all weird and you can’t connect with the deeper magics of any more invested items until the next day. Or something like that. The boss explained it to me once when I couldn’t get magic beams to come out of a helmet I was wearing, but it was kind of hard to hear

## the details because my ears were covered.

## —Purepurin

Accessory Runes

Accessory runes are runes that provide enhancements or abilities to mundane clothing, items, shields, and vehicles. When you inscribe an item with an accessory rune, it gains the invested trait, requiring you to invest the item to gain its magical benefits. An item that already has the invested trait can never have an accessory rune inscribed on it, and consequently an item can never have more than one accessory rune.

Each accessory rune can be applied to a specific type of item, as indicated in the Usage entry of the rune’s stat block. You can etch an accessory rune onto any mundane item that meets these criteria. If allowed by the Usage entry, you can even apply an accessory rune to a magic item that doesn’t already have the invested trait, such as a shield.

Accessory runes must be physically applied to items through a special process to convey their effects, like all runes. Etching an accessory rune follows the same rules for formulas, etching, and transferring runes as fundamental and property runes (*GM Core* 225) with the following exception: because accessory runes are applied to materials that are less sturdy than metal or wood, they can’t always be etched into that surface. When transferring runes to a cloth or other soft surface, the rune can be stitched, sewn, patched, or embossed onto the material being used. Regardless of the surface’s form, use the same rules as you would for etching a rune. When transferring runes from cloth onto a runestone, the rune magically appears on the stone as you cut, unravel, or scrape the rune from the cloth surface.

The level of an item with an accessory rune applied to it is equal to the highest level between the base item and the rune applied to it, as typical for runes. However, if an item’s level increases from its accessory rune, it doesn’t increase any of the values used to determine the item’s other abilities. For example, an item with activations or abilities that attempt counteract checks

continues to use the item’s original level, not the accessory rune’s level, to determine its counteract rank.
