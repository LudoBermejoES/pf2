‌GAME MASTER’S TROVE‌‌

## Some objects are simply too powerful for the average mortal to handle. Concepts that bend the very fabric of reality, weapons belonging to the gods themselves, instruments whose wills are stronger than that of most musicians… Such things must be handled with care and intent. Purepurin and her kin are not allowed into these vaults. She is earnest and more skilled than she seems, but the treasures that lie beyond this point are simply too much for her. So go, mortal. Walk where even dragons move with care. Uncover the old magics and that which the gods themselves have blessed.

## And if you return, perhaps the day will come when we seek even more secrets, together.

Secrets of Crafting

This chapter includes options that are targeted toward GMs more than players. While players are sure to find fun and excitement in the artifacts, archetypes, boons, and other options presented here, these options all require some degree of GM planning and execution and should not simply be assumed to be available to players joining a new game.

The Artifacts section of this chapter expands the artifacts first presented in *Pathfinder GM Core*, with new options expanding the level, theme, and functions available for such items. Artifacts are almost universally powerful and rare. They should be introduced into an adventure as part of a major plot point, either as a reward for the completion of an epic quest or as a tool to help the players complete such an endeavor.

The Archetype Artifacts section presents a new type of archetype, one accessed via bonding with a magical artifact that can grow with the character. Granting archetype artifacts as options in a campaign using the free archetype variant rules is the assumed function of these options, but having a character’s very identity be subsumed by an artifact they have bonded to presents its own interesting and unique roleplaying opportunities. Blighted Boons introduces a new type of consumable, unique to this section. Blighted boons are consumables that can grant great power, but at a terrible price. These items are intended to be the core of a major story the PCs play through. They often put a countdown on the character who uses them, driving that person to use the power to complete a quest and purge the item from their bodies before it consumes them utterly, resulting in their death and destruction. These can be great tools for telling stories of heroes who accept a dreadful doom in exchange for the power to right some horrible wrong or can help add urgency to a campaign where the timeline

might not otherwise demand much of the PCs.

Intelligent and Cursed Items expand the options for intelligent and cursed items first introduced in *GM Core*. These items can be used as allies, foils, or even nemeses of the PCs, or simply as fun and quirky story hooks that add texture and flavor to the campaign world.

Relics are another addition to the options from *GM Core*, vastly expanding the aspects, gifts, and seeds already available. This section also introduces a new type of relic configuration in the form of item sets. Rather than a single relic whose power grows with the character, item sets are collections of themed items that players can seek out, increasing the power and functionality of the collective ensemble with each added item. Not only can these item sets serve as a fun way to emphasize the flavor of a given character, they can also help you decide what kind of treasure you might want to include in your encounters.

STORIES AND POWER

Many of the items presented in this section offer great power to the character who uses them, often at a price. The price for this power is a tool that you, as the Game Master, can

use to create dramatic tension and high stakes in your stories. Artifacts, boons, and cursed or intelligent items should always be used to advance the stories you tell in your campaigns and create deeper connections between the players and the setting. Work with

your players to discuss ways that these rare and potent items might help tell an exciting and otherwise impossible story.

‌ARTIFACTS‌‌‌‌

## To speak of artifacts as though you have any insight into them beyond the most superficial level is to indicate that you do not actually understand them. Artifacts by their very nature are unique, created by a convergence of circumstances, events, and raw power that is often impossible to replicate and which may not lead to the same result, if even perfectly reconstructed. Within artifacts live the very essence of deities, archmages, dragons, angels, and whatever other forces deign to separate the

## totality of their self between living and unliving vessels.

Cayden’s Tankard

Cayden Cailean entered the Starstone Cathedral with tankard in hand and emerged holding that same tankard, never spilling a drop of drink. The Accidental God wasn’t the only one who achieved apotheosis over his 3-day test—that ordinary tankard became a powerful artifact, and he’s kept it with him ever since. Though Cayden usually relies on his rapier, the tankard serves the same function it did during mortal tavern brawls, just more effectively.

# CAYDEN’S TANKARD ITEM 25

UNIQUE ARTIFACT DIVINE

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                             This ordinary-looking silver tankard functions as a *+4 major striking returning shockwave light hammer* when wielded as a weapon. Imbued with Cayden Cailean’s courage, you are immune to fear effects. Any liquid poured into the tankard transforms into a strong, alcoholic ambrosia that remains contained safely within until you drink it. Drinking the ambrosia Activates the tankard, with one of the following effects. If you aren’t the one blessed to borrow the tankard, you are drained 4 and enfeebled 4 while holding it, and its magic doesn’t function for you.

### Activate [reaction] (manipulate) Trigger You are targeted or included in the area of a fear effect; Effect Calmly swigging a drink on the battlefield turns your foe’s attempt to frighten you against them. The fear effect is counteracted for all targets, and the creature that created the effect must attempt a saving throw as if it alone were the original target of the effect.

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Frequency once per hour; Effect You drink from the tankard, ending the controlled, grabbed, immobilized, paralyzed, restrained, and slowed conditions on yourself and creatures of your choice within 120 feet of you, as well as anything giving such targets a circumstance penalty to Speed. Any effect causing these conditions ends, and if the source of the effect is an item, that item can’t produce the effect for 1 week, provided it is of a level lower than the tankard’s. If a target needs to Escape an effect imposing any of these conditions, it automatically does so on its next attempt. You can Activate this ability even if one of the listed conditions would normally prevent you from doing so (such as paralyzed).

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Frequency once per day; Effect You enhance yourself with a shard of Cayden’s

  divine fortune and cast *indestructibility*.                 **Destruction** If an unholy creature carries *Cayden’s Tankard* into the Starstone Cathedral, drinks from it, and returns outside with it, the tankard shatters.

Coldstar Pistols

As one of Arcadia’s legendary star gun–wielders, the man called Deft Onki, once roamed the territory of the Illani Plains. A terror to some and a hero to others, Onki had a reputation as a consummate trickster, as likely to cheat those he encountered as aid them.

Deft Onki’s *Coldstar Pistols* are actually a set of siccatite dueling handguns that can fuse together to form one weapon. Onki threw his opponents off balance by switching between the double-barreled form and wielding a pistol in each hand. The final tale in Deft Onki’s cycle states that when he grew old, he buried his *Coldstar Pistols* somewhere in the Crownpeaks along with a vast store of treasure, bequeathing his legacy to the one clever enough to find it.

COLDSTAR PISTOLS                    ITEM 23

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UNIQUE | ARTIFACT | MAGICAL |

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1                       One dueling pistol in this paired set is etched with flames along its barrel, while the other is etched with icicles. In these separate forms, one gun comprising the *Coldstar Pistols* functions as a *+3 greater striking greater flaming dueling pistol*G&G and the other as a *+3 greater striking greater frost dueling pistol*. When joined, the guns form a double-barreled weapon that functions as a *+4 major striking greater flaming greater frost dueling pistol*. The combined form has a range increment of 120 feet. In either form, the *Coldstar Pistols* have the agile, concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. As star guns, the *Coldstar Pistols* run on magic and don’t use ammunition or black powder.

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate) **Effect** You switch the *Coldstar Pistols* from one form to the other. Attempt a Deception check to Feint with a +4 circumstance bonus.

### ‌Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Frequency once per round; Effect Make two Strikes against one target, taking the highest of the two attack rolls and applying it to both attacks. Your‌‌‌

anything, and this feature, along with her legendary stealth,

earned her the moniker Ghosthand.                Like most fabled star guns, *Ghosthand’s Comet* has

  multiple attack penalty increases only after these Strikes.   **Destruction** If Deft Onki’s name and deeds ever fade from mortal memory entirely, the *Coldstar Pistols* can be destroyed like a normal object.

Forgotten Signet

In his isolated Crumbling Tower in the First World, the mysterious Lost Prince broods, rarely speaking to even his most loyal followers. Over the millennia, the Lost Prince has gifted several rings from his own hand to mortals who catch his attention. The prince is careful in his selection of recipients; although the powers of a *forgotten signet* is formidable, few people are prepared for the isolation the ring can bring. The Prince makes little effort to reclaim lost rings, knowing they’ll find those who need them.

# FORGOTTEN SIGNET ITEM 21

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RARE | ARTIFACT | INVESTED | MAGICAL |

**Usage** worn; **Bulk** —                               At the center of this silver ring gleams an obsidian gem, its surface emblazoned with a blood-red rune of forgetting. While wearing a *forgotten signet*, you’re subjected to *hidden mind* (+32 counteract bonus) and easily fade from others’ memory. Sapient creatures must attempt a DC 42 Will save each time you depart from their company or they forget you entirely.

### Critical Success The creature’s memories of you are normal.

### Success The creature remembers you and your interactions but has difficulty describing either to others. Each time they attempt to share information about these subjects with someone else, they relate only confusing or unclear details about you and this interaction.

### Failure The creature remembers your existence but no details about you or your interactions. For example, they remember speaking with an individual of your most basic biological traits, such as a human woman, but not your name, appearance, or other specific features.

### Critical Failure The creature retains no memories of you or

  this interaction.                             **Destruction** If a creature learns the true name of a *forgotten signet*’s wearer and makes it public knowledge, that *forgotten signet* tarnishes and breaks in two.

Ghosthand’s Comet

Millennia after her death, the name of Ghosthand Xotlana is still revered in Arcadia’s Deadshot Land of Tazuni, with tales of her exploits often swapped around campfires. Once a drifter cast from her home—though stories vary as to why—Xotlana gained a reputation as a bandit hunter. One story tells of her, alone, picking off 50 ruffians in a single night. Upon journeying to the Crownpeaks, Xotlana earned the Crowned Regents’ respect with her talent. The regents granted Xotlana a star gun crafted of inubrix and bloodwood. It’s said the weapon could shoot through

long since vanished. Legend says that Xotlana lost a duel with the Grim Reaper amid Tazuni’s deserts. The story continues, saying the one to find the weapon will be able to commune with Ghosthand Xotlana and channel her spirit.

# GHOSTHAND’S COMET ITEM 23

UNIQUE ARTIFACT MAGICAL

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 2                     The barrel of this long rifle is translucent in places, forming a swirled pattern along the metal, and its stock is formed of crimson wood. *Ghosthand’s Comet* is a *+4 major striking beast‑bane*SoM *greater impactful*SoM advanced firearm with a range increment of 300 feet. It deals 5d8 force damage and has the backstabber, concussive, kickback, and fatal d12 traits. As a star gun, *Ghosthand’s Comet* runs on magic and doesn’t use ammunition or black powder. The weapon is silent when fired.

**Activate** [free-action] (concentrate) **Trigger** You attempt a ranged Strike with *Ghosthand’s Comet*; **Effect** For the triggering Strike, *Ghosthand’s Comet* changes its damage type to your choice of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate) **Effect** On your next attempt at a ranged Strike with *Ghosthand’s Comet*, the shot phases through any material or magical obstacle, such as a *wall of force*, in its path, ignoring all cover. You must attempt the

  Strike by the end of your turn or this effect is lost.         **Destruction** If the Grim Reaper slays the wielder of *Ghosthand’s Comet*, the Reaper’s scythe, as it strikes the killing blow, is destined to slice the star gun in half.

Perfected Robes

Irori, the Master of Masters, achieved self-perfection and ascended as a deity. His faithful strive to perfect body, mind, and spirit. According to legend, on rare occasions, a worthy Iroran dreams of a mountain peak atop which a shrine of white stone sits, flanked by two plum trees.

Every enlightened dreamer who has journeyed to this mountain, overcome the trials to reach its summit, and bested the test within the shrine has donned *perfected robes*, the highest honor in the Iroran faith.

# PERFECTED ROBES ITEM 22

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RARE | ARTIFACT | DIVINE | INVESTED |

**Usage** worn garment; **Bulk** L                         These unadorned white robes, fastened with simple brass pins in the shape of a human hand, can’t be soiled or blemished. While wearing *perfected robes*, you don’t need to eat, sleep, or drink, but you can if you choose to. The robes bless you with constant *truesight* (+32 counteract bonus). A creature who dons these robes without earning them is clumsy 3, enfeebled 3, and stupefied 3 while wearing them, gaining the *truesight* but otherwise unable to use the robes’ magic.

### Activate [free-action] (concentrate, fortune) Frequency once per minute; Effect If your next action is to attempt a d20 roll

‌with which you have legendary proficiency, roll twice and take the better result.‌‌‌

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate) Frequency once per day; Effect

  You cast *avatar*, gaining the abilities for Irori.           **Destruction** If the wearer ever willingly turns from the path of self-perfection into corruption or overindulgence, their *perfected robes* crumble to nothing.

Scale of Igroon

The kaiju Igroon, the“Dragon Eater,”lairs in the mountains of Shenmen in Tian Xia. Its reputation for hunting dragons strikes fear into the hearts of all dragonkind.

Igroon’s reflective, chitinous scales contain various useful properties. The exact material of Igroon’s scales is unknown, but it’s uncannily durable, and the scales have the capability to bend light around them. A shield made from these scales retains these preternatural properties.

# SCALE OF IGROON ITEM 21

RARE

ARTIFACT PRIMAL

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                         Carved from a scale of the kaiju Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A *scale of Igroon* (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder’s turn. When you Raise a Shield, you can use the Shield Block reaction with the *scale of Igroon* to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Requirements You’re in an area of bright or dim light; Effect You angle the shield to refract light. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 item bonus to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak and can do so while observed. This bonus ends if you Activate another ability or use the Shield Block reaction.

### Activate [one-action] (manipulate) Requirements You’re in an area of bright light; Effect You angle the shield at a target within 60 feet, reflecting light into its eyes. It must attempt a DC 42 Fortitude save.

### Critical Success The target is unaffected.

### Success The target is blinded until its next turn begins.

### Failure The target is blinded for 1 minute.

### Critical Failure The target is blinded for 2d4 hours.

**Activate** [free-action] (manipulate) **Trigger** You use Shield Block and prevent yourself from taking energy damage from a line, ray, or a direct attack, including a *force barrage* spell; **Effect** You reflect the energy along a trajectory you choose. The effect travels only up to its remaining range, using its

  original parameters if it strikes other targets.           **Destruction** If a deity, kaiju, spawn of a deity, titan, or being of similar power stomps on a *scale of Igroon* while in absolute darkness, the shield is destroyed permanently.

Starfaring Cloak

It’s said Desna wove each *starfaring cloak* as a gift for a follower of exceptional devotion, plucking out a small portion of the night sky to form its fabric. Twelve *starfaring*

cloaks are known to exist. Desnan temples or priests own most of these, although a few adorn the backs of lay devotees on important journeys. Lamashtu’s worshippers loathe these sacred relics of the Desnan faith and seek to destroy them.

# STARFARING CLOAK ITEM 24

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RARE | ARTIFACT | DIVINE | INVESTED | LIGHT |  |

**Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L                           The swirling folds of a *starfaring cloak* appear to contain the night sky, with the stars rotating hypnotically through its firmament shedding dim light to a range of 10 feet. While wearing the cloak, you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your Speed and a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You can survive comfortably without breathing, in the void of space, and in severe or extreme cold or heat. Also, you gain sustenance from starlight and sunlight, so if you’re outdoors for an hour or more per day, you don’t need to eat or drink. While wearing the cloak, you can navigate perfectly and unerringly by looking up at the sky.

### Activate [reaction] (concentrate, fortune) Frequency once per day; Trigger You make an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw; Effect Reroll the triggering roll and take the higher result.

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The cloak casts *sleep* at 4th rank (DC 42).

**Activate** [three-actions] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per week; **Effect** The cloak casts *teleport* at 10th rank. If you name no destination, it teleports you to a random planet in a random

  location that’s safe for you.                     **Destruction** If the wearer of a *starfaring cloak* is bound by *imprisonment* for a century and a day, the cloak dissolves into light. This time is reduced to a year and a day if the wearer is placed in eternal slumber by *imprisonment* and subjected to the *nightmare* spell once per day.

Whisperer of Souls

Eons ago, the *Whisperer of Souls* was gifted to Shelyn’s half-brother, then known as Dou-Bral. Shelyn took the glaive after his transformation into Zon-Kuthon, fearing it had aided in his corruption.

It’s said the glaive’s ability to absorb souls feeds a wicked entity in the void where Dou-Bral was lost. This tale says if the glaive ever holds 100 souls, the weapon will allow that malevolent being to incarnate. Freeing a soul from the glaive requires a quest of benevolence, and Shelyn relinquishes the glaive only to a trusted follower on such a mission.

# WHISPERER OF SOULS ITEM 28

UNIQUE

ARTIFACT DIVINE

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 2                           This *+4 major striking greater brilliant keen glaive* binds the souls of powerful creatures it slays. The soul can’t be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical

success with a Strike against such a target, the creature must attempt a DC 50 Fortitude save.

### Critical Success No additional effect.

### Success The glaive siphons the creature’s essence, rendering it drained 1. If the creature dies from the Strike or while drained in this way, the creature’s soul is bound in the glaive.

### Failure As success, but the creature is drained 2.

### Critical Failure As success, but the creature is drained 4. The glaive also has the following activations.

**Activate** [free-action] (concentrate) **Trigger** You Strike with the *Whisperer of Souls*; **Effect** You choose whether the Strike deals lethal or nonlethal damage. If the glaive has a reason for doing so, such as slaying a creature whose soul the glaive can absorb, it can defy your choice if you fail a DC 50 Will save.

### Activate [free-action] (concentrate) Trigger You attempt an Occultism check to Decipher Writing, Identify Magic, Learn a Spell, or Recall Knowledge; Effect You listen to eldritch secrets the weapon whispers, gaining a +4 item bonus to the triggering check.

### Activate [three-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Frequency once per

week; **Effect** Attempt an Occultism check as if you cast the *collective memories* ritual about a subject. If you succeed, you can repeat what the *Whisperer of Souls* relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a DC 50 Will save.

### Success When you return, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore skill about unholy creatures or places, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.

### Failure As success, but you are stupefied 2 for 1 week.

### Critical Failure As success, but you become unholy. If you were holy, you instead lose that trait. You must retrain one of your skills into a Lore about unholy creatures or places. You become obsessed with increasing your forbidden knowledge, turning to wicked forces that offer such secrets

   and compromising your morals further if you must.       **Destruction** If the *Whisperer of Souls* is used to slay Shelyn’s herald, it disintegrates, bringing about great evil in its wake.

‌ARCHETYPE ARTIFACTS‌‌

## Most artifacts are created with specific parameters and capabilities, their power determined at the moment of their creation and set forever after. Most, but not all. Some artifacts instead rely on a resonance with their wielder to reveal their true power, growing with their owner over time to become more. Whether this is through a symbiotic relationship between artifact and wielder or simply a parasitic empowerment of the artifact as it drains power from its host, such items are often

## unpredictable, unusual, and potentially quite powerful.

## —Valashinaz, Mistress of the Vault

Archetype artifacts are powerful items that grant access to archetype feats linked to the artifact. Once an archetype artifact is invested, it can’t be removed or uninvested by normal means. Gaining possession of an archetype artifact and investing it gives you access to its related archetype feats in the same way that taking the dedication feat for a standard archetype allows you to choose its feats whenever you gain a class feat. A character can invest only one archetype artifact at a time. Attempting to invest an additional archetype artifact fails as the first artifact’s claim over you outweighs the second’s; no benefits are granted, the second artifact is not invested, and you are aware of the failure. If the artifact is destroyed, the bonded character also loses

access to any of its granted feats and must immediately retrain all feats granted by the archetype artifact for new feats that they qualify for.

Archetype artifacts are intended to be used in conjunction with the free archetype variant rules originally presented in *GM Core*, which are reprinted below for convenience. However, some stories might work better without this variant; for instance, if a character wants to play an otherwise-ordinary baker or stable hand who stumbles upon an artifact that becomes their main source of power, rather than an apprentice wizard who bonds to one for greater power. Since players must have possession of the archetype artifact to take its feats, you should ensure that they come across it before

‌they would gain their first free archetype feat (typically meaning they should acquire the artifact just before they reach 2nd level.) Generally, archetype artifacts should not‌‌‌‌

her a bear’s strength and ferocity, though it was unclear                  at the time whether this was a boast.

be given to players unless all the players at the table have access to either their own archetype artifact or another archetype gained via the free archetype variant.

Free Archetype

Sometimes the story of your game calls for a group where everyone is a pirate or an apprentice at a magic school. The free archetype variant introduces a shared aspect to every character without taking away any of that character’s existing choices.

BUILDING A CHARACTER

The only difference between a normal character and a free-archetype character is that the character receives an extra class feat at 2nd level and every even level thereafter that they can use only for archetype feats. Depending on the needs of the group and the theme of the game, you might restrict the free feats to those of a single archetype each character in the group has (for a shared backstory), those of archetypes fitting a certain theme (such as only ones from magical archetypes in a game set in a magic school), or entirely unrestricted if you just want a higher-powered game.

If the group all has the same archetype or draws from a limited list, you might want to ignore the free archetype’s normal restriction of selecting a certain number of feats before taking a new archetype. That way a character can still pursue another archetype that also fits their character.

PLAYING WITH FREE ARCHETYPES

Free-archetype characters are a bit more versatile and powerful than normal, but usually not so much that they unbalance your game. However, due to the characters’ increased access to archetype feats, you should place a limit on the number of feats that scale based on a character’s number of archetype feats (mainly multiclass Resiliency feats). Allowing a character to benefit from a number of these feats equal to half their level is appropriate, as this is the maximum number of feats you could use to take archetype feats without this variant.

Ursine Avenger Hood

Some items inherit their magic not through an intentional spell or ritual but through generations of use and belief, slowly accumulating power and intent from those around them. The *Ursine Avenger Hood* is such an item. After defeating a powerful cave bear, the Ulfen hunter Baruk shaped the bear’s head and fur into a helm and cape for himself. Baruk later fell in battle against a linnorm, successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm’s curse, was claimed by Baruk’s

Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact’s potential has continued to grow. Now, those who bond with the generational artifact will discover that the *Ursine Avenger Hood* continues to grow in power alongside them.

# URSINE AVENGER HOOD ITEM 2

UNIQUE

ARTIFACT INVESTED PRIMAL

**Usage** worn headwear; **Bulk** L                     A gift passed from warrior to warrior, this cowl is made from a cave bear’s skull and fur. Once invested, the wearer gains a +1 item bonus to Nature checks to Command an Animal, which increases to +2 if the animal is a bear. The wearer of the hood feels a constant longing for the wilderness and wild places and takes a –1 item penalty to all Diplomacy checks to Gather Information or Make an Impression if they go more than 5 days inside a large town or city without spending at least 4 hours in the wilderness.             **Destruction** Soak the *Ursine Avenger Hood* in the blood of a linnorm that is at least 16th level and then burn it in a fire that uses only oak and chrysanthemum as fuel.

# URSINE AVENGER FORM [one-action] FEAT 2

| ARCHETYPE | ARTIFACT | MORPH | PRIMAL |  |

You draw the *Ursine Avenger Hood* over your head and its fur over your arms, assuming an ursine form that has traits of your original form as well as that of a bear. In your ursine form, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and a claws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage and has the agile trait. Both unarmed attacks are in the brawling group. You lose the ability to speak complex sentences while transformed and can only communicate through grunts and gestures; this prevents you from using effects that require a shared or spoken language until you revert back to your non-hybrid form. You can use this action while transformed to remove the hood and return to your original form.

# SENSES OF THE BEAR FEAT 4

While in ursine form, you gain low-light vision and scent (imprecise) 30 feet. If you already had low-light vision, you instead gain darkvision.

Gelid Shard

The Varki wizard T’aak Chamin once traveled from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings northward, past the Winterwall Glacier and deep into the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World. T’aak was seeking immortality without the risk of undeath, and he followed the hints and clues of ancient legends that spoke of “the frozen immortals,” and of ancient magics of ice crafting that were once commonly traded between these rumored immortals and the Erutaki people, who share ancestral roots with the Varki.

Little is known of T’aak’s journeys in the northern wastes, though all accounts that record anything of the wizard and his trek indicate that the man who returned was different in many ways than the man who first traveled north. T’aak spoke of beings known as saumen kar, of a “great whale” sealed beneath the ice, and of strange corruptions. An account left by his wife mentions that T’aak often awoke screaming about “malignant sludge” and a “disease clawing at the ancient gates.” Despite all this, T’aak’s primary quest did result in at least one notable accomplishment: the crafting of the first *gelid shard*.

Gelid shards are arcane focuses of refined magical cold in physical form. Unfortunately for their creator, gelid shards do not grant immortality, though mortal creatures bonded to them do often have slightly longer lifespans thanks to the preserving cold that inundates and surrounds them.

| RARE | ARCANE | ARTIFACT | COLD | INVESTED |  |

This crystal shard shimmers with its own light even as it seems to draw the heat out of its surroundings. Plunging it into your heart grants you the tranquil lethality of deepest winter, but the more you draw upon its power, the colder your heart grows. Your frozen heart dulls your emotions. When you gain a bonus from an emotion effect, that bonus is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0. At 10th level, the bonus is reduced by 2. Your dulled emotions make it hard to relate to others; the DC of checks to Make an Impression or Request a favor of other creatures, or to Aid in such attempts, is increased by +2. You gain resistance to cold equal to your level and a +2 status bonus to all saves against emotion effects.                         **Destruction** The *gelid shard* must be left exposed in the Plane of Fire for a week and a day, then smashed with an adamantine hammer by someone who felt true love for the shard’s creator.

| RARE | CANTRIP | COLD | CONCENTRATE |

### Tradition arcane

### Range 30 feet; Targets 1 object

Your *gelid shard* drinks down nearby heat in a futile attempt to sate itself and achieve a level of frigid cold unheard of in the Universe. This allows you to cool a drink, make a hot pot safe to handle, or other, similar minor effects. Once cooled, the object’s temperature is subject to its environment as usual. You can also solidify ambient moisture into a solid object; this temporary object is of negligible Bulk, made of non-magical ice. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can’t be used as a tool, weapon, or locus or cost for a spell. Once created, it melts as normal for ice for the ambient conditions.

### Heightened (3rd) You can create simple objects of ice with up to 1 Bulk and of a level not exceeding 1. Such objects must be rigid. You can only have one such object created at a time; if you create another, the previous object melts instantly.

### Heightened (5th) Items you create can be up to 4 Bulk and 4th level.

### Heightened (7th) Items you create can be up to 8 Bulk and 8th level.

‌BLIGHTED BOONS‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌

## The stuff in here is... Well, it’s different. It’s not really good or bad, but it’s also both. Every item in this section is something that folks like you and me weren’t really meant to have. They can grant incredible magic power, but it always comes at a price. If you don’t give that power up, then eventually, it consumes you entirely. One of the boss’s hatchlings snuck in here once and drank a vial of vampire blood that

## turned them into a vampiric dragon! That was cool for a bit. Didn’t end well.

## —Purepurin

Magical manifestations of unusual power, blighted boons resemble consumables in that a creature can take in the manifestation to gain its effects. However, these manifestations contain powers not meant for mortals. Once someone partakes, they begin a slide toward disaster as the power eats away at their body, mind, or both. Death is a blessing compared to the fates awaiting those who consume some blighted boons.

Using Blighted Boons

When someone finds a blighted boon, they discover its manifestation. Manifestations can seem innocuous, such as a potion in a bottle. Other manifestations are grander displays, such as crystallized flame. Some blighted boons have a storied history, so anyone who knows the legends knows the risks. Other blighted boons are more obscure, functioning like hazardous treasure.

Blighted boons can elevate your campaign in multiple ways. A creature might partake of a blighted boon without understanding the ramifications of doing so. Other beings might seek out a blighted boon for its gift, often to use the imparted might in a dire situation that merits taking the risks. Some blighted boons present their effects to potential users in visions or by other means. For such boons, no one can consume them without understanding, at least partly, what they’re doing. In any case, a blighted boon offers great, temporary power at a cost, requiring daring undertakings to undo the long-term effects before it’s too late.

PARTAKING

Someone who partakes of a blighted boon unwillingly can attempt a saving throw to resist the effect. The save DC equals 10 + the partaker’s level. Those who willingly consume the boon can’t attempt a save. A creature that fails the save or doesn’t attempt one moves to the blighted boon’s stage 1.

When a blighted boon imparts its initial effect on a partaker, the boon’s manifestation disappears. Any pieces that remain contain none of the boon’s power.

Those who roll a success or critical success at the save resist the boon. Such a partaker gains no further effect.

In some cases, a blighted boon remanifests after this refusal, giving others the opportunity to partake of its power. Blighted boons that have this power say so in their descriptions. Others are used up, as with a consumable magic item.

PROGRESSION

A blighted boon grows in potency within the user’s body, progressing in stages. While in any stage from a blighted boon, the partaker is temporarily immune to other versions of the same blighted boon. Unless the boon’s description says otherwise, the effects of each stage combine, often growing stronger over time.

Intervals

Blighted boon stages advance in intervals, amounts of time shown in parentheses for each stage. Once a stage’s interval passes, the partaker can attempt a saving throw against the blighted boon. The save DC equals 10 + the partaker’s level + the blighted boon’s current stage

+ the number of previous successful saving throws. On a failure, the partaker advances to the next stage. Success means the boon remains at its current stage for the same interval. The partaker can’t reduce a blighted boon’s stage. To do that, the blight must be subjected to successful purging—see [page 187.](#bookmark435)

savIng throws

If an effect a partaker creates with a blighted boon requires the target to attempt a saving throw, the DC equals the character’s class DC or the DC you assign to an NPC or monster. If the partaker must attempt a save against the blighted boon, unless stated otherwise (such as in the Intervals section), the DC equals 10 + the partaker’s level

+ the blighted boon’s current stage.

Death

Most blighted boons affect those who die under the boon’s effects in special, unusual ways, as noted in a boon’s description. Also, every blighted boon destroys a user who uses the boon’s power too long. This doom varies in form.

186

‌PURGING‌‌‌‌

A blighted boon is difficult to get rid of, and the Purging section of each boon entry details the only way to do

slowed 3 if the d20 shows a 1. Your weakness to fire and

vulnerability to axes equals your level.

Stage          4          You          die.

so. If a partaker satisfies the Purging conditions, all the blighted boon’s effects end. For other effects that suppress or dispel magic, treat a blighted boon as an artifact.

Elder Seed

Each *elder seed* was created by a canopy elder to aid other creatures, such as druids and other wilderness guardians. Many druids see these seeds as sacred, and some druids take such a seed when ready to pass on from mortal life. Others take the seed when bound for an important task in service to nature, seeing the risk as worth the blessing. Doubtless, a few *elder seeds* have been lost, sitting in abandoned bowers or ancient places, awaiting discovery.

# ELDER SEED ITEM 11

RARE CONSUMABLE PRIMAL

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                           An enormous, perfect, ripe seed from a tree important to a region’s druids, an *elder seed* exudes vitality. Plant life grows quickly and abundantly around it. Anyone who touches the seed understands the nature of its power. Swallowing it whole imparts its effects, but succeeding at the save against the boon causes the swallower to regurgitate the seed.     **Stage 1 (9 Days)** Your skin hardens, giving you a brownish-green tinge. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage and piercing damage equal to your level, and you have tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet. Also, you can cast *enlarge*, *speak with animals*, 4th-rank *speak with plants*, and *web*PC2 each once per day as primal innate spells. The web is a dense mycelial net rather than spider silk.     **Stage 2 (1 Month)** You gain low-light vision and fluency in Arboreal. However, your body feels stiffer, your mind slower to move to intense emotions, and you are prone to take your time making decisions. You become clumsy 1, take a –1 status penalty to initiative rolls, and gain a weakness to fire damage equal to half your level, and you take the same amount of additional damage from axes.

If you die at this stage or higher, your body sinks into the earth, forming rich soil. Over several days, a mature, full-sized tree of the seed’s type grows where you fell. If plant growth is impossible, such as due to lack of sunlight, fungi grow there instead, extending mycelia through the earth until they reach a place the tree can grow. Then, the tree grows. An arboreal can tend this tree to cause it to regrow one *elder seed* after 3 years and 3 days.           **Stage 3 (1 Month)** You become more treelike and ponderous in body and mind, and when you cast the *enlarge* innate spell from this boon, you can cast it at 4th rank. The clumsy value increases to 2 and the status penalty increases to –2. Whenever you roll initiative, you become slowed 1 automatically, slowed 2 if the d20 roll is 10 or lower, or

**Purging** You must seek out an arboreal, druid, or nature-loving fey that is your level or higher whom you have never met, and pledge your allegiance to that being. Doing so places you under a *geas* to accomplish at least one meaningful service, usually a quest, for your new liege. While under the *geas*, you can’t advance to stage 4. Once you complete your service, you regurgitate the *elder seed*, and its effects on you end.

Heartblood Ring

Mighty vampires use a special ritual to create *heartblood*, a grisly concoction intended as both temptation and scourge for the living. Such vampires offer this accursed libation to vulnerable people with access to influence or wealth the vampire would prefer to control rather than merely seize. Tales emphasize that the solution, affecting only living creatures, creates a heady rush of vitality, long-lasting euphoria, and agelessness. It also grants access to supernatural powers. While the fell liquid can be stored in almost any container, vampires often gift a dose of it sealed within a ring so that the recipient can use it when circumstances become dire and they’re tempted to take an easy way out.

# HEARTBLOOD RING ITEM 15

RARE CONSUMABLE MAGICAL

### Usage worn; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                               Sealed inside the hidden compartment of a gold ring, *heartblood* has an unmistakable coppery taste, along with a thick mouth feel. A whiff of the concoction is pleasantly stimulating.                                 **Stage 1 (1 Week)** The first time you enter this stage from a particular dose of *heartblood*, you are affected as if by *regenerate*. Each round this effect functions, it attempts to counteract one disease or poison affecting you with a bonus equal to your class DC – 10. *Heartblood* also reduces physical signs of aging, altering your appearance to that of vigorous adulthood for your ancestry. (Non-adults who drink *heartblood* change only in apparent vigor, not age.)

You have fast healing equal to half your level, as well as resistance to void damage and poison damage equal to half your level. Also, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep. Treat the outcome of any saving throw you roll against death, paralyze, or sleep effects as one step better.                         **Stage 2 (1 Month)** You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 2 × your level; you are doomed 1. You develop a pallor and a dislike of bright light, especially sunlight. If suddenly exposed to bright light, you are dazzled until the end of your next turn.

‌While in an area of sunlight, you remain dazzled until 1 round after the exposure ends. Normal food is unsatisfying, and you have urges to consume blood; when confronted with the opportunity to do so, you must succeed at a Will save to avoid it. Doing so once after each time you roll initiative is enough. Your normal coloration returns for a few hours after you drink blood.‌

If you die at this stage or higher, your body becomes a bloody mist that sinks 6 feet into the ground. The third night thereafter, you rise from the earth as a vampire. This typically makes you unholy. You are under the control of the *heartblood*’s creator unless your level is higher than that creature’s. The controlling vampire senses you and guides you to them via psychic link. Significant destruction of your body and circumstances that prevent the formation of undead stop this effect.                           **Stage 3 (1 Month)** You gain darkvision and now have fast healing equal to your level. A death effect can’t automatically kill you or increase your dying value. Reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 4 × your level, rounded up, instead of 2 × your level; you are doomed 2. Your hunger for blood increases, so if you fail to drink a cup or so each day, you are considered to have gone without food that day. You are also slowed 1 while in sunlight, becoming slowed 2 after 1 minute. Your shadow is wispy, and your reflection in mirrors ghostly, which are apparent signs of vampirism to those who know such facts.                                 **Stage 4** You die.                                 **Purging** *Heartblood* loses its potency if the vampire who created it is destroyed. However, a dose of *heartblood* imposes a –2 status penalty to your saving throws against the powers of the vampire who created it.

Phoenix Cinder

A phoenix is a force for compassion and the spread of knowledge, as well as a symbol of life and rebirth. Yet there are wicked beings who choose to slay a phoenix, despite the depravity of such a horrible act. Rather than destroying its body, they use powerful magic to place the phoenix’s last cinders in stasis with a special *imprisonment* ritual. This despicable deed, which works only on a holy phoenix, serves a few purposes. The phoenix remains slain, its essence trapped in the cinders, allowing one who consumes it to wield some of the phoenix’s fiery powers. But a phoenix’s scorching strength can’t be contained in another body. If the person who took in the cinder dies, a corrupted phoenix is reborn. A partaker can purge the boon only with the death of another phoenix.

CONSUMABLE FIRE PRIMAL

RARE

PHOENIX CINDER                        ITEM 16

### Usage touched; Bulk —

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                           An incandescent, multipronged crystal the color of dying fire, a *phoenix cinder* gives off pleasant warmth and a sense

of peace. A low, soft chirruping around the crystal invokes the idea of using fire to cleanse and protect. The crystal offers this power to anyone who touches it. A partaker must be willing to gain the boon’s effects.                       **Stage 1 (1 Week)** The first time you enter this stage from a particular *phoenix cinder*, you are affected as if by *regenerate*. For 3 days after taking in the cinder, you are immune to fire. While in this stage or higher, you have fast healing equal to half your level, as well as resistance to fire damage equal to half your level. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against fire. Treat the outcome of any saving throw you roll against fire effects as one step better. You can cast *ignition* as an innate spell, and you have

access to the following activation.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate, fire) Frequency once per day; Effect You wreathe yourself in flame for 1 minute. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch you or hit you with an unarmed attack, take 2d6 fire damage. You can Dismiss

  the activation.                             **Stage 2 (1 Month)** You can use the activation once per hour. Always feverish and flushed, you feel as if temperatures lower than sweltering are cold. Reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 2 × your level, and you have a weakness to cold damage equal to half your level. You have urges to burn and use fire when you can. When confronted with the opportunity to do so, you must succeed at a Will save to avoid it. Doing so once after each time you roll initiative is enough.

If you die at this stage or higher, your body burns from the inside out over 1d4 rounds, reducing you to fine ash. Anything flammable on you is destroyed. A phoenix emerges from your remains, but doesn’t have the holy trait and is interested more in selfish pursuits and spreading fire than kindness. You also attempt a DC 8 flat check; on a failure, the phoenix gains the unholy trait, and also thirsts for vengeance against the little beings like the one who dared to use its power for a time.                           **Stage 3 (1 Month)** You now have fast healing equal to your level but reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 4

× your level, rounded up, instead of 2 × your level. Also, you have a weakness to cold damage equal to your level and a weakness to unholy equal to half your level. You can use the activation you previously gained once per minute, but you can no longer Dismiss it. Whenever you drop to 0 Hit Points, a *divine immolation* erupts from a randomly chosen point on the edge of your space.                           **Stage 4** You die.                                   **Purging** You must collect the remains of a phoenix of your level or higher who has been unable to self-resurrect, compressing the remains with powdered diamonds, opals, and rubies worth 75 gp × your level into an egg. You can then use *divine immolation* as if you dropped to 0 Hit Points during this boon’s stage 3. If you do so, the phoenix whose remains you collected is reborn as if it used its Self-Resurrection, and the *phoenix cinder*’s effects end on you.

Void fragment

Obscure legends speak of *void fragments*, telling of a crystalline wisp appearing to those who desired mastery over mind and space. According to these legends, a person seeking a *void fragment* must travel to a location where strange magics naturally gather; such locations include haunted houses, places where spirits or incorporeal undead regularly slip through the veil between the mortal and spiritual realms, ancient temples to forgotten gods of darkness and grim emotions, or other locations where the walls between planes are thin. Once the seeker has found such a location, they must meditate for six days and six nights, lowering their mental and spiritual defenses while calling out to the creatures that lurk beyond. Often these rituals end in disaster, but occasionally a *void fragment* appears in response to the seeker’s call.

By touching the wisp, the partaker gained such power, only to vanish suddenly one day. Some of these tales include the monstrous visitation that followed the abrupt disappearance, but few accurately connect the two incidents. More narratives include the effects of a *void fragment*, but only an erudite reader could deduce this truth from such stories’ clues.

# VOID FRAGMENT ITEM 13

RARE CONSUMABLE OCCULT

### Usage touched; Bulk —

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                               Hovering midair, thrumming and whispering of its power, a *void fragment* is a crystalline fragment of swirling colors, reminiscent of stars and deep darkness. It thrums intermittently with a beckoning vibration, drawing attention from and pulling at nearby creatures with a tangible sense of gravity. A chill hangs in the air around it. At a touch, the wisp vanishes, giving the point of contact a gangrenous color. If the partaker succeeds at the initial save, the wisp reappears somewhere on the same planet.                 **Stage 1 (8 Days)** The first time you enter this stage from a given *void fragment*, you gain the effect of a *potion of truespeech* for 3 days. The wisp grants you telepathy with a range of 30 feet. Also, you are under the effects of *hidden*

mind, except that its status bonus is +1 and it counteracts with a modifier equal to your class DC – 9 or your spell DC – 9, whichever is higher. The wisp grants you resistance to mental damage equal to half your level. You also have access to the following activation.

### Activate [one-action] or [two-actions] (concentrate, teleportation) Frequency once per hour; Effect You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you used 2 actions, you

  can teleport up to 60 feet.                     **Stage 2 (24 Days)** You gain imprecise thoughtsense to half your telepathy’s range, which increases to 60 feet. However, you have a tough time filtering the mental noise. If any creatures can be detected by your thoughtsense, you take a –1 penalty to Perception checks. When you arrive in a space after using the activation to teleport, you create a 10-foot emanation that works like *strange geometry* (*Player Core 2* 252) for 1 round. This emanation can affect you.

If you die at this stage or higher, your body implodes. Your soul reincarnates as an aberration of a level close to yours, which extrudes from the location of your implosion. Common forms include jah-tohl, gosreg, quelaunt, rhu-chalik, shoggoth (*Monster Core 2* 285), and xoarian. This creature isn’t you, but fleeting memories of your former existence remain with it. You can’t be raised from the dead while this monster endures. Its mindset is as alien as one of these aberrations, barely resembling yours at all. The *void* *fragment* reappears somewhere on the same planet.       **Stage 3 (32 Days)** Your telepathy range increases to 100 feet, and the wisp grants you resistance to mental damage equal to your level. The mental noise increases the penalty to Perception to –2. Whenever you roll initiative, you become confused for up to 1d4 rounds.                 **Stage 4** You die.                               **Purging** You must find and slay a powerful aberration or a servant of such creatures the GM deems appropriate. The creature must be of your level or higher. Then, someone must cast a *rest eternal* ritual (*Player Core 2* 270) on you and the dead being; you must be anointed with the same oils the ritual normally requires. If the ritual results in a success, it casts the slain creature into the void along with the *void fragment* inside you, ending its effects on you.

RARE CURSED MAGICAL

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                     The hilt of a *bellicose dagger* is etched with the word for “war” in various languages. Having absorbed the spirit of violence over the course of its existence, the weapon now craves bloodshed. A *bellicose dagger* is a *+1 striking wounding dagger*.

| RARE | CONSUMABLE | CURSED | PRIMAL |

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate)                           *Bower fruit* got its name from its association with the Green Mother, a fey Eldest with a fondness for plants and manipulation, whose domain is known as the Hanging Bower. She uses these cursed fruits to keep mortals in her thrall, but it’s unknown whether she created them or simply popularized their use.

A *bower fruit* condemns a non-fey who tastes it to never again be satisfied with the fare found in the mundane Universe. Any fruit can be cursed in this manner, but stone fruits such as peaches, plums, mangoes, and lychees are most common. Upon activating a *bower fruit* by eating it, you’re afflicted with the curse of decadence. You can’t recover from stage 1 of the curse naturally, even if you succeed at the save to do so.

### Curse of Decadence (curse) Saving Throw DC 30 Fortitude; Stage 1 You’re afflicted by hunger as if you hadn’t eaten food in days. You become fatigued and take 1d4 damage each day that can’t be healed until you sate your hunger. No amount of eating food can sate your hunger during the spell’s duration, with one exception—food from the First

World sates your hunger and suppresses the effects, but permanently increases the save DC by 1 (to a maximum of DC 35). After the week ends, if your hunger is still not sated, you take damage from starvation. (1 week); **Stage 2** As stage 1, plus you’re sickened 1; **Stage 3** As stage 1, plus

you’re drained 1 and sickened 1; **Stage 4** As stage 1, plus

you’re drained 2, sickened 2, and stupefied 2.

# CORRUPTION CASSOCK ITEM 11

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RARE | CURSED | DIVINE | FOCUSED | INTELLIGENT | INVESTED | UNHOLY |  |

**Usage** worn garment; **Bulk** L                       **Perception** +20; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet **Communication** telepathy (Common, Empyreal, four other

languages)

### Skills Deception +21, Diplomacy +19, Religion +19

### Int +2, Wis +5, Cha +4

**Will** +20                                 Devotees of benevolent faiths fear and loathe *corruption cassocks*, each of which is dedicated to an unholy deity. When the garment chooses a target, such as when it senses a worshipper of a deity who isn’t unholy, it alters its form to match another deity’s iconography, appearing to be a *devoted vestments* for that deity. Once donned, the cassock tries to subtly sway its wearer to the worship of its deity. If the wearer begins to succumb, the *corruption cassock* gradually reverts to its true appearance, replacing its false iconography as its wearer converts.

A *corruption cassock* functions as a *devoted vestments* for any wearer it chooses. Once you invest the cassock, it fuses to you. While you remain loyal to another deity, you believe the cassock grants you a +2 item bonus to Religion checks and a +1 item bonus to the divine skill of the deity to whom you believe the cassock is dedicated. It does neither. The GM secretly adjusts your checks with those skills, causing you to fail at religious tasks more often. If you have multiple equal or lower item bonuses to the affected skills, the cassock takes precedence, negating those bonuses. If you convert to following the cassock’s true unholy deity, however, these bonuses function normally for you.

If you attempt to Cast a Spell that has the holy trait, the cassock can force you to attempt a DC 28 Will save. On a

190

‌failure, you’re stupefied 1 for one minute (stupefied 2 on a critical failure). A *corruption cassock* uses this ability to convince you that your deity has forsaken you.

but a critical success does nothing. The doomed value from

the codex can decrease only after it’s no longer fused to you;            once it’s fused to you, you remain its intended victim unless you

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a cleric domain spell for a domain belonging to the deity you believe the cassock is dedicated to. If you don’t spend this Focus Point by the end of this turn, it’s lost. However, when you use this activation, the *corruption cassock* can instead cast a domain spell of the same rank from its deity. It does so only to confuse and dismay you, harming your faith.

# CRUSHING COILS ITEM 5

RARE

CURSED INVESTED MAGICAL

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1                         Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this *+1 leather armor* wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you’re restrained for 1 round.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate, manipulate) Effect The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.

# DULLAHAN CODEX ITEM 20

UNIQUE

CURSED GRIMOIRE MAGICAL

**Bulk** L                                     The origins of the notorious *Dullahan Codex* are shrouded in mystery. Some legends claim it belongs to a dullahan whose head was taken by the Grim Reaper. Others attribute its creation to a powerful necromancer whose name has been lost to time. Whatever the truth, the grimoire has passed down through the ages, sometimes via mortal hands and other times mysteriously appearing among the possessions of its next target. It deserves its reputation for dooming those who possess it to die, but scholars debate whether the codex causes this fate or merely acts as its harbinger.

The *Dullahan Codex* is a jet-black tome bearing a single rune embossed on its cover, and it functions as a *true endless grimoire* (*Secrets of Magic* 162). Inside, scrawled across its parchment pages in a delicate, spidery script, is a lengthy list of names that always appears in a reader’s native alphabet. The grimoire isn’t sentient, but it selects its owners, quickly passing out of the hands of those it doesn’t choose. An intended victim’s name appears on the list of names.

If your name is on the list and you touch the volume or read from its pages, you must attempt a DC 45 Will save.

### Critical Success The codex disappears, moving on to a new victim.

### Success The codex fuses to you.

### Failure The codex fuses to you, and you become doomed 1.

### Critical Failure As failure, but you’re doomed 2.

If you attempt to get rid of the codex while it’s fused to you, it returns to your possession within an hour. Each day the codex is fused to you, you must attempt another Will saving throw,

complete a *freedom* ritual aimed at ending this 10th-rank effect. (On a critical failure with this ritual, the codex adds all casters to its list.) You can redirect the curse by inscribing another person’s name in the grimoire and succeeding at a DC 40 Arcana or Occultism check. Doing so is an unholy act, anathema to many deities. If the curse is ritually ended or redirected, or the chosen victim dies, the codex moves on to a new victim.

# ENERGY TOXIN BOTTLE ITEM 7

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RARE | CONSUMABLE | CURSED | MAGICAL | POTION |  |

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                       This glass bottle embellished with brass decorations appears to be a *lesser energy breath potion* of a specific type, but has been polluted, making it toxic to use.

**Activate** [one-action] (manipulate) **Effect** You drink from the bottle and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure) and immediately vomit the potion directly onto yourself, taking 5d6 damage of the same damage type the potion deals and expending the item. If you succeed at your Fortitude save, you become sickened 1 but otherwise are able to unleash Energy Breath as normal for a *lesser energy breath potion* of the appropriate type.

# GAFFE GLASSES ITEM 3

RARE

CURSED INVESTED MAGICAL

**Usage** worn eyepiece; **Bulk** L                       These wire-rim glasses appear to be *glasses of sociability* (*Secrets of Magic* 185), making you think they grant a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy when they grant none. The GM secretly adjusts your Diplomacy checks to ignore the bonus, and if you have multiple +1 item bonuses to Diplomacy, the glasses take precedence, negating those bonuses.

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate) **Effect** Like *glasses of sociability*, with the same limitations, you stare at another creature. If you’ve met and exchanged names, you expect to instantly remember the target’s name. However, you recall the worst possible incorrect name, such as mistaking a famous artist for their hated rival. This blunder doesn’t prevent you from realizing the creature’s real name after you’ve been corrected. Once you use this activation, the glasses fuse to you.

HANDKERCHIEF OF DISAGREEABLE DISGUISE ITEM 2+

RARE

CURSED INVESTED MAGICAL

**Usage** worn; **Bulk** —                             This elegant scarf appears to be and functions as a *masquerade scarf*. When you invest the scarf, it fuses to you.

**Activate** 1 minute (manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** Like a *masquerade scarf*, the scarf casts a 1st-rank *illusory disguise* spell on you. However, the illusion disadvantages you based on your intent, making you, for example, appear to be a suspicious ruffian if you’re trying to sneak past guards or lending you the seeming of a pauper if you’re

# HECKLING TOOLS ITEM 3

RARE

CURSED INTELLIGENT MAGICAL

**Usage** as the base item; **Bulk** as the base item             **Perception** +9; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet **Communication** telepathy (two common languages)

### Skills Intimidation +9, one skill associated with their use +9

### Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2

**Will** +7                                   Tools or toolkits that are severely misused or left in malevolent circumstances can develop malicious sapience, dedicated to critiquing those who use them. Such *heckling tools* are often born from implements useful to adventurers because such people are the likely to misuse tools or leave them in a corrupting situation. When you first set to using the tools, they fuse to you. Used for their intended purpose, the tools telepathically badger and disparage you, mocking your abilities and giving you ill-founded advice. You must succeed at a DC 19 Will save to realize this badgering comes from the tools and not your own negative thoughts. Instead of the tool or toolkit’s usual bonus, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks made using *heckling tools*. Once you realize the tools are cursed, you can suppress their negative effects, gaining their typical bonus for 24 hours if you succeed at a DC 17 Deception or Diplomacy check to placate them, often by offering obsequious, public admiration.

# LUCKLESS DICE ITEM 2

RARE

CURSED MAGICAL MISFORTUNE

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L                     Carved of bone, *luckless dice* appear to be a normal set of dice. If identified as magical but not successfully identified as cursed, *luckless dice* seem to hold a minor enchantment that grants you a +1 item bonus on Games Lore checks to gamble with them. However, they fuse to you when you use them, cursing you with ill fortune. *Luckless dice* don’t grant a bonus on Games Lore checks. Instead, when you use them to gamble, the GM rolls secretly, granting you the lower result. If you realize the dice are cursed, you can still use them, though you still roll twice and take the lower result.

# MOTHER MAW ITEM 15

RARE

CURSED EXTRADIMENSIONAL MAGICAL

**Usage** placed on a surface; **Bulk** L                       This item appears to be and functions as a *portable hole*

[(page 115),](#bookmark262) but it’s actually the maw of an alien extradimensional creature akin to and older than a *bag of devouring*. Any animal or vegetable matter put in the hole has a chance of triggering the creature’s interest. Whenever you reach into the hole to retrieve an item or place an animal or plant product within the bag, roll a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the hole ignores the intrusion. On a failure, the *mother maw* devours the triggering material, removing it from existence. The maw can’t eat artifacts. If the triggering material isn’t entirely inside the maw, such as when someone reaches inside, the *mother maw* attempts to pull it completely inside using a Grapple action with a +28 Athletics bonus. On a success, it devours the victim or object.

Whenever the maw critically fails the Athletics check, it regurgitates one creature or object it previously devoured. The condition of the vomited creature or object depends on its resilience and the time it has spent inside the maw. Typically, the maw spews forth items it finds difficult to digest, such as those made of adamantine or protected by magic. It can and does regurgitate remains, though.

# RING OF RAVENOUSNESS ITEM 7

RARE

CURSED INVESTED MAGICAL

### Usage worn; Bulk —

Carved of acacia wood, a *ring of ravenousness* is inlaid with a geometric pattern. The ring appears to be a *ring of sustenance*. Once you invest it, though, it fuses to you, its effects activating immediately. While wearing the ring, you require twice the normal amount of food and drink for a creature your size to avoid starvation and thirst.

# SHARED-PAIN SANKEIT ITEM 14

RARE

CURSED INVESTED MAGICAL

### Usage worn armor; Bulk 3

A *shared‑pain sankeit* seems to be an impressive suit of *+2 resilient fortification duskwood sankeit* [(page 9)](#bookmark50) shaped to resemble a mighty linnorm. However, it protects you by drawing on the health of your nearby allies. When you roll the flat check for the armor’s *fortification* rune, it protects you normally when you roll a 20. When you roll a 17, 18, or 19, though, the GM determines damage for the critical hit normally, then distributes half to you and the other half evenly among allies within 30 feet of you. If no ally is within range to take the distributed damage, the *fortification* rune fails to function. This effect manifests the first time an attacker scores a critical hit on you, after which the armor fuses with you.

# SHRIEKING KEY ITEM 5

RARE

CURSED MAGICAL

### Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —

A skull-topped metal *shrieking key* appears to be a *skeleton key*, useful in place of thieves’ tools when attempting to Pick a Lock. A *shrieking key* has no activation, however. When you use it to Pick a Lock, the key emits a loud shriek audible for 500 feet despite ambient noise. Physical barriers still block or muffle the shriek as normal. You also take a

192

‌–2 circumstance penalty to the Thievery check rather than enjoying a bonus. After you attempt such a check with the key the first time, it fuses to you, returning to your‌

### Type selenite; Level 15

The target is temporarily immune to the orb’s *see the unseen*

for 24 hours and can choose to be invisible to the orb’s

possession if discarded. To use another device to Pick a Lock, you must first succeed at a DC 20 Will save.

# SLUGGISH BRACELET ITEM 3

RARE

CURSED INVESTED MAGICAL

**Usage** worn; **Bulk** —                           A silver charm bracelet, a *sluggish bracelet* appears to be a *bracelet of dashing*, granting you a +1 item bonus to Acrobatics checks. If the curse goes unrecognized, you think you can Activate it to gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed for 1 minute. Instead, its activation is as follows.

### Activate [one-action] (concentrate) Effect You take a –10-foot penalty to your Speed for 1 minute, and the bracelet fuses to you. Thereafter, it grants you no bonus to Acrobatics checks, and it imposes a –5-foot status penalty to your Speed.

# SPURNED LUTE ITEM 5

RARE

CURSED MAGICAL

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1                         Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a *spurned lute* is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a virtuoso instrument. (Other *spurned instruments* exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its “partner” musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to Perform, you become stupefied 1 until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a Performance check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute.

# TATTLETALE ORB ITEM 14+

RARE

CURSED MAGICAL SCRYING

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1                       A *tattletale orb* is a polished crystal sphere that appears to function as a *crystal ball*. If those whom you use the orb to scry on roll better than a critical failure on their saving throw, they receive a telepathic message alerting them to the scrying. A success or better at the save allows the target to choose to allow you to scry anyway, knowing they can use an aspect of the orb against you, according to the orb’s type. A creature that rolls a critical success on the saving throw also learns your name and location. Once you Activate a *tattletale orb* or use it to cast one of your scrying spells, it fuses to you. You must succeed at a Will save, using the scrying Will DC of a *crystal ball* of the orb’s type, to use another such device.

*Tattletale orbs* come in the same types as *crystal balls*, with the same activations and powers. However, your target must roll a critical failure on the saving throw for the orb to function as normal for that type of *crystal ball*.                 **Type** clear quartz; **Level** 14

scrying        during        that        time.

### Type moonstone; Level 16

The target is temporarily immune to the orb’s *mind reading* for 24 hours and can use *mind reading* against you instead, as if the target used the orb.                       **Type** peridot; **Level** 17

The target can send you one *telepathic demand*PC2.

### Type obsidian; Level 19

The target is temporarily immune to the orb’s *truesight* for 24 hours. During that time, you see a *false vision* of the target’s choice if you scry on the target. Despite being higher rank than the spell, you can’t disbelieve this illusion if scrying through the orb.

# UNFATHOMABLE STARGAZER ITEM 15

RARE

CURSED MAGICAL

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1                       An *unfathomable stargazer* is a handheld brass telescope etched with constellations, the patterns of which form bizarre, shifting runes. You can observe the night sky with an *unfathomable stargazer*, however, the constellations you glimpse through the telescope distort with expanding and contracting fields of darkness among them. You use Occultism instead of Perception or Astronomy Lore when observing the skies with this item, and gain a +2 item bonus on all checks to do so. Once you use it, it fuses to you, and you must succeed at a DC 35 Will save to use another device to observe the stars, including your naked eyes. The telescope imposes a –4 circumstance penalty to Survival checks to Sense Direction or navigate. If you critically fail this Survival check, you’re subjected to *warp mind* (DC 34) as you glimpse something horrifying and alien amid the darkness.

The branch functions as a *greater verdant staff*, though the arboreal spirit allows only partners willing to

‌safeguard nature to use the staff’s spells. An arboreal who decides to become an *arboreal staff* is more connected to shorter-lived species than others of their kind. Most choose to endure to share their knowledge with future generations, but they take a long view in ways that can be frustrating to their wielders.

In addition to the activation and spells of a *greater verdant staff*, an *arboreal staff* can cast the spells it holds as if it were the staff’s wielder, though it usually does so only to benefit a partner. The staff also has *earthbind* available as a 3rd-rank spell.

# BLEACHGUARD DOLL ITEM 8

RARE

INTELLIGENT MAGICAL

Usage    held    in    1    hand;    Bulk    L

### Perception +16; precise vision (low-light) 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet

### Communication speech (one language spoken by the doll’s creator)

### Skills One Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill chosen by the creator at +16

### Int +3, Wis +3, Cha +3

**Will** +16                                   Rather than seeking out new experiences to stave off the Bleaching, gnome spellcasters with the right know-how can infuse a small fragment of their consciousness into a doll, then send the doll off with a crew of adventurers to experience new things. Such gnomes might have difficulties that keep them from exploring or might be preoccupied with other pursuits, but the doll acts as an intermediary, transmitting the benefits of new experiences to its creator via a potent, but passive, psychic link. A *bleachguard doll* has the demeanor of its creator, but new experiences can cause the two to diverge. The doll’s creator is neither able to control it nor are they constantly aware of its activities. If the original creator perishes, the doll sometimes becomes inert (essentially dying as well), sometimes remains an intelligent item, and sometimes becomes a normal soulbound doll (*Monster Core* 318), diminished in power but with some of the item’s capabilities.

Once per day, the doll sends its creator a dream of the day’s events. Each *bleachguard doll* can cast the cantrips *light* (3rd rank), *prestidigitation*, and one other 3rd-rank cantrip, along with one spell (at 3rd rank) that can be cast once per day. The creator chooses the cantrip and spells, which can’t require an attack roll or saving throw, during the doll’s creation.

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) **Effect** The *bleachguard doll* casts one of its available cantrips or spells.

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The *bleachguard doll* animates per *summon construct* as a soulbound doll, retaining pertinent item statistics, cantrips, and its spell instead of those of the soulbound doll. The soulbound doll can Cast a Spell only if the *bleachguard doll* has a use of that spell remaining for the day. When reduced to 0 Hit Points or this activation

ends, the *bleachguard doll* becomes inert but repairs itself at the rate of 1 Hit Point per hour. This activation is unavailable until the doll has 23 Hit Points again.

Other such objects hold the spirits of Sarenite priests who dedicated themselves to their work beyond death. *Dawnflower beads* function as a *greater shining symbol*. They don’t re-attune to other deities but allow any divine spellcaster who isn’t unholy to use them, though they attempt to talk their wielder out of morally questionable acts. *Dawnflower beads* have the following additional activations.

**Activate** Cast a Spell; **Effect** The beads cast 4th-rank *light*. **Activate** Cast a Spell; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The beads cast 5th-rank *vital luminance* (*Player Core* 379).

The armor is happy to give you and your companions counsel, hoping to guide you on a path of benevolence and aid you in battles against forces that seek to cause harm to the natural world. It refuses access to its magic to anyone who causes undue harm to plants or animals.

In addition to the features and activation of *autumn’s embrace*, *faerie queen’s bower* has the following activation. **Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The armor casts 4th-rank *safe passage*, with the protected area beginning from your square and extending

A *kindled tome* is a *book of lingering blaze* (*Secrets of Magic* 162) awakened to sapience and imbued with an enthusiasm for fire. It encourages you to learn new fire spells to inscribe within its pages. When you attempt a skill check to Learn a Spell to add a spell with the fire trait to the *kindled tome*, you treat your result as one step better than you rolled. The tome can be disparaging about other spells as “a waste of good page space,” especially if those spells have the cold or water traits. In addition to the activation of a *book of lingering blazes*, a *kindled tome* has the following activations.

### Activate [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per hour; Trigger You Cast a Spell with the fire trait; Effect The tome makes the flames linger, dealing 2d6 persistent fire damage to all you hit with or who fail the saving throw against the effect (doubling on a critical success on a spell attack and on a critical failure on a saving throw).

**Will** +14                                     Forged in platinum, a *majordomo torc* is engraved with heraldic insignias along with one language’s alphabet, much like a *choker of elocution*. You gain a +1 item bonus to Society checks and the ability to understand, speak, and write the torc’s language. Your excellent elocution reduces the DC of the flat check to perform an auditory action while deafened from 5 to 3.

Upon being invested, the torc appoints itself your majordomo and, given the chance, takes over coordinating your social calendar, engagements, and wardrobe. A *majordomo torc* has a prim, fussy disposition, and although it defers to you, it can grow sardonic if you frequently ignore its advice. The torc has the following activation.

**Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The *majordomo torc* casts *befitting attire* (*Secrets of Magic* 90) on you, usually to your specifications. However the torc can also choose the appearance of the illusion for you.

It has two *aeon stone* slots, and both stones grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. If both slots are filled, the *wayfinder* and two stones count as two items toward your investiture limit. Most *Pathfinder’s mentors* are eager explorers that object to staying in one location for long, urging their bearers toward ancient ruins to explore, relics to study, and discoveries to make. To this end, the wayfinder acts as a guide, making Survival checks on your behalf during your travels. A *Pathfinder’s mentor* also has the following activations.

### Int +3, Wis +4, Cha +5

**Will** +22                                 When a skilled musician dies before reaching their full potential or accomplishing an important goal, their soul might refuse to move on to the Boneyard. Rather than becoming undead, the spirit possesses an instrument they played in life, turning it into an intelligent item and a virtuoso instrument. (Other *phantom instruments* exist, but most are heavy.) A *phantom piano* offers a bargain to any bard or other skilled musician who finds it: receive musical aid as you dedicate yourself to reaching the success the spirit felt they were denied in life. The piano refuses to play for those who reject this deal. If you accept, the piano asks only that you practice with it and perform for increasingly refined and august audiences, requiring a successful Performance check appropriate to your proficiency rank. The piano sets no strict timeline, but at the GM’s discretion, if you go too long without making progress, the piano can cease cooperating with you until it’s satisfied with your dedication once again. While you keep up your end of the bargain, the piano grants you a +2 item bonus to Performance checks made with it. The piano also provides access to composition spells based on your Performance proficiency rank, as if you had the corresponding feat. The spells you can use comprise a cumulative list, but you can cast them only when using the piano. You must spend the actions and Focus Points required to cast these spells,

which appear on pages 370–372 of Player Core. **Trained** courageous anthem, uplifting overture **Expert** hymn of healing, rallying anthem **Master** symphony of the unfettered heart **Legendary** soothing ballad

Only a handful of mortals can truthfully claim to have seen a toshigami, let alone met one, though many popular fireside tales tell of virtuous souls receiving a toshigami’s blessing to fight for a worthy cause. Such stories have a basis in fact; every so often, a toshigami gives a worthy mortal a flower from their ward, time-locked in perfect bloom and granted sapience. Such *toshigami blossoms* are more sociable than their creators. Like toshigami, a blossom has

A *toshigami blossom* has the following activations.

You and your allies can see through these blossoms. To all other creatures, creatures within the cloud of blossoms become concealed, and creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. When you or an ally succeeds with a Strike against a creature in the blossoms, the Strike deals an additional 1d6 mental damage and an additional 1d6 void damage to living creatures, or an additional 1d6 vitality damage to undead.

**Will** +17                                 *Wrestler’s armbands* are a set of *armbands of athleticism* that have gained their own boisterous sapience. Often, such items aren’t created intentionally but rather are the result of a truly charismatic champion whose heart and body are unusually strong wearing the *armbands of athleticism* on many adventures as their most important item. Eventually, the essence of their earnest and adventurous spirit has so thoroughly inundated the item it gains a matching spirit and will of its own. Such armbands view themselves as a tough, but fair, trainer for whomever inherits them next, inspiring you to new heights of athleticism. They also spoil for contests, telepathically calling out competitors on your behalf; typically the armbands won’t challenge a foe you’re unprepared to face, but particularly eager *wrestler’s armbands* might have an unfortunate habit of overestimating your abilities and pushing you into a conflict that’s beyond your proven capacity. These armbands have the following activation.

### Activate [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per minute; Trigger You succeed or critically succeed at an Athletics check; Effect The armbands taunt a creature you’re competing with, boasting of your prowess and attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that creature.

‌RELICS‌‌‌‌‌

## Psst! Over here! The boss didn’t see you, did she? Okay. This vault is something special, something secret, something AMAZING! The things in this vault, they’re not just treasures, they’re stories. Every single item in here was a tool used by an amazing hero who did fantastic deeds and created their own legends, and each item is part of that legend. Some of them are even parts of multiple legends, passed from

## one hero to the next. If I ever leave to go adventuring, I’d like a legendary relic like one of these to be part of my story!

## —Purepurin

New Aspects

The aspects possible for a relic are as varied as the beings and magic that cause relics to manifest their powers. This section adds several new aspects to relics found in other books, such as *GM Core* (pages 308–319).

ARTISTRY GIFTS

The artistry aspect grants gifts that improve your artistic expression and your ability to impress others with it.

# FASCINATING MINOR GIFT

MENTAL

**Aspect** artistry                                 You gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat while wearing or wielding the relic, even if you don’t meet its prerequisites. If you critically succeed against an observer, that target doesn’t become temporarily immune to this effect.

# INSPIRING MINOR GIFT

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| EMOTION | MENTAL |

**Aspect** artistry                                   **Activate** [one-action] (concentrate) **Effect** You create a vision of a token you could have crafted or make a short performance to inspire an ally within 60 feet. This otherwise works as the

uplifting overture cantrip.

# MUSE MINOR GIFT

**Aspect** artistry; **Prerequisites** The relic is 3rd level or higher.  The relic guides you in your art like a muse, giving you inspirational ideas and providing an item bonus to Crafting or Performance checks. (Choose one. If your relic allows you to do so, you can take this gift again to choose the other.) If the relic is 3rd level or higher, you gain a +1 item bonus. Once the relic attains 9th level, the bonus increases to +2. The bonus increases to +3 when the relic is 17th level.

# CHARMING MAJOR GIFT

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUDITORY | EMOTION | INCAPACITATION | MENTAL |

**Aspect** artistry                                     **Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You speak briefly about your craft or enact a short

performance. The relic casts *charm* at a rank equal to half its own.

# ENTHRALLING MAJOR GIFT

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| AUDITORY | EMOTION |

**Aspect** artistry                                     **Activate** [two-actions] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You speak at length about or demonstrate your craft, or you enact a performance. The relic casts *enthrall*

at a rank equal to half its own. If you have legendary proficiency in Crafting or Performance, creatures can’t critically succeed on their saves against this spell. You can use Sustain an Activation to sustain the effect as you would the spell.

# ARTISTIC PERFECTION GRAND GIFT

**Aspect** artistry                               Your relic enhances your skill with Crafting or Performance. (Choose one.) If you succeed at a check with the chosen skill, you get a critical success instead.

EMOTION GIFTS

A relic with the emotion aspect embodies a single strong emotion, chosen from among anger, awe, dedication, fear, hatred, joy, love, misery, pride, or remorse. These gifts sometimes refer to these emotional states in *Secrets of Magic* 196–197, but they don’t use an emotional focus. Instead, if a gift is based on dedication or love, its emotional focus is any one of your allies, chosen when you initiate the effect; if the gift is based on hatred, its emotional focus is any one of your enemies, also chosen when you initiate the effect.

# DOMINANT EMOTION MINOR GIFT

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| EMOTION | MENTAL |

**Aspect** emotion                                 **Activate** [reaction] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per hour; **Trigger** You would be adversely affected by an emotion effect; **Effect** The relic tries to neutralize the triggering effect with its own emotion, attempting a counteract check. If the check succeeds, you feel a sudden rush of the relic’s emotion and

the counteracted effect doesn’t take hold of you.

EMOTION MENTAL

**Activate** [one-action] (concentrate) **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** You gain the emotional fervor benefits for your relic’s emotional state (*Secrets of Magic* 196–197) for the next 3 rounds, but ignore the spell associated with the fervor. The feeling wears off quickly, so you experience no emotional fallout.

# EMOTION CONDUIT MAJOR GIFT

| --- | --- |
| EMOTION | MENTAL |

### Aspect emotion

### Activate [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Effect You channel your relic’s emotion at a target within 30 feet, overpowering an emotion effect on that creature.

LUCK GIFTS

A relic with the luck aspect is tied to supernatural forces of fortune and misfortune. It lets you manipulate luck.

# BEGINNER’S LUCK MINOR GIFT

FORTUNE

### Aspect luck

### Activate [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per day; Trigger You attempt a d20 roll you’re untrained in; Effect You treat your proficiency bonus as equal to half your level, or if the relic is 7th level or higher, as equal to your level.

Until you make your next daily preparations, you can substitute that number for one d20 roll made for a saving throw or skill check you have to make against an effect created by an enemy, hazard, or the environment. Doing so is a fortune effect. If you fail to do so before your next daily preparations, you lose the stored number.

It knows languages fitting its backstory, usually from among those you know.

The relic is also trained in three skills, increasing one skill’s proficiency each time the relic gains a new gift. Your relic’s mental attribute modifiers begin at +3, +2, and +1, arranged as you choose. The relic is also trained in Will saves, and its proficiency increases as yours does. Each time you gain a new gift, increase one of the relic’s mental attribute modifiers by 1. The relic otherwise functions as normal for an intelligent item.

If you’re sanctified to holy or to unholy, you can choose to have your relic sanctified in the same way.

Set Relics

Some permanent magic items are strongly attuned to one another, forming a relic seed called a set relic or item set. Such items fit a theme, empowering a specific type of character. A set relic grants gifts and benefits based on its items working and growing more powerful in concert.

SET RELICS IN THE CAMPAIGN

Set relics are more powerful than typical relic seeds, but they also make acquiring treasure more exciting. To balance things, ensure each character has access to a set relic suited to their abilities. Also, consider what it takes for characters to acquire this considerable power. Seeking the items or materials to craft them should lead to specific quests and challenges, or even whole adventures. Strongly consider adjusting treasure (as detailed on page 309 of *GM Core*) to account for these valuable items.

200

‌STARTING A SET RELIC‌‌‌

A character starts a set relic when they acquire one item from the set, usually the lowest-level item. (You can allow

for items of their type, with runes and to higher-level

versions. If a set relic lists a specific advanced form of an                  item, you must possess that form of the item and properly

characters to start the set with a different item.) This starting item has a minor gift and two aspects, as with other relics. The set then works as a single relic regarding its aspects and relic level.

UTILIZING A SET RELIC

A user must carry or wear items comprising a set relic to gain their benefits as part of the set. Any item the set relic’s wielder fails to wear or carry, as well as any item stowed in an extradimensional space, doesn’t count toward the gifts and item-number features the set relic can grant. The character must also invest any item that has the invested trait, or that item doesn’t count for the power of the set relic. Consequently, if a user loses an item that’s part of the set relic, any benefits that item brought to the set relic disappear until the item is recovered, invested if necessary, and carried or worn again.

ADVANCING A SET RELIC

Each part of a set relic that a character collects further empowers the relic’s gifts and provides additional features.

**Gifts:** A set relic grants you gifts based on the number of items properly utilized as part of the set relic, as well as a minimum level, which the wielder’s level must equal or exceed. This progression matches that detailed on the Relic Gifts table on page 309 of *GM Core* in terms of number of gifts, minimum level, gift type, and gp equivalent. Each known set relic (see the sets presented below) shows a number before listing a gift. This number corresponds with the number of gifts on the Relic Gifts table, as well as the number of items in the set relic that must be properly utilized to access the indicated gift.

Collective Features: A set relic also grants its user features, boosting to the relic’s gifts, based on the number of items properly utilized in the relic. Such features are cumulative. Once a character has four items from a set, for instance, that wielder gains the features for having two, three, and four items. Each known set relic lists the number of items and the feature linked with properly utilizing that number of items as part of the set relic.

Smaller Sets: For set relics that have fewer than five items, the relic can still permit the wielder to access gifts that are more powerful. One of the items in the set must be of or higher than the minimum level given for the gift on the Relic Gifts table for the relic to grant the gift. Meeting this requirement might involve the wielder improving an existing item to the appropriate level or finding a new item of a suitable level.

Improving Set Items: The items in a set relic need not remain static. They can be improved, according to rules

utilize it to gain its benefits as part of the set relic.

KNOWN SET RELICS

Several set relics are known to exist. You can adjust them with items tailored to your players’ characters or create custom sets, using the benefits described here as a guideline. Set relics in this section use aspects found in this book or in *GM Core*.

| HOLY | RELIC |

**Aspects** beast and celestial                         An *agathion raiment* aids its wearer in finding diplomatic solutions to conflicts when possible, fighting evil directly when it’s not, and guiding others along the path to redemption.

This set functions only for holy creatures.         **Set Items:** *Flask of fellowship*SoM (level 2), *envisioning aeon stone* (level 8), *messenger’s ring* (level 9), *holy chain* (level

  ### Collective Features: The set grants the following features.

* Three Items: The claws you gain from feral claws gain the holy and magical traits and deal an additional 1d4 spirit damage.
* Four Items: You and your allies affected by righteous call deal 1d4 additional spirit damage with successful Strikes. This 1d4 is cumulative with that from your feral claws and damage from the holy rune effect you gain from righteous call.
* Five Items: In your form of fury, you have darkvision and gain 20 additional temporary Hit Points, but you have weakness 5 to unholy. You don’t need to change your size to gain the benefits, other than reach, of a higher-rank battle form. Also, your unarmed attacks from this form have the holy weapon property rune.

* Four Items: The psychic scream gift creates a 30-foot-radius burst.
* Five Items: Treat the outcomes of skill checks you roll to Identify Magic, Learn a Spell, and Recall Knowledge as one degree of success better.

Though each set contains the same items, they all have unique styles, from the elegant, rose-themed decor of the blazon of Taldan swashbuckler Miralla d’Asivran to the spiked sword and attire of Kuthonite maestro duelist Essinte Zaim. Duelists have been known to challenge one another over the set’s

  components.

    RELIC

**Aspects** emotion—dedication [(page 198)](#bookmark447) and life               According to tales, some of the first monks to assemble the austere *monk’s attire* were servants of Irori. This deity is a symbol of devotion and self-discovery through one’s understanding of body, mind, and soul. *Monk’s attire* resonates with Irori’s dedication, focusing on the highest gain from minimal acquisition, eschewing material objects.

  PHARASMA’S         COMMAND

  RELIC

**Aspects** life and time [(page 200](#bookmark451))                     Pharasma’s devoted followers vow to seek out and destroy undead wherever they can be found, a task made more urgent with the rise of Tar-Baphon. Though the Whispering Tyrant was prevented from taking over Golarion, his forces are still massing. Undead unaffiliated with the lich represent an unacceptable perversion of the cycle of life and death to Pharasmins, and permitting such creatures to exist is anathema to her. To aid her faithful in their sacred duty to send the dead where they belong, Pharasmin priests developed this item set. While using *Pharasma’s command*, you must abide by her edicts and anathema or else the relic ceases to function for you until you atone. This set doesn’t function for undead beings.           **Set Items:** *+1 dagger* (level 2), *symbol of conflict* (level 4), *wand of overflowing life*PC2 (level 9), *devoted vestments* (level 11) or *greater cloister robe* (level 15, [page 148),](#bookmark303) *true staff of*

* Five Items: When you use temporal pulse, each creature you slow takes 1d4 damage per relic level, and each creature you quicken regains 1d4 Hit Points per relic level. For living creatures, the damage is void, but it’s vitality for undead.

  SEER’S            ARRAY

  RELIC

**Aspects** mind and time                         Diviners through the ages have employed a variety of tools to glimpse the future, but one who assembles five pieces of a *seer’s array* gains strong second sight. *Seer’s arrays* can be found across Golarion, from the caravans of Varisian harrowers to the scale diviners at the court of the Dragon King of Xa Hoi. A diviner who wears the array is bound to be sought after for counsel, and those who consult such farsighted individuals do well to heed any advice given.                       **Set Items:** *Pendant of the occult* (level 3), *staff of the unblinking eye* (level 6), *lesser clarity goggles* (level 8; [page 146),](#bookmark300)

The origins of the *watch of lost ages*, a silver pocket watch, are enigmatic. Its construction matches no known culture, and its appearance shifts back and forth from battered and tarnished to shiny and new without cause or apparent reason.
